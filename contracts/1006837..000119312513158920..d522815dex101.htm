-vii-  EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

THIS EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made this 17th day of
April, 2013, by and among Rogers Communications Inc., a corporation organized
under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada (the " _Purchaser_
"), Primus Telecommunications Group, Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), and Primus Telecommunications Canada Inc., a corporation
organized under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada (the " _Seller_
").

WHEREAS, BLACKIRON Data ULC, an unlimited liability company organized under
the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada (the " _Company_ "), is a
direct wholly owned Subsidiary of the Seller;

WHEREAS, the Company owns or has licenses or leases to use the assets, rights,
obligations and liabilities comprising the Business; and

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained in
this Agreement, the Purchaser desires to acquire from the Seller all of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity interests of
the Company (collectively, the " _Equity Interests_ "), and the Seller desires
to sell to the Purchaser all of the Equity Interests.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants
and agreements herein contained, and other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

PURCHASE AND SALE OF EQUITY INTERESTS

 

1.1 Purchase and Sale of Equity Interests. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Seller shall sell, assign,
transfer, convey and deliver to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall
acquire, all of the Equity Interests, free and clear of all Encumbrances
(other than restrictions on transfer of securities under applicable
securities Laws).

1.2 Purchase Price.

(a) The aggregate consideration to be paid by the Purchaser to the Seller at
the Closing in respect of the Equity Interests (the " _Purchase Price_ ")
shall equal the sum of:

 

(i) C$200,000,000 (two hundred million Canadian dollars);

(ii) plus the amount, if any, by which Estimated Closing Working Capital
exceeds Target Working Capital, or less the amount, if any, by which the
Target Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital;

(iii) plus the Estimated Net Closing Date Cash.

 



1 (b) At the Closing, the Purchaser shall disburse the Purchase Price as
follows:

 

(i) deposit into an escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") with JPMorgan
Chase Bank, National Association (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") a portion of the
Purchase Price equal to the U.S. dollar equivalent of C$20,000,000 (the "
_Escrow Amount_ "); which Escrow Amount shall be held and disbursed by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Escrow
Agreement; and

(ii) pay the remaining amount of the Purchase Price in cash to an
account specified in writing by the Seller to the Purchaser at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

1.3 Adjustment Amount and Payment. The Parent and the Seller have prepared
and delivered to the Purchaser (i) an estimated balance sheet of the Company
as of the opening of business on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet_ "), such Estimated Closing Balance Sheet to be prepared in
good faith and on the same basis and applying the same accounting principles,
policies and practices that were used in preparing the Balance Sheet, (ii) a
good faith estimate of the Closing Working Capital as of the opening of
business on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ "),
and (iii) a good faith estimate of the Net Closing Date Cash of the Company as
of the opening of business on the Closing Date (" _Estimated Net Closing Date
Cash_ " and, together with the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, the Estimated
Closing Working Capital and the Estimated Net Closing Date Cash, the "
_Estimated Adjustment Amounts_ "); _provided_ that each of the items in
clauses (i) through (iii) shall be accompanied by reasonably detailed
calculations and shall, where applicable, be derived from and calculated in a
manner consistent with the Balance Sheet. The Seller has delivered to the
Purchaser copies of the records and working papers used in the calculation of
each of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Adjustment
Amounts, and the Seller and its representatives have discussed with the
Purchaser and its representatives the Estimated Adjustment Amounts, the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, the calculations thereof and the records and
working papers related thereto.

 

1.4 Adjustment Procedure.

(a) The Purchaser shall prepare a balance sheet of the Company as of the
opening of business on the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "),
such Closing Balance Sheet to be prepared on the same basis and applying the
same accounting principles, policies and practices that were used in preparing
the Balance Sheet.

(b) The Purchaser shall then determine (i) the Closing Working Capital as of
the opening of business on the Closing Date; and (ii) the Net Closing Date
Cash as of the opening of business on the Closing Date; each of which shall
be

 



2  accompanied by reasonably detailed calculations and shall, where applicable,
be derived from and calculated in a manner consistent with the Closing Balance
Sheet (and each of which, along with the deliverables under paragraph (a)
shall be referred to collectively as the " _Adjustment Amount Deliverables_
"). The Purchaser shall deliver the Adjustment Amount Deliverables, together
with supporting documentation evidencing the calculation thereof, to the
Seller within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date.

(c) If within thirty (30) days following delivery of the Adjustment Amount
Deliverables, the Seller have not given the Purchaser written notice of their
objection that the determination of one or more of the Adjustment Amount
Deliverables (i) contains mathematical errors, (ii) with respect to the
Closing Balance Sheet, has not been prepared on the same basis and applying
the same accounting principles, policies and practices that were used in
preparing the Balance Sheet, (iii) have not been calculated using the same
methodology as was used to calculate the applicable Estimated Adjustment
Amount or (iv) otherwise not derived from and calculated in a manner
consistent with the Closing Balance Sheet, then the Adjustment
Amount Deliverables, each as calculated by the Purchaser, shall be binding
and conclusive on the parties and shall be used in computing the Adjustment
Amount. The Seller shall not challenge the amounts set forth in the Adjustment
Amount Deliverables on any basis other than as set forth in clauses (i)
through (iv) of the preceding sentence.

(d) If the Seller duly gives the Purchaser such notice of objection which
notice shall specify in reasonable detail each disputed item, the amount in
dispute and the reasons supporting the Sellers positions, and if the
Purchaser and the Seller fail, after negotiating in good faith, to resolve
the issues outstanding with respect to the Adjustment Amount Deliverables
within thirty (30) days of the Purchasers receipt of the Sellers objection
notice, the Seller and the Purchaser shall submit the issues remaining in
dispute to Ernst and Young LLP for resolution, or if that firm is unwilling or
unable to serve, the Purchaser and the Seller will engage another mutually
agreeable independent accounting firm of recognized national standing, which
firm is not the regular auditing firm of the Purchaser or the Parent. If the
Purchaser and the Seller are unable to jointly select such independent
accounting firm within ten (10) days after such 30-day period, the Purchaser,
on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, will each select an
independent accounting firm of recognized national standing and such selected
accounting firms will select a third independent accounting firm of recognized
national standing, which firm is not the regular auditing firm of the
Purchaser or the Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that if either the
Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Seller, on the other hand, fails to select
such independent accounting firm during this 10-day period, then the parties
agree that the independent accounting firm selected by the other party will be
the independent accounting firm selected by the parties for purposes of this
Section 1.4 (such selected independent accounting firm, whether pursuant to
this sentence or the preceding sentence, the " _Independent Accountant_ "). If
issues are submitted to the Independent Accountant for resolution, (i) the
Seller and the Purchaser shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Independent Accountant such work papers and other documents and information
relating to the disputed issues as the Independent Accountant may reasonably
request and are available to that party or its agents and shall be afforded
the opportunity to present to the Independent Accountant any material

Damages and/or to payment of such Damages as an additional amount to the
Adjustment Amount paid on the date required by Section 1.4(e). Any payment

(a) Except for this Agreement and the Company Plans, Section 3.13(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule lists, as of the date hereof, each of the following types

(i) any Contract pursuant to which the Company paid or received amounts in
excess of $100,000 individually within the 12-month period prior to the date
of this Agreement;

 



16 (ii) any loan, guarantee of Indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond,

other than accounts receivables and payables;

(iii) any Contract entered into after December 31, 2009 or that involved

engaging in business anywhere in the world (including any agreement that
restricts, in any material respect, the Company from competing in any line of
business);

(v) any confidentiality, secrecy or non-disclosure Contract that was entered

(viii) any Contract with any Person with whom the Company does not deal at
arms length within the meaning of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada);

 

(ix) any material agreement of guarantee, support, indemnification, assumption

to occupy, enter in, on, under or over, or use any real property, including
for clarity the Leased Real Property.

  



17 (b) Neither the Seller nor the Company has received written notice that it is
in breach of or default under the terms of any Material Contract where such
breach or default would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Parent or the Seller, no other party
to any Material Contract is in breach of or default under the terms of any
Material Contract where such breach or default would have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, each Material
Contract to which the Company is a party (including as assignee) is a valid
and binding obligation of the Company and, to the knowledge of the Parent or
the Seller, of each other party thereto, and is in full force and
effect, except that such enforcement may be subject to (i) applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now
or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights generally and (ii)
general principles of equity. True, correct and complete copies of all
Material Contracts have been Made Available to the Purchaser.

3.14 Real Properties. The Company does not own, and is not subject or party
(including as assignee) to any agreement or option to own, any real property
or any fee simple interest in any real property. Section 3.14 of the
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete list, as of the date hereof, in
respect of each lease (" _Lease_ ") relating to each parcel of leased real
property (" _Leased Real Property_ "), a description of the leased premises
(by municipal address). Other than the Leases set forth in Section 3.14 of
the Disclosure Schedule, the Company is not a party to, or under any agreement
to become a party to (including as assignee), any lease with respect to real
property. Each Lease is in good standing in all material respects and creates
a good and valid leasehold estate in the Leased Real Property thereby leased.
There is no material default or event of default or event, occurrence,
condition or act, which, with the giving of notice, the lapse of time, or
both, could result in a material reduction of any security deposit provided by
the Company or its predecessor(s) in respect of any Lease. The Company enjoys
peaceful and undisturbed possession of the Leased Real Property under all
Leases in all material respects. Except as set forth in Section 3.14 of the
Disclosure Schedule or otherwise provided in the leases set forth on the
Disclosure Schedule, there are no leases, subleases, licenses or other
Contracts granting to any Person any right to the possession, use, occupancy
or enjoyment of the Leased Real Property.

3.15 Labor. The Company is not a party, either directly, voluntarily or by
operation of law, to any collective bargaining agreement, letter of
understanding, letter of intent or any other labor-related agreement with any
bargaining agent, labor union, labor organization or association which may
qualify as a labor union applicable to Employees, nor is any such agreement
currently being negotiated. No material work stoppage involving the Company is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Parent or the Seller, threatened by any
labor dispute. There are no threatened or apparent union organizing activities
involving any Employees. To the knowledge of the Parent or the Seller, the
Company is operating the Business in material compliance with all Labor Laws.
" _Labor Laws_ " means all applicable Laws relating to employment standards,
human rights, health and safety, labor relations, workplace safety and
insurance and/or pay equity. There are no outstanding or, to the knowledge of
the Parent or the Seller, threatened unfair labor practices, complaints or
applications of any kind, including any proceedings which could result in
certification of a labor union as bargaining agent for any Employees.

 



18 3.16 Insurance. Section 3.16 of the Disclosure Schedule contains a correct
and complete list of material insurance policies which are maintained by the
Company setting out, in respect of each policy, the type of policy, the name
of insurer, the coverage allowance, the expiration date, the annual premium
and any pending claims. The Company is not, and prior to the formation of the
Company, each of Parent and Seller was not, in default with respect to any of
the material provisions contained in the insurance policies, the payment of
any material premiums under any insurance policy and has not failed to give
any notice or to present any material claim under any insurance policy in a
due and timely fashion, in each case to the extent such insurance policies
cover risks of the Business. To the knowledge of the Parent or the Seller,
there are no circumstances in respect of which any Person could make a
material claim under any such insurance policy. Section 3.16 of the Disclosure
Schedule contains a list setting forth any and all material claims,
with reasonable particulars, made under any policies of insurance maintained
by or for the benefit of the Company (or any predecessor) in relation to the
Business over the past twelve (12) months prior to this date.

 

3.17 Finders Fee. Except for fees for which the Seller or its Affiliates
(other than the Company) will be exclusively responsible, none of Parent,
Seller or the Company has incurred any liability to any party for any
brokerage or finders fee or agents commission, or the like, in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of the Seller or the Company.

3.18 Required Consents. Except for the consents, approvals and waivers
described in Section 3.18 of the Disclosure Schedule, there is no requirement
to obtain any consent, approval or waiver of a party under any Material
Contract to which the Company is a party (including as assignee) to any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except where the failure to
obtain such consents, approvals or waivers would not be, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 

3.19 Customers and Suppliers. Section 3.19 of the Disclosure Schedule contains
a true and correct list setting forth (i) the thirty (30) largest customers
of the Business based on monthly recurring payments received by the Company
(or the Companys predecessors in respect of the Business) from such customers
during the month ended December 31, 2012; and (ii) the ten (10) largest
suppliers of the Business based on payments actually made by the Company (or
the Companys predecessors in respect of the Business) to such suppliers
during the 12 month period ending December 31, 2012.

3.20 Assets.

(a) All of the material assets used by the Company are physically located in
the properties set forth on Section 3.20 of the Disclosure Schedule, and at
Closing all of the material assets used by the Company in the Business as of
the Closing Date will be:

(i) owned legally and beneficially by the Company, except for any asset
disclosed as being subject to hire, purchase, lease or rental agreements which
the Company has, and will have at Closing, a legally enforceable right to use;
and

(ii) are, and will be at Closing, all the material assets necessary to conduct
the Business in the manner it was conducted by the Company prior to Closing.

 



19 (b) The Key Assets used by the Company (when taken as a whole) as of the
Closing Date and having regard to their age and condition (having been
maintained in the ordinary course of business) as of the Closing Date:

 

(i) are not subject to any known material defect which materially impairs the
operation of the Key Assets or materially impairs the operation of the
Business as conducted by the Company as of the Closing Date; and

(ii) are in satisfactory working order, except to the extent the failure to
be in satisfactory working order would not materially impair the conduct of
the Business as conducted by the Company as of the Closing Date.

SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN CONNECTION

5.4 Confidentiality; Access to Information.

(a) The Purchaser acknowledges that the information Made Available to it by
the Seller and its Affiliates (or their respective agents or representatives)
is subject to the terms of that certain Confidentiality and Standstill
Agreement, dated as of April 26, 2012, by and between the Purchaser and the
Seller (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Effective upon, and only upon,
the Closing, the Purchasers obligations of confidentiality and non-
disclosure provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement will terminate with
respect to "Confidential Information" (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) relating to the Company and/or the Business; provided, however,
that the Purchaser hereby further acknowledges and agrees that its
confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations in the Confidentiality
Agreement will terminate only with respect to such "Confidential
Information" relating to the Company and/or the Business and that any and all
other "Confidential Information" provided or Made Available to it by the
Seller or its Affiliates (or their respective agents or representatives)
concerning the Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company and/or the
Business) shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in effect in accordance with its
terms to the extent not modified by this Section 5.4(a).

(b) From and after the Closing, Parent and Seller shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, successors and assigns (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Successor) to, retain in strictest confidence (using the same

 



25  degree of care as Parent and Seller accord to their other confidential
information of a similar nature; provided that in no event shall Parent or
Seller exercise less than reasonable care), and shall not use for the benefit
of itself or others, except in connection with the fulfillment of its
obligations or exercise of rights under the Transition Services Agreement,
License Agreement or Commercial Agreements all confidential matters primarily
relating to the Business, or relating to the Purchaser, including "know how",
trade secrets, confidential ideas, concepts, data, customer lists, supplier
lists, mailing lists, details of consultant and employment contracts, pricing
policies, methods, business plans (including marketing plans or strategies),
product development techniques or plans, technical and other proprietary
business processes, designs and design projects, processes, inventions,
software, systems documentation and research projects and other business
affairs and shall not disclose them to anyone outside of the Purchaser,
provided, however, this covenant shall not apply to (i) any information which
Parent or Seller demonstrates is or becomes generally available to the public
other than as a result of disclosure by Parent, Seller or any Affiliate
thereof, (ii) any information which Parent, Seller or such Affiliate are
required to disclose in any legally required government or securities
filings, legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other
similar process or pursuant to applicable regulatory or professional standards
(provided Parent and Seller (a) except to the extent legally prohibited
and to the extent feasible, provide Purchaser with prompt notice of such
required disclosure so Purchaser may attempt to obtain a protective order, (b)
reasonably cooperate with Purchaser, at Purchasers expense, in obtaining such
protective order, and (c) only disclose that information which is required to
be disclosed), or (iii) the use and disclosure of any information for the
purposes of any Tax audit relating to the Business, or any litigation or
dispute resolution in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, any confidential information
disclosed under or pursuant to the License Agreement, the Transition Services
Agreement or the Commercial Agreements, as the term is defined therein, will
be governed by the confidentiality provision of such agreement.

(c) Between the date hereof and the Closing, the Seller shall, subject to
compliance with applicable Laws and any Contracts to which the Seller or any
of its Affiliates (including the Company) is a party, provide the Purchaser
access and the opportunity to make such investigation of the management,
employees, properties, businesses and operations of the Company, and such
examination of the books, records and financial condition of the Company, as
it reasonably requests; provided, however, that neither the Seller nor any of
its Affiliates shall be required to disclose to the Purchaser or any agent or
representative of the Purchaser any information if they believe in good faith
that doing so could result in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a
claim of privilege (including the attorney-client and work product privileges)
or such disclosure would violate any applicable Law or contractual
requirement. Any such investigation and examination will be conducted under
reasonable circumstances after appropriate advance notice and in a manner so
as not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the Business. No
investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4(b) shall affect any representation
or warranty by the Seller in this Agreement or any condition to the
obligations of the Purchaser hereunder.

 



26 5.5 Public Announcements. Each of the Parent, the Seller and the Purchaser may
issue a press release announcing this Agreement. The Parent and the Seller,
on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other, will consult with and
provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any press
release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance of such
press release or other public statement or comment relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press
release or other public statement or comment prior to such consultation
except, in each case, as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with, or requirement of (i) the New York
Stock Exchange, in the case of the Parent or the Seller or their respective
Affiliates, or (ii) the Toronto Stock Exchange, in the case of the Purchaser
or its Affiliates.

5.6 Books and Records.

(a) The Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver, or cause
to be delivered, to the Purchaser at Closing all properties, books, records,
Contracts, information and documents relating primarily to the Business that
are not then in the possession or control of the Company. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing, the Seller will deliver, or cause
to be delivered, to the Purchaser any remaining properties, books, records,
Contracts, information and documents relating primarily to the Business that
are not already in the possession or control of the Company. 

(b) Subject to Section 7.3(a) (relating to the preservation of Tax records),
the Seller and the Purchaser agree that each of them will preserve and keep
the books of accounts, financial and other records held by it relating to the
Business (including accountants work papers) for a period of six (6) years
from the Closing Date in accordance with their respective corporate records
retention policies. If such other party does not confirm its intention in
writing to take ownership and possession of such records within such thirty
(30) day period, the party who possesses the records may proceed with the
disposition of such records. The Seller and the Purchaser shall make such
records, other information relating to the Business, employees and auditors
available to the other as may be reasonably required by such party (i) in
connection with, among other things, any audit or investigation of, insurance
claims by, legal proceedings against, disputes involving or governmental
investigations of the Seller or the Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates, (ii) in order to enable the Seller or the Purchaser to comply
with their respective obligations under this Agreement and each other
agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby or (iii) for
any other reasonable business purpose relating to the Seller, the Purchaser
or any of their respective Affiliates.

5.7 Further Action. From time to time after the Closing Date, and for no
further consideration, each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver such
assignments, transfers, consents, assumptions and other documents
and instruments and take such other actions as may reasonably be necessary to
appropriately consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including (a)
transferring back to the Seller or their respective designated Affiliates any
asset or liability which was inadvertently transferred to, or held

 



27  by, the Company at the Closing, (b) transferring to the Purchaser any asset
or liability contemplated by this Agreement to be transferred to the Purchaser
and which was not so transferred at the Closing and (c) except as otherwise
provided in Article VII, remitting promptly to the Seller or the Purchaser, as
the case may be, any cash amounts actually received for accounts receivable of
the Business generated prior to the Closing Date, in the case of the Seller,
or on or after the Closing Date, in the case of the Purchaser.

5.8 Expenses. Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring or required to incur such expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Parent shall pay any Transaction Expenses incurred by the Company prior to the
Closing and the Parent shall indemnify the Purchaser for the non-payment
thereof and hold it harmless from and against any Damages resulting from the
Parent not paying such Transaction Expenses promptly when due.

5.9 Notice of Developments. 

(a) Until the Closing, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other party
in writing of any fact, change, conditions, circumstance or occurrence or
nonoccurrence of any event of which, as applicable, the Seller or the
Purchaser have knowledge, in each case that could reasonably be expected to
result in any of the conditions set forth in Article VI becoming incapable of
being satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.9(a) shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice, except
as otherwise provided in Section 5.9(b).

(b) During the period between the date of this Agreement and the Closing,
the Seller shall be entitled to update the Disclosure Schedule to the extent
information contained therein or any representation or warranty of the Seller
becomes untrue or incomplete or inaccurate after the date hereof due to events
or circumstances occurring after the date hereof. None of such updates will
be deemed to cure the representations and warranties to which such matters
relate with respect to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section
6.2(a) or otherwise affect any other term or condition contained in this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any right of Purchaser to
seek indemnification with respect to such matters under Article IX hereof).

 

5.10 Intercompany Accounts. Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall (i)
terminate or cancel any and all intercompany accounts and Contracts
(excluding ordinary course arms length trade payables and receivables)
between the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company), on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, (ii) secure the release of
any Encumbrances listed on Section 5.10 of the Disclosure Schedule with
respect to the Company relating to the Indebtedness of Parent and/or the
Seller and the release of the Company from all guarantees or other obligations
relating to such Indebtedness and (iii) and shall cause the Company to
terminate, effective as of the Closing, the Operational Services Agreement,
dated as of January 1, 2013, between Seller and the Company.

 



28 5.11 Indemnification and Insurance.

 

(a) The Purchaser agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses now existing in favor of each Person who is now or
has been prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Closing, a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent, as the case may be, of the
Company as provided in its organizational documents or in any agreement
shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect. The
Purchaser will not, for a period of six (6) years after the Closing, take or
permit any action to alter or impair any exculpatory or indemnification
provisions or insurance coverage now existing in the organizational documents
or any contract, agreement, or policy of the Company for the benefit of any
individual who served as a director or officer of the Company at any time
prior to the Closing (each an " _Affiliate Indemnified Party_ "), except for
any changes which may be required to conform with changes in applicable Law
and any changes which do not affect the application of such provisions or
insurance coverage to acts or omissions of such individuals prior to the
Closing. Without limiting the generality of this Section 5.11, the provisions
of this Section 5.11 are intended for the benefit of, and may be enforced by,
each of the Affiliate Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs.

(b) At the Sellers option and the Sellers sole cost and expense, prior to
the Closing, the Seller may cause the Company to purchase a six (6) year
prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially
equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company (or its Affiliates) with respect to matters arising on or before the
Closing, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained prior to the
Closing, the Purchaser shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force
and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by the Company.

 

(c) The rights of each indemnified individual under this Section 5.11 shall be
in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Person may
have under the certificates of incorporation or by-laws or other
organizational documents of the Company, any other indemnification agreement
or arrangement or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.11 shall
survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and expressly are intended to benefit, and are specifically enforceable by,
each of the indemnified individuals under this Section 5.11.

 

(d) In the event the Purchaser or its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Purchaser shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.11. Without limiting the generality of this Section
5.11, the provisions of this Section 5.11 are intended for the benefit of, and
may be enforced by, each of the Affiliate Indemnified Parties and their
respective heirs.

 



29 5.12 Waiver of Conflicts and Attorney-Client Privilege. The Purchaser hereby
waives, on its own behalf, and agrees to cause the Company to waive, (a) any
conflicts that may arise on account of the representation by legal counsel of
the Seller or the Company in connection with this Agreement (the "
_Current Representation_ ") and the undertaking by such legal counsel after
the Closing of the representation of any current officer, director, employee,
manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate of the Seller or the Company (a "
_Post-Closing Representation_ ") and (b) the Companys rights of attorney-
client privilege with respect to any communication between such counsel and
any such officer, director, employee, manager, member, stockholder or
Affiliate occurring during and in connection with the Current Representation
in connection with any Post-Closing Representation, including in connection
with a dispute with the Purchaser on or following the Closing; provided that
such waivers referred to in clauses (a) and (b) shall not apply to matters as
to which the Purchaser or the Company, at any time following the Closing,
would be materially prejudiced in their respective control of privilege in
connection with any disagreement or dispute with any third party as a result
of any such waivers and advises the applicable legal counsel of such
determination in writing (it being agreed that nothing in this proviso shall
limit such legal counsels ability to represent the Seller or its Affiliates
in connection with purchase price adjustment disputes under Section 1.4 or
indemnification disputes under Article IX of this Agreement).

5.13 Non-Competition. From the date hereof, Parent will not and Parent will
cause its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, whether now existing or formed or
acquired after the date hereof and including the Seller, not to, for a period
of two (2) years, in Canada, directly or indirectly (including through any
agent, representative or other Person):

(a) whether as principal, agent, shareholder, consultant, manager, owner,
partner, limited partner, general partner, joint venture, trustee, or in any
other capacity whatsoever (i) be engaged in a Competing Business, (ii) seek
any approvals or licenses or take any material steps to commence or establish
a Competing Business, (iii) have any financial or other interest, including an
interest by way of royalty or other compensation arrangements, in or in
respect of a Competing Business, or (iii) advise, lend money to or guarantee
the debts or obligations of a Competing Business; and

(b) (i) contact any existing customer of the Business for the purpose of
diverting such customers business away from the Company or its Affiliates or
(ii) otherwise interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt the business
relationship, contractual or otherwise, between the Company or its Affiliates,
on the one hand, and any of its customers, on the other hand; provided,
however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, this Section 5.13 shall not
prohibit Parent or its direct or indirect Subsidiaries from (x) contacting,
soliciting business from or providing services to any customer solely to the
extent such activity is related to a business that is not a Competing
Business, or (y) general solicitations which are not specifically targeted at
customers of the Business as of the Closing and, solely relate to a business
that is not a Competing Business.

 

(c) Section 5.13(a) shall be deemed not breached as a result of (i) the
ownership by Parent or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries of (x) less
than an aggregate of 5% of any class of stock of a publicly-held corporation
that is traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter
market, which is engaged, directly or indirectly, in a Competing Business, or
(y) less than 10% in value of any instrument of indebtedness of a person
engaged, directly or indirectly, in a Competing Business; or (ii) Parent or
any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries engaging, directly or
indirectly, in a Competing Business if the Competing Business accounts for
less than 10% of such Persons consolidated annual revenues.

 



30 The term " _Competing Business_ " means the provision of colocation, cloud
computing (public, hybrid and private), managed services (system admin,
storage and security), managed networks, and shared and dedicated server
hosting service offerings of the Company in existence as of the Closing Date,
in each case to the existing customers of the Company in Canada as of the
date hereof.

5.14 No Solicitation.

 

(a) Promptly following its execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Parent and each of its Subsidiaries shall and shall cause
their representatives to (i) cease to make available non-public information
regarding the Company to any third party or its representatives (and for the
avoidance of doubt promptly terminate access to any electronic data room), and
(ii) cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with
any person with respect to any Alternative Proposal, and the Parent shall
deliver a written notice to each such person to the effect that the Parent is
ending all discussions and negotiations with such person with respect to any
Alternative Proposal, effective on and from the date of this Agreement. Such
notice shall also request such person to promptly return or destroy all
confidential information concerning the Parent and/or its Subsidiaries.
During the period commencing on the date hereof and continuing until the
earlier to occur of the Closing and the date, if any, on which this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Article VIII, the Parent and its Subsidiaries shall
not, and shall cause its and their respective representatives not to, directly
or indirectly, knowingly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiry with
respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any
Alternative Proposal, (ii) furnish to any person (other than the Purchaser or
its designees) any non-public information relating to the Parent and/or its
Subsidiaries, or afford to any person access to the business, properties,
assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel,
of the Parent and/or its Subsidiaries (other than the Purchaser or its
designees), (iii) engage in discussions regarding any Alternative Proposal
with any person that has made or, to the Parents knowledge, is considering
making, an Alternative Proposal, except to notify such person as to the
existence of the provisions of this Section 5.14, (iv) approve, endorse or
recommend an Alternative Proposal, or (v) cause or permit the Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other similar agreement with respect to any Alternative Proposal.

(b) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any
proposal, inquiry or offer, made by any person or group (as defined under Rule
13(d) of the Exchange Act) other than the Purchaser, its Subsidiaries and/or
any of their respective affiliates or representatives relating to, whether in
a single transaction or series of related transactions, and whether directly
or indirectly, any purchase of the Equity Interests or any sale of the assets
of the Company or any other transaction that could render impossible or
impede the transactions contemplated by thus Agreement.

 



31 5.15 Employee Benefits.

 

(a) The Purchaser agrees that each Employee who continues employment with the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date (a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") shall be provided, for a period extending until the earlier of
the termination of such Continuing Employees employment with such entities or
the first anniversary of the Closing Date, with compensation and benefits
that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation and
benefits provided by the Seller and/or the Company to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement
(i) shall require the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to continue to employ
any particular Employee following the Closing Date, or (ii) shall be construed
to prohibit the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates from amending
or terminating any Company Plan

(b) The Purchaser shall ensure that effective as of the Closing Date, each
Continuing Employee receives full credit (for all purposes, including
eligibility to participate, vesting, vacation entitlement and severance
benefits, but excluding benefit accrual) for service with the Seller and/or
the Company under each of the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and
policies of the Purchaser or the relevant Affiliate, as applicable, in which
such Continuing Employee becomes a participant; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no such service recognition shall result in any duplication of benefits.
Effective as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
relevant Affiliate to, credit to Continuing Employees the amount of vacation
time that such employees had accrued under any applicable Company Plan
or Seller Plan as of the Closing Date. With respect to each health or welfare
benefit plan maintained by the Purchaser or the relevant Affiliate for the
benefit of any Continuing Employees, subject only to any required approval of
the applicable insurance provider, if any, the Purchaser shall (i) cause to
be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability
requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition limitations
under such plan, and (ii) cause each Continuing Employee to be given credit
under such plan for all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee under any
similar Company Plan or Seller Plan for the plan year that includes the
Closing Date for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-
pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the applicable plan maintained by the Purchaser or the
relevant Affiliate, as applicable, for the plan year in which the Closing
Date occurs.

(c) No provision of this Agreement shall (i) create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Continuing Employee, any beneficiary or dependents

 



32  thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect
to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and benefits that may
be provided to any Continuing Employee by the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates or under any benefit plan which such entity may maintain, or
otherwise, or (ii) be construed as in any way modifying or amending the
provisions of any Company Plan or Seller Plan.

 

5.16 Non-Solicitation of Employees. From and after the Closing Date until the
second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent will not and Parent will
cause its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, whether now existing or formed or
acquired after the date hereof and including the Seller (such Persons, the "
_Restricted Parties_ "), not to, directly or indirectly, solicit or endeavor
to entice away, offer to employ, employ or cause to be employed, or aid or
assist any other Person to solicit or employ, whether on a full-time, part-
time, consulting or any other basis any of the Employees of the Company as of
the Closing. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5.16, the
Restricted Parties shall not be precluded or otherwise prohibited from (i)
hiring or employing or having hiring or employment discussions with any
such person a) whose employment has been terminated by the Company or, b) who
voluntarily left the employment of the Company and has not been employed by
the Company in the six months prior to such discussions, and (ii) general
solicitations which are not specifically targeted at the Companys employees,
or hiring employees that respond (without any direct or indirect solicitation
or encouragement by any of the Restricted Parties (other than general
solicitations which are not specifically targeted at the Companys
employees)) to such general solicitation.

35 ARTICLE VII

CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

7.1 Liability.

 

(a) Subject to the procedures and other provisions of Article IX, the Seller
shall indemnify the Purchaser and hold it harmless from and against all Taxes
(or the non-payment thereof) of the Company, the Parent or the Seller for all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Any claims pursuant to this Section 7.1(a) shall not
be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.3. 

(b) For purposes of this Article VII, any liability for Taxes attributable to
a taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date (a "
_Straddle Period_ ") shall be apportioned between the portion of such period
ending on the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Straddle Period_ ") and the
portion beginning on the day after the Closing Date (the " _Post-Closing
Straddle Period_ ") (i) in the case of any Taxes other than sales or use
taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes, withholding taxes, and any Tax
based on or measured by income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle
Period, by apportioning such Taxes on a per diem basis and (ii) in the case of
any sales or use taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes, withholding
taxes, and any Tax based on or measured by income, receipts or profits earned
during a Straddle Period, on the basis of a closing of the books as of the
close of business on the Closing Date. To the extent that any Tax for a
Straddle Period is based on the greater of a Tax on net income, on the one
hand, and a Tax measured by net worth or some other basis not otherwise
measured by income, on the other hand, the portion of such Tax related to the
Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the Post-Closing Straddle Period will be
determined based on the foregoing and based on the manner in which the actual
Tax liability for the entire Straddle Period is determined. In the case of a
Tax that is (i) paid for the privilege of doing business during a period (a "
_Privilege Period_ ") and (ii) computed based on business activity occurring
during an accounting period ending prior to such Privilege Period, any
reference to a "Tax period," a "tax period," or a "taxable period" shall mean
such accounting period and not such Privilege Period.

7.2 Tax Returns.

 

(a) The Seller shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, when
due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the
Company and/or the Business on or prior to the Closing Date, and the Seller
shall prepare such Tax Returns, or cause such Tax Returns to be prepared, in a
manner consistent with past practices and shall remit, or cause to
be remitted, all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns.

(b) The Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all income Tax Returns
that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company after the
Closing Date that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. The Purchaser shall file
or cause to be filed such Tax Returns and will remit, or cause to be remitted,
any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practices and in accordance with
applicable Law. The Seller shall deliver a draft of any such Tax Return to the
Purchaser for its review at least thirty (30) days before the due date of
such Tax Returns. If the Purchaser disputes any item on any such draft Tax
Return, it shall notify the Seller of such disputed item (or items) and the
basis for its objection. The parties shall act in good faith to resolve any
such dispute at least five (5) days before the due date of such Tax Return.

(c) The Purchaser shall prepare all other Tax Returns of the Company that
relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. All such Tax Returns relating to Taxes for
which the Seller is liable under Sections 7.1 and 9.2(a) will be prepared on
the same basis and applying the same accounting principles, policies and
practices that have been used in preparing historical Tax Returns for the
Company, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



36 7.3 Cooperation on Tax Matters; Contests.

 

(a) The Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this Article VII and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. The Purchaser and the Seller agree (A) to retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the
Purchaser or the Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
taxing authority, and (B) to give each other party reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if the other party so requests, each of Parent and the Seller shall allow
the requesting party to take possession of such books and records.

(b) Subject to Section 7.5, the Purchaser and the Seller further agree, upon
request, to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby).

(c) After the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall notify the Seller within
ten (10) days of the commencement of any notice of Tax deficiency, proposed
Tax adjustment, Tax assessment, Tax audit, Tax examination or other
administrative or court proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim with respect
to Taxes (a " _Tax Claim_ ") affecting the Taxes of or with respect to the
Company that, if determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of
time would reasonably be expected to result in an increase in Tax liability of
the Seller or its Affiliates. Thereafter, the Purchaser shall deliver to the
Seller, as promptly as possible but in no event later than ten (10) days after
receipt thereof, copies of all relevant notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. The Seller shall
have the right to control the conduct of any such Tax Claim (at its own
expense) and shall have the right to settle any such Tax Claim.

 

(d) If any Tax Claim is of a nature such that the Company is required by
applicable Law to make a payment to any Taxing Authority with respect to

 



37  such Tax Claim before the completion of settlement negotiations or related
legal proceedings, the Purchaser may make (or cause to be made) such payment
and the Sellers shall, forthwith after demand by the Purchaser to the Seller
be paid such payment by the Seller. If the amount of any liability under the
Tax Claim in respect of which such a payment was made, as finally determined,
is less than the amount which was paid to the Purchaser under this Section
7.3(d) the Purchaser shall, forthwith after receipt of the difference from the
Taxing Authority, pay (or cause to be paid) such difference to the Seller,
plus any interest thereon received by the Purchaser from such
Taxing Authority, less any Taxes payable by the Purchaser on such interest,
as reasonably determined by the Purchaser.

7.4 Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements
with respect to or involving the Company shall be terminated as of the Closing

file for and obtain any such Tax refunds or credits to which the holders are

shall not have occurred by the close of business on such date; provided that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be

such party has breached in any material respect any of its covenants or other
obligations hereunder in a manner that has been the principal cause of the
failure to consummate the Closing on or prior to such time; and

(c) by the Parent, the Seller or the Purchaser if there shall be in effect a

with no liability on the part of any party hereto (or any of their respective

shall relieve any party hereto from liability for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement prior to

from any liability for damages resulting from any willful or intentional
breach of this Agreement.

Representations_ ") shall survive indefinitely or until the latest date

warranty, covenant or agreement in respect of which an indemnity claim is
brought pursuant to the terms of this Agreement prior to the Escrow Release
Date shall survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to
the preceding sentences if notice of the inaccuracy or breach thereof giving

whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such time in accordance with
Section 9.4.

 

9.2 Indemnification.

(a) Subject to the limitations, procedures and other provisions of this
Article IX, the Seller and the Parent (the " _Seller Indemnifying Parties_ ")
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless (in each case on a joint and
several basis) the Purchaser and its officers, directors, employees and agents
(in each case in their capacity as an officer, director, employee or agent),
and the successors to the foregoing (and their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents, in each case in their capacity as an officer,
director, employee or agent) (each a " _Purchaser Indemnified Party_ ")
against any and all liabilities, damages, losses and all costs or
expenses, including reasonable attorneys and consultants fees and expenses
incurred in respect of Third-Party Claims or claims between the parties hereto
(" _Damages_ "), incurred or suffered as a result of or arising out of (i)

furthermore, then only to the extent that such Damages exceed the Indemnity
Deductible. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the
Indemnity Deductible will not apply to the obligations of the Seller
Indemnifying Parties to indemnify the Purchaser (i) in connection with any
inaccuracy in or breach of any Fundamental Representation made by the Seller,
or (ii) in respect of Damages indemnifiable pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(ii) or

9.4 Procedures.

(a) If any Person entitled to seek indemnification under this Agreement (an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any
Third-Party Claim against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the
Person against whom or which such indemnification is being sought (an "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") is obligated to provide indemnification under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party will give such Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than twenty (20)
days after receipt of such notice of such Third-Party Claim. Such notice by
the Indemnified Party will include a copy of the notice of the assertion or
commencement of such Third-Party Claim (to the extent available) and describe
the basis for the Indemnified Partys good faith belief that it is entitled to
indemnification hereunder, and indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
estimable, of the Damages that have been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
will be entitled to participate in the 

 



41  defense thereof and, if it so chooses, assume control of the defense thereof
(subject to the limitations set forth in Article IX) by giving to the
Indemnified Party written notice within twenty (20) days after receipt of the
notice contemplated in the preceding sentence of its intention to assume
control of the defense of such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party
will not be liable for any legal expenses (subject to the limitations set
forth in Article IX) subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party may participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim
with its own counsel at its own expense. The Indemnified Party may take any
actions reasonably necessary to defend such Third-Party Claim prior to the
time that it receives notice from the Indemnifying Party as contemplated in
the preceding sentence. If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume
control of the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may
assume and control its own defense without prejudice to the ability of the
Indemnified Party to enforce its claim for indemnification hereunder, and the
Indemnifying Party will be liable for all reasonable costs and expenses
(including legal expenses) paid or incurred by the Indemnified Party in
conducting such defense if the Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnification hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable for the costs and expenses of more than one counsel
for all Indemnified Parties.

 

(b) Without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party will not enter into any settlement of any Third-Party
Claim which would lead to liability or create any financial or other
obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party for which the Indemnified
Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder, or which provides for
injunctive or other non-monetary relief applicable to the Indemnified Party,
or which involves any finding or admission of any violation of Law or
admission of any wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party, or does not include a
complete and unconditional release of all Indemnified Parties. The
Indemnified Party shall not settle a Third Party Claim without obtaining the
consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and any such settlement without
the Indemnifying Partys consent shall be deemed a waiver of the Indemnified
Partys right to indemnification hereunder with respect to such Third Party
Claim. The Indemnified Party will provide the Indemnifying Party with
reasonable access during normal business hours to books, records and
employees of the Indemnified Party necessary in connection with the
Indemnifying Partys control of or participation in the defense of any Third-
Party Claim which is the subject of a claim for indemnification by an
Indemnified Party hereunder.

(c) Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of Damages that does
not result from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") will be asserted
by giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof.
Such notice by the Indemnified Party will describe the Direct Claim in
reasonable detail the basis for the Indemnified Partys good faith belief
that it is entitled to indemnification hereunder, and indicate the estimated
amount, if reasonably estimable, of the Damages that have been or may be
sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will have a period
of twenty (20) days within which to respond in writing to such Direct Claim.
If the Indemnifying Party objects to such Direct Claim it shall give the
Indemnified Party prompt written notice thereof (such notice to describe, in
reasonable detail, the reasons

 



42  for the Indemnifying Partys good faith belief that it is not required to
provide indemnification hereunder). If the Indemnifying Party does not so
respond within such twenty (20) day period, the Indemnifying Party will be
deemed to have accepted such claim. In the event that the Indemnifying Party
objects to any Direct Claim, the Indemnified Party will be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and
subject to the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party accepts or is deemed to have accepted any Direct Claim, it
shall promptly pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such Direct
Claim to the Indemnified Party.

(d) A failure to give timely notice as provided in Section 9.4(a), Section
9.4(b) or Section 9.4(c) will not affect the rights or obligations of any
party hereunder, except and only to the extent that, as a result of such
failure, any party which was entitled to receive such notice was materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(e) Any amounts to be paid by the Seller Indemnifying Parties in respect of
indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 9.2(a) shall be made from the
Escrow Account pursuant to the Escrow Agreement; provided that, from and after
depletion of the Escrow Account, any amounts to be paid by the Seller
Indemnifying Parties in respect of indemnification obligations under (x)
Section 9.2(a)(i) solely in respect of any breach or inaccuracy of any
Fundamental Representation, (y) Section 9.2(a)(ii) solely in respect of any
breach of Section 5.4(b), and (z) Section 9.2(a)(iii), shall be paid directly
by the Seller or Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Purchaser.

9.5 No Setoff. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither the
Purchaser nor the Seller Indemnifying Parties shall have any right to setoff
any Damages against any payments to be made by either of them pursuant to
this Agreement or otherwise.

9.6 Adjustments for Insurance and Tax Benefits. If the Indemnifying Party
requests, an Indemnified Party shall submit a claim under any insurance policy
available to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Damages; _provided_
that such submission shall not absolve the Indemnifying Party from promptly
making indemnification payments under this Article IX pending resolution of
such insurance claim. The amount of any insurance proceeds actually collected
by such Indemnified Party shall be remitted by the Indemnified Party to
the Indemnifying Party, net of any amounts incurred by the Indemnified Party
in seeking such collection and net of any increase in insurance premiums, if
(and only if) the Indemnifying Party has actually reimbursed the Indemnified
Party for such amount in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.6.
The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is sought pursuant to this
Article IX shall be reduced by the value of any Tax benefit actually realized
by the Indemnified Party as a result of any such Damages net of any increase
in the Tax liability of the Indemnified Party as a result of the receipt of
any indemnity payment (but only to the extent such Tax benefit results in a
reduction in the Indemnified Partys cash Tax liability as reasonably
determined by such Indemnified Party).

 



43 9.7 Subrogation. Upon making any payment to an Indemnified Party for
any indemnification claim pursuant to this Article IX, the Indemnifying Party
shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights which the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates may have against any other Persons
(including any insurance company) with respect to the subject matter
underlying such indemnification claim, and the Indemnified Party shall take
such actions as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably require to perfect such
subrogation or to pursue such rights against such other Persons (including
any insurance company) as the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates may have.

9.8 Duty To Mitigate. The Purchaser agrees that if there is any breach or
other condition giving rise to an indemnification obligation by the Seller or
the Parent under this Agreement, other than with respect to Tax matters, the
Purchaser shall (and the Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties to) take (and if requested by the Seller or the Parent, cooperate (and
Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to so cooperate) with
the Seller or the Parent in order to take) all commercially reasonable steps
and measures to mitigate the effect, results, damages and consequences of such
breach or other condition. The Seller agrees that if there is any breach or
other condition giving rise to an indemnification obligation by the Purchaser
under this Agreement, the Seller shall (and the Seller shall cause the Seller
Indemnified Parties to) take (and if requested by Purchaser, cooperate (and
the Seller shall cause the Seller Indemnified Parties to so cooperate)
with Purchaser in order to take) all commercially reasonable steps and
measures to mitigate the affect, results, damages and consequences of such
breach or other condition.

9.9 No Duplication. Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

9.10 Limitation on Types of Damages. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY AMOUNTS IN RESPECT OF, AND IN NO EVENT SHALL
DAMAGES BE DEEMED TO INCLUDE INDIRECT OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EXCEPT IF AND TO
THE EXTENT ANY SUCH DAMAGES ARE RECOVERED AGAINST AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY
PURSUANT TO A THIRD PARTY CLAIM.

9.11 Sole Remedy.

 

(a) The parties agree that, except as otherwise provided in Section 1.4,
Article VII, and this Section 9.11, from and after the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy of any party hereto with respect to this Agreement or any
other claims relating to the Business, the events giving rise to this
Agreement and the transactions provided for herein or contemplated
hereby shall be limited to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Article IX.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the parties agree
that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable
damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would
be difficult to determine, and the parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or
equity, without any requirement to the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy.

 



44 9.12 Treatment of Indemnity Claims. Any indemnification payment by the
Seller pursuant to this Article IX shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Final Purchase Price hereunder.

to parties to this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used

Any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of any other party hereto, (b) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any other party
hereto or (c) waive compliance by any other party hereto with any of the

assignee for all such obligations under this Agreement; provided, further,
that the Seller may assign without any such written consent, any or all of its
rights and obligations hereunder (except for any such rights or obligations
under Sections 5.4, 5.13 and 5.16) to the Parent, and any such assignment
shall relieve the Seller of all obligations under this Agreement, with the
Parent to remain liable for all such obligations under this Agreement. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall

assigns. In the event that, following the Closing, (i) all or substantially
all of the equity interests of Parent or any of its direct or
indirect Subsidiaries, or (ii) all or substantially all of the assets of

PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL PROVISION. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY THIS SECTION 10.9.

to rely on the provisions of this Agreement in any action, suit, proceeding,
hearing or other forum. The Parties reserve their right to vary or rescind the
rights at any time and in any way whatsoever, if any, granted by or under this
Agreement to any Person who is not a Party, without notice to or consent
