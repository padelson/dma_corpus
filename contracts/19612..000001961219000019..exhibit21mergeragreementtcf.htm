only at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all
conditions at the Closing), unless extended by mutual agreement of the Parties
(the "Closing Date").

certificates of merger with respect to the Merger (the "Certificates of
Merger") to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the

and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Certificates
of Merger.

1.4. Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the MBCA
and this Agreement.



1.5. Conversion of TCF Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Chemical, TCF or the holder of
any of the following securities:

(a) Each share of 5.70% Series C Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of TCF (the "TCF Preferred Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for shares of TCF
Preferred Stock owned by TCF as treasury stock or owned by TCF or Chemical (in
each case other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted), shall be converted into the right to receive, without
interest, one share of a newly created series of preferred stock of Chemical
having the powers, preferences and rights in the form set forth in Exhibit 1
attached hereto (all shares of the newly created series of preferred stock,
the "New Chemical Preferred Stock").

(b) Subject to Section 2.2(f), each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of TCF (the "TCF Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except for shares of TCF Common Stock owned by
TCF as treasury stock or owned by TCF or Chemical (in each case other than in
a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted),
shall be converted into the right to receive, without interest, 0.5081 shares
(the "Exchange Ratio" and such shares, the "Merger Consideration") of common
stock, par value $1.00 

per share, of Chemical (the "Chemical Common Stock"). The TCF Common Stock,
together with the TCF Preferred Stock, is referred to herein as the "TCF
Capital Stock."

(c) All of the shares of TCF Capital Stock converted into the right to receive
Chemical Common Stock or New Chemical Preferred Stock, as applicable, pursuant
to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each
certificate (each, a "Certificate," it being understood that any reference
herein to "Certificate" shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry
account statements relating to the ownership of shares of TCF Capital Stock or
Chemical capital stock, as applicable) previously representing any such shares
of TCF Capital Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (i)
in the case of TCF Common Stock, (A) a Certificate representing the number of
whole shares of Chemical Common Stock which such shares of TCF Common Stock
represented by such Certificate have been converted into the right to receive
pursuant to Section 1.5(b), (B) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the
shares of TCF Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted
into the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(f), without any interest
thereon, and (C) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2 or (ii) in the case of TCF
Preferred Stock, (A) a Certificate representing shares of the applicable

Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted into the right to
pursuant to Section 1.5(a) and (B) any dividends or distributions which the
holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2. Certificates
previously representing shares of TCF Capital Stock shall be exchanged for
certificates (or, at Chemical's option, evidence of shares in book-entry form)
representing whole shares of Chemical Common Stock or New Chemical Preferred
Stock (in each case, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto and, in the case of TCF Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional
shares issued in consideration therefor) upon the surrender of such
Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without any interest thereon. If,
prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Chemical Common Stock
or TCF Capital Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or
exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result
of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, or
there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of TCF Common Stock or TCF Preferred Stock that are
owned by TCF or Chemical (in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency
capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist and no capital stock of Chemical or other consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.



1.6. Treatment of TCF Equity Awards.



(a) Each TCF Equity Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, be adjusted so that its holder
will be entitled to receive upon vesting of such award a number of shares of
Chemical Common Stock (i) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of
TCF Common Stock subject to such TCF Equity Award, as applicable, immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio and (ii)
rounded, as 

applicable, to the nearest whole share (with 0.50 being rounded upward), and
shall otherwise remain subject to the same terms and conditions (including,
without limitation, with respect to vesting conditions (taking into account
any vesting upon the occurrence of the Effective Time that is applicable to
TCF Equity Awards granted to the non-employee directors of the Board of
Directors of TCF ) and cash dividend equivalent rights and other than to
reflect that the TCF Performance-Based Awards that become Assumed TCF Equity
Awards will be service-based vesting awards with the applicable vesting date
to be the last day of the original performance period); provided, however, all
Assumed TCF Equity Awards held by a Continuing Employee shall vest in their
entirety to the extent such Continuing Employee undergoes a Covered
Termination.



(b) Prior to the Effective Time, TCF and the Board of Directors of TCF (or the
appropriate committee thereof administering the TCF Equity Plans) shall adopt
resolutions and take such other actions as necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 1.6, including without limitation the conversion of
the TCF Performance-Based Awards into service-based vesting Assumed TCF Equity
Awards.

(c) Chemical shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of
the TCF Equity Plans and each Assumed TCF Equity Award granted thereunder,
including the reservation, issuance and listing of Chemical Common Stock as is
necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.6. Within
two (2) business days after the Effective Time, Chemical shall prepare and
file with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate form, or a post-
effective amendment to a registration statement previously filed under the
Securities Act (as hereinafter defined), with respect to the shares of
Chemical Common Stock subject to each Assumed TCF Equity Award and, where
applicable, shall use its reasonable best efforts to have such registration
statement declared effective as soon as practicable following the Effective
Time and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement covering
such Assumed TCF Equity Award (and to maintain the current status of the
prospectus contained therein) for so long as such Assumed TCF Equity Award
remains outstanding. From and after the Effective Time, references to TCF in
the TCF Equity Plans shall refer instead to Chemical, and references to TCF
Common Stock shall refer to Chemical Common Stock.

(d) For purposes of the TCF Performance-Based Awards for which the applicable
performance period is not completed prior to the Effective Time and for which
performance is achievable at more than one level, the number of shares of TCF
Common Stock underlying such TCF Equity Award shall be calculated and fixed as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time assuming achievement of the
applicable performance conditions at the greater of (i) target level
performance and (ii) the actual level of achievement of such conditions based
on TCF's performance results through the latest practicable date prior to the
Effective Time. For purposes of the TCF Performance-Based Awards for which
performance is achievable at a single level, the performance condition shall
no longer be relevant as of the Effective Time. For purposes of this
Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

defined in the TCF Financial 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan), in either case,
prior to the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date.

(v) "TCF Equity Awards" means each equity-based award that is granted under

Stock that is subject to performance-based vesting, repurchase or other lapse
restrictions (including each performance-vesting restricted stock unit or

case, that is granted under the TCF Equity Plans and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

1.7. Chemical Common Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
Chemical Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

1.8. Certificate of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation. At the Effective

ARTICLE II 
EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1. Chemical to Make Merger Consideration Available. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Chemical shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
an exchange agent designated by Chemical and reasonably acceptable to TCF (the
"Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for
exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates or, at Chemical's
option, evidence of shares in book entry form (collectively, referred to
herein as "certificates"), representing the shares of Chemical Common Stock to
be issued to holders of TCF Common Stock and the shares of New Chemical
Preferred Stock to be issued to holders of TCF Preferred Stock and, in the
case of TCF Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares (such cash and
certificates for shares of Chemical Common Stock and New Chemical Preferred
Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto,
being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"), to be issued pursuant
to Section 1.5 and paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b) in exchange for outstanding
shares of TCF Capital Stock.

2.2. Exchange of Shares.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than five (5) business days thereafter, Chemical shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to (i) each holder of record of one or more Certificates
representing shares of TCF Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5(b), a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the
number of whole shares of Chemical Common Stock, and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, which the shares of TCF Common Stock represented by such
Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted into the right to
receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions
to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and (ii) each holder of record of one or
more Certificates representing shares of TCF Preferred Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the
right to receive shares of New Chemical Preferred Stock pursuant to Section
1.5(a), a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title 

to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the number of
shares of New Chemical Preferred Stock, which the shares of TCF Preferred
Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been
converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any
dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Upon proper
surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Chemical Common Stock
or that number of shares of New Chemical Preferred Stock, as applicable, to
which such holder of TCF Common Stock or TCF Preferred Stock, as applicable,
shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a
check representing the amount of (A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares
which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or
Certificates representing shares of TCF Common Stock surrendered pursuant to
the provisions of this Article II, and (B) any dividends or distributions
which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to this Section
2.2, and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, or any dividends or distributions, payable to holders of
Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive, upon surrender, the number of whole shares of
Chemical Common Stock or the number of shares of New Chemical Preferred Stock,
as applicable, which the shares of TCF Common Stock or TCF Preferred Stock, as
applicable, represented by such Certificate have been converted into the right
to receive, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of
dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Chemical
Common Stock or New Chemical Preferred Stock shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any such unpaid dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to the whole shares of Chemical Common Stock or the shares of New
Chemical Preferred Stock which the shares of TCF Common Stock or TCF Preferred
Stock represented by such Certificate had been converted into the right to
receive.

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Chemical Common Stock or New
Chemical Preferred Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which
the Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are
registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the
Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by
reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of Chemical Common
Stock or New Chemical Preferred Stock, as applicable, in any name other than
that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered,
or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of TCF of the shares of TCF Capital Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the
Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for certificates
representing shares of Chemical Common Stock, New Chemical Preferred Stock and
cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in this Article II.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Chemical Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or
distribution with respect to Chemical Common Stock shall be payable on or with
respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of
Chemical. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Chemical shall
pay to each former stockholder of TCF who otherwise would be entitled to
receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent)
determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing sale prices of
Chemical Common Stock on Nasdaq as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the
five (5) full trading days ending on the trading day preceding the Closing
Date (the "Chemical Common Stock Closing Price") by (ii) the fraction of a
share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of
Chemical Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 1.5.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of TCF for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be
paid to Chemical. Any former stockholder of TCF that has not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Chemical for
payment of the shares of Chemical Common Stock, New Chemical Preferred Stock,
cash in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions
on the Chemical Common Stock or New Chemical Preferred Stock, as applicable,
deliverable in respect of each former share of TCF Common Stock or TCF
Preferred Stock such former stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Chemical, TCF, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of
TCF Capital Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(g) Each of Chemical and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Chemical or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate
governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made.

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Chemical, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Chemical may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen 

or destroyed Certificate the shares of Chemical Common Stock or New Chemical
Preferred Stock, as applicable, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares and
dividends or distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF TCF

Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by TCF to
Chemical concurrently herewith (the "TCF Disclosure Schedule"); provided that
(i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a
representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in the TCF Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by TCF that such
item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that
such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect on TCF
and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of Article III shall
be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of Article III specifically
referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of Article III to the
extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a
specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such
disclosure applies to such other sections, or (b) as disclosed in any TCF
Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by TCF after January 1, 2018 and
prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained
under the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any
"forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are
similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in
nature), TCF hereby represents and warrants to Chemical as follows:

3.1. Corporate Organization.

(a) TCF is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware and is a bank holding company duly
registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
"Federal Reserve Board") under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended (the "BHC Act"). TCF has the corporate power and authority to own or
lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted in all material respects. TCF is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on TCF. As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse
Effect" means, with respect to Chemical, the Surviving Corporation or TCF, as
the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties,
assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such
party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (provided that, with respect to
this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the
impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") or applicable regulatory accounting
requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or
regulations of general applicability to companies in the industries in which
such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts
or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global,
national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or
acts of terrorism) or in economic or market (including equity, credit and debt
markets, as 

well as changes in interest rates) conditions affecting the financial services
industry generally and not specifically relating to such party or its
Subsidiaries, (D) public disclosure of the execution of this Agreement, public
disclosure or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including
any effect on a party's relationships with its customers or employees) or
actions expressly required by this Agreement in contemplation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (E) a decline in the trading price of a
party's common stock or the failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings
projections or internal financial forecasts (it being understood that the
underlying cause of such decline or failure may be taken into account in
determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred); except, with
respect to subclauses (A), (B) and (C), to the extent that the effects of such
change are materially disproportionately adverse to the business, properties,
assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such
party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies
in the industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the
ability of such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" shall have the
meaning ascribed to it in Section 2(d) of the BHC Act. True and complete
copies of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended,
of TCF (the "TCF Certificate") and the Amended and Restated Bylaws, as
amended, of TCF (the "TCF Bylaws"), as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have previously been made available by TCF to Chemical.

(b) Each Subsidiary of TCF (a "TCF Subsidiary") (i) is duly organized and
validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is
duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under
applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state,
local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of
its business requires it to be so qualified and (iii) has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as now conducted, except with respect to each of clause
(ii) and (iii) as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on TCF.
There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of TCF to pay
dividends or distributions except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a
regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally
applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of TCF Bank
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") through
the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by law, all
premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been
paid when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are
pending or threatened. Section 3.1(b) of the TCF Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a true and complete list of (x) all Subsidiaries of TCF as of the date
hereof (y) all persons (not including TCF Subsidiaries) in which TCF, together
with any TCF Subsidiaries, owns (directly or indirectly) 5% or more of a class
of voting securities and (z) any "covered fund" (as defined in 12 C.F.R.
§248.10(b)) in which TCF, together with any TCF Subsidiaries, owns (directly
or indirectly) any interest. The organizational documents of each TCF
Subsidiary as in effect as of the date of this Agreement have previously been
made available by TCF to Chemical.



3.2. Capitalization.

(a) The authorized capital stock of TCF consists of 280,000,000 shares of TCF
Common Stock and 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per

Stock issued and outstanding, (ii) 9,635,099 shares of TCF Common Stock held
in treasury, (iii) 250,566 shares of TCF Common Stock reserved for issuance

additional 125,287 shares of TCF Common Stock assuming achievement of any
applicable performance goals at the maximum level, (iv) 2,029,144 shares of
restricted TCF Common Stock issued pursuant to the TCF Benefit Plans, (v)
4,769,322 shares of TCF Common Stock reserved in the aggregate for issuance
pursuant to future grants under TCF Benefit Plans, (vi) 7,000,000 shares of
TCF Preferred Stock issued and outstanding, and (vii) no other shares of
capital stock or other voting securities of TCF issued, reserved for issuance
or outstanding. Since January 23, 2019 to the date hereof, TCF has not issued
or become obligated to issue any TCF Common Stock or TCF Preferred Stock other
than pursuant to the exercise of TCF Equity Awards previously granted. All of
the issued and outstanding shares of TCF Common Stock have been duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership
thereof. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have
the right to vote on any matters on which stockholders of TCF may vote. No
trust preferred or subordinated debt securities of TCF are issued or
outstanding. Other than TCF Equity Awards, as of the date of this Agreement
there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls,
rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or
agreements obligating TCF to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire, any such securities. There are no voting trusts,
shareholder agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect with respect to
the voting or transfer of the TCF Common Stock or other equity interests of
TCF. No Subsidiary of TCF owns any shares of capital stock of TCF.

(b) TCF owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares
of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of each of the TCF
Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges, encumbrances and
security interests whatsoever ("Liens"), and all of such shares or equity
ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable (except, with respect to TCF Bank, as provided under 12 U.S.C. §
55) and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the
ownership thereof. No TCF Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of
any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities
representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary.

3.3. Authority; No Violation.

(a) TCF has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and, subject to the stockholder and other actions described below,
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger have
been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of TCF. The Board of
Directors of TCF has determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are in the best interests of TCF
and its stockholders, has declared it advisable and has directed that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby be submitted to TCF's
stockholders for adoption at a meeting of such stockholders and has adopted a
resolution to the foregoing effect. Except for the adoption of this Agreement
by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of TCF Common Stock (the "Requisite TCF Vote"), and the adoption and approval
of the Bank Merger Agreement by TCF as TCF Bank's sole shareholder, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of TCF are necessary to approve this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than
the submission to the stockholders of TCF of an advisory (non-binding) vote on
the compensation that may be paid or become payable to TCF's named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement). This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by TCF and (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by Chemical) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of TCF,
enforceable against TCF in accordance with its terms (except in all cases as
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and
the availability of equitable remedies (the "Enforceability Exceptions")). No
appraisal rights are or will be available to any holder of TCF Capital Stock
under the DGCL in connection with the Merger.

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by TCF nor the
consummation by TCF of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger and the Bank Merger, nor compliance by TCF with any of the terms or
provisions hereof, will (i) violate any provision of the TCF Certificate or
the TCF Bylaws (or the organizational documents of any Subsidiary of TCF) or
(ii) assuming that the consents and approvals referred to in Section 3.4 are
duly obtained, (x) violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation,
judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction applicable to TCF or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets or (y) violate,

benefit under, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse
of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the termination
of or a right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective
properties or assets of TCF or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed
of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which
TCF or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of clause
(y) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations,
cancellations, accelerations or creations which, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on TCF.

3.4. Consents and Approvals. Except for (a) the filing of applications,
filings and notices, as applicable, with Nasdaq and the New York Stock
Exchange, (b) the filing of applications, filings and notices, as applicable,
with the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Merger and

"SEC") of a joint proxy statement in definitive form relating to the meetings
of TCF's stockholders and Chemical's shareholders to be held in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Joint Proxy Statement"), and of the
registration statement on Form S-4 in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus, to be filed with the SEC by Chemical in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "S-4") and
declaration by the SEC of the effectiveness of the S-4, (f) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary pursuant to the DGCL and the
Michigan DLRA pursuant to the MBCA, and the filing of the Bank Merger
Certificates, (g) such filings and approvals as are required to be made or
obtained under the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of various states in
connection with the issuance of the shares of Chemical Common Stock and New
Chemical Preferred Stock (or depositary shares in respect thereof) pursuant to
this Agreement and (h) the approval of the listing of such Chemical Common
Stock and New Chemical Preferred Stock (or depositary shares in respect
thereof) on Nasdaq, no consents or approvals of or filings or registrations
with any court, administrative agency or commission or other governmental
authority or instrumentality or SRO (each a "Governmental Entity") are
necessary in connection with (i) the execution and delivery by TCF of this
Agreement or (ii) the consummation by TCF of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Bank Merger). As of the date
hereof, TCF has no knowledge of any reason why the necessary regulatory
approvals and consents will not be received in order to permit consummation of
the Merger and the Bank Merger on a timely basis.

3.5. Reports.

(a) TCF and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all reports,
registrations and statements, together with any amendments required to be made
with respect thereto, that they were required to file since January 1, 2015
with (i) any state regulatory authority, (ii) the SEC, (iii) the Federal
Reserve Board, (iv) the FDIC, (v) the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, (vi) any foreign regulatory authority and (vii) any self-regulatory
organization (an "SRO") ((i) -- (vii), collectively, the "Regulatory
Agencies"), including, without limitation, any report, registration or
statement required to be filed pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations of
the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency,
and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection
therewith, except where the failure to file such report, registration or
statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on TCF. Except for normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the
ordinary course of business of TCF and its Subsidiaries, (i) no Regulatory
Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of
TCF, investigation into the business or operations of TCF or any of its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2015, (ii) there is no unresolved violation,
criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or
statement relating to any examinations or inspections of TCF or any of its
Subsidiaries 

and (iii) there has been no formal or informal inquiries by, or disagreements
or disputes with, any Regulatory Agency with respect to the business,
operations, policies or procedures of TCF or any of its Subsidiaries since
January 1, 2015, in each case of clauses (i) through (iii), which would
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on TCF.

(b) An accurate copy of each final registration statement, prospectus, report,
schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or furnished to the SEC by
TCF since January 1, 2015 pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act (the "TCF Reports") has been made
publicly available. No such TCF Report, as of the date thereof (and, in the
case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of
effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading, except that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but
before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of
an earlier date. Since January 1, 2015, as of their respective dates, all TCF
Reports filed under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of TCF
has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her
under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-
Oxley Act"). As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding
comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of
the TCF Reports.

3.6. Financial Statements.

(a) The financial statements of TCF and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the TCF Reports (including the related notes,
where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the
books and records of TCF and its Subsidiaries in all material respects, (ii)
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of
operations, cash flows, changes in stockholders' equity and consolidated
financial position of TCF and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal
periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case
of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and
amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC,
in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods
involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the
notes thereto. The books and records of TCF and its Subsidiaries have been,
and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and
any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. KPMG LLP has not resigned (or informed TCF that it intends to
resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of TCF as a result
of or in connection with any disagreements with TCF on a matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on TCF, neither TCF nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether due or to become due) required 

by GAAP to be included on a consolidated balance sheet of TCF, except for
those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated
balance sheet of TCF included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2017 (including any notes thereto) and for liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since December 31, 2017, or in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of TCF and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of TCF or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on TCF. TCF (i) has implemented and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act")) to ensure that material information relating to TCF,
including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and
the chief financial officer of TCF by others within those entities as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to
make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to TCF's outside auditors and the audit
committee of TCF's Board of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect TCF's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (B) to the
knowledge of TCF, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in TCF's internal controls over
financial reporting. To the knowledge of TCF, there is no reason to believe
that TCF's outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(d) Since January 1, 2015, (i) except as disclosed in the TCF Reports filed
with or furnished to the SEC by TCF since January 1, 2015, neither TCF nor any
of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of TCF, any director, officer,
auditor, accountant or representative of TCF or any of its Subsidiaries, has
received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods
(including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and
accruals) of TCF or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim that TCF or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing TCF or any
of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by TCF or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by TCF or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of TCF or
any committee thereof or to the knowledge of TCF, to any director or officer
of TCF. 

3.7. Broker's Fees. With the exception of the engagement of J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC and SenaHill Securities, LLC (for whom Tod Perkins, registered
representative of SenaHill Securities, LLC provided all services through
Perkins Advisors, LLC), neither TCF nor any TCF Subsidiary nor any of their
respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or financial
advisor or incurred any liability for any broker's fees, commissions or
finder's fees in connection with the Merger or related transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. TCF has disclosed to Chemical as of the date
hereof the aggregate fees provided for in connection with the engagement by
TCF of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Perkins Advisors, LLC related to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

3.8. Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

(a) Since December 31, 2017, no event or events have occurred that have had or
would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on TCF.

(b) Except as set forth on Section 3.8(b) of the TCF Disclosure Schedule, and
in connection with matters related to this Agreement, since December 31, 2017
through the date of this Agreement, TCF and its Subsidiaries have carried on
their respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice.

3.9. Legal Proceedings.

(a) Neither TCF nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are
no pending or, to TCF's knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral
or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory
investigations of any nature against TCF or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their current or former directors or executive officers that (i) if adversely
determined, would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to
result in a material restriction on TCF or any of its Subsidiaries' businesses
or (ii) would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on TCF.

(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree or regulatory restriction
imposed upon TCF, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of TCF or any of its
Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Merger, would apply to
Chemical or any of its affiliates) that (i) would, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to result in a material restriction on TCF or
any of its Subsidiaries' businesses or (ii) would reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
TCF.

3.10. Taxes and Tax Returns.

(a) Each of TCF and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (taking into
account all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all
jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all
such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects.
Neither TCF nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any extension of
time within which to file any material Tax Return (other than extensions to
file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course). All material Taxes of TCF
and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Returns) that are due
have been fully and timely paid. Each of TCF and its Subsidiaries has withheld
and paid all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in
connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, stockholder,
independent contractor or other third party. Neither 

TCF nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver of the
limitation period applicable to any material Tax that remains in effect.
Except as set forth on Section 3.10(a) of the TCF Disclosure Schedule, the
federal income Tax Returns of TCF and its Subsidiaries for all years to and
including 2017 have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS")
or are Tax Returns with respect to which the applicable period for assessment
under applicable law, after giving effect to extensions or waivers, has
expired. Neither TCF nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice
of assessment or proposed assessment in connection with any material amount of
Taxes, and there are no threatened (in writing) or pending disputes, claims,
audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding any material Tax of TCF
and its Subsidiaries or the assets of TCF and its Subsidiaries. TCF has made
available to Chemical true and complete copies of any private letter ruling
requests, closing agreements or gain recognition agreements with respect to
Taxes requested or executed in the last six (6) years. Neither TCF nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or
indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or
arrangement exclusively between or among TCF and its Subsidiaries). Neither
TCF nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has been a member of an affiliated group
filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common
parent of which is or was TCF) or (ii) has any liability for the Taxes of any
person (other than TCF or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as
a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither TCF nor any of
its Subsidiaries has been, within the past two (2) years or otherwise as part
of a "plan (or series of related transactions)" within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a part, a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section
355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock intending to qualify for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. Neither TCF nor any of its
Subsidiaries has participated in a "reportable transaction" within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation section 1.6011-4(b)(1). At no time during the past five
(5) years has TCF been a United States real property holding corporation
within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code.

3.11. Employees and Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) Section 3.11(a) of the TCF Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, correct
and complete list of all material TCF Benefit Plans. For purposes of this
Agreement, "TCF Benefit Plans" means all employee benefit plans (as defined in
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA")), whether or not subject to ERISA, and all stock option,
stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred compensation, retiree
medical or life insurance, 

supplemental retirement, retention, bonus, employment, change in control,
termination or severance plans, programs, agreements or arrangements that are
maintained, contributed to or sponsored or maintained by, or required to be
contributed to, TCF or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of any current
or former employee, officer or director of TCF or any of its Subsidiaries,
excluding, in each case, any Multiemployer Plan.

(b) TCF has heretofore made available to Chemical true and complete copies of
(i) each material TCF Benefit Plan, including any amendments thereto and all
related trust documents, insurance contracts or other funding vehicles, and
(ii) to the extent applicable, (A) the most recent summary plan description
required under ERISA with respect to such TCF Benefit Plan, (B) the most
recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the IRS, (C) the most recently
received IRS determination letter relating to such TCF Benefit Plan, (D) the
most recently prepared actuarial report for each TCF Benefit Plan, and (E) all
material correspondence to or from any Governmental Entity received in the
last three (3) years with respect to each TCF Benefit Plan.

(c) Each TCF Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered in
accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable laws,
including ERISA and the Code, except for such noncompliance that has not had,
and would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on TCF.

(d) Section 3.11(d) of the TCF Disclosure Schedule identifies each TCF Benefit
Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (the
"TCF Qualified Plans"). The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter
with respect to each TCF Qualified Plan and the related trust, and, to the
knowledge of TCF, there are no existing circumstances and no events have
occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified
status of any TCF Qualified Plan or the related trust.

(e) No TCF Benefit Plan is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code. During the immediately preceding six (6)
years, no Controlled Group Liability has been incurred by TCF or its ERISA
Affiliates that has not been satisfied in full, and, to the knowledge of TCF,
no condition exists that presents a material risk to TCF or its ERISA
Affiliates of incurring any such liability, except as, either individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in material
liability to TCF and its Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Controlled Group Liability" means any and all liabilities (i) under Title IV
of ERISA, (ii) under Section 302 of ERISA, (iii) under Sections 412 and 4971
of the Code, or (iv) as a result of a failure to comply with the continuing
coverage requirements of Section 601 et. seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of
the Code. For purposes of this Agreement, "ERISA Affiliate" means, with
respect to any entity, trade or business, any other entity, trade or business
that is, or was at the relevant time, a member of a group described in Section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA that
includes or included the first entity, trade or business, or that is, or was
at the relevant time, a member of the same "controlled group" as the first
entity, trade or business pursuant to Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA.

(f) None of TCF, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has, at any time during the last six (6) years, contributed to or
been obligated to contribute to any plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a 

"Multiemployer Plan") or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors, at
least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section
4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan").

(g) Except as set forth on Section 3.11(g) of the TCF Disclosure Schedule,
neither TCF nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors any employee benefit plan
that provides for any post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or
life insurance benefits for retired or former employees or their beneficiaries
or dependents, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

(h) All contributions required to be made to any TCF Benefit Plan by
applicable law or by any plan document, and all premiums due or payable with
respect to insurance policies funding any TCF Benefit Plan, for any period
through the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the
extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been
fully reflected on the books and records of TCF, except as, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in any liability that would be material to TCF and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.

(i) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or
instituted, and, to the knowledge of TCF, no set of circumstances exists that
may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the TCF
Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the TCF
Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the TCF Benefit
Plans, except as, either individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to result in any liability that would be material to
TCF and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) (i) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or
delivery of, cause TCF or any of its Subsidiaries to transfer or set aside any
assets to fund any benefits under any TCF Benefit Plan, (ii) increase in the
amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit to any employee or
director of TCF or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) result in any limitation
on the right of TCF or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or
receive a reversion of assets from any TCF Benefit Plan or related trust. No
amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of
benefits) by TCF or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a
result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

(k) Neither TCF nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any plan, program,
agreement or arrangement that provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of
Taxes imposed under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code (or any corresponding
provisions of state or local law relating to Tax).

(l) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of TCF, threatened material
labor grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges against
TCF or any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other material labor
disputes against TCF or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither TCF nor any of its
Subsidiaries is party to or bound by any collective bargaining or similar
agreement 

with any labor organization, or work rules or practices agreed to with any
labor organization or employee association applicable to employees of TCF or
any of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of TCF, there are no organizing
efforts by any union or other group seeking to represent any employees of TCF
and its Subsidiaries.

3.12. Compliance with Applicable Law.

(a) TCF and each of its Subsidiaries hold, and have held at all times since
January 1, 2015, all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations
necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses and ownership
of their respective properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each
(and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection
therewith), except where neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of
obtaining and holding such license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor
the failure to pay any fees or assessments) would, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
TCF, and, to the knowledge of TCF, no suspension or cancellation of any such
necessary license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. TCF and
each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with and are
not in material default or violation under any applicable law, statute, order,
rule, regulation, policy and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating
to TCF or any of its Subsidiaries, including without limitation all laws
related to data protection or privacy, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy
Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Fair Housing Act,

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on TCF (each, whether or not set forth in
the TCF Disclosure Schedule, a "TCF Regulatory Agreement"), nor has TCF or any
of its Subsidiaries been advised in writing, or to TCF's knowledge, orally,
since January 1, 2015, by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity
that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering, or requesting any such
TCF Regulatory Agreement.

to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on

Subsidiaries enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as may be
limited by the Enforceability Exceptions), and are in full force and effect.
TCF and each of its Subsidiaries have duly performed in all material respects
all of their material obligations thereunder to the extent that such
obligations to perform have accrued, and, to TCF's knowledge, there are no
material breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such
by any party thereunder. 

3.16. Environmental Matters. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
TCF, TCF and its Subsidiaries are in compliance, and have complied since

on TCF or any of its Subsidiaries of any liability or obligation arising under
any Environmental Law, pending or threatened against TCF, which liability or
obligation would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on TCF. To the knowledge of TCF, there is

reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on TCF.

and clear of all Liens, except (i) statutory Liens securing payments not yet
due, (ii) Liens for real property Taxes not yet due and payable, (iii)
easements, rights of way, and other similar encumbrances that do not
materially affect the value or use of the properties or assets subject thereto
or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations at such

do not materially affect the value or use of the properties or assets subject
thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations
at such properties (clauses (i) through (iv), collectively, "Permitted
Encumbrances"), and (b) is the lessee of all leasehold estates reflected in
the latest audited financial statements included in such TCF Reports or

Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Chemical to
TCF concurrently herewith (the "Chemical Disclosure Schedule"); provided that
(i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a
representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Chemical Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a

such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
Chemical, and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of Article
IV shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of Article IV specifically

4.1. Corporate Organization.

(a) Chemical is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Michigan and is a bank holding company
duly registered with the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act, which has
duly elected to be, and qualifies as, a financial holding company. Chemical
has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted in all
material respects. Chemical is duly licensed or qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Chemical. True and
complete copies of the Chemical Articles and the Chemical Bylaws, as in effect
as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available by
Chemical to TCF.

(b) Each Subsidiary of Chemical (a "Chemical Subsidiary") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and
(iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, except
with respect to each of clause (ii) and (iii) as has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Chemical. There are no restrictions on the ability
of any Subsidiary of Chemical to pay dividends or distributions except, in the
case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends
or distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The
deposit accounts of Chemical Bank are insured by the FDIC through the Deposit
Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums and

current or past shareholder of Chemical will have any preemptive right or
similar rights in respect thereof.

cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of

provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Chemical or any of
its Subsidiaries is 

a party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may
be bound, except (in the case of clause (y) above) for such violations,
conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations or
creations, which, either individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Chemical.

such Chemical Common Stock and New Chemical Preferred Stock (or depositary
shares in respect thereof) on Nasdaq, no consents or approvals of or filings
or registrations with any Governmental Entity are necessary in connection with
(i) the execution and delivery by Chemical of this Agreement or (ii) the
consummation by Chemical of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Bank Merger). As of the date hereof, Chemical has no
knowledge of any reason why the necessary regulatory approvals and consents
will not be received in order to permit consummation of the Merger and the
Bank Merger on a timely basis.

4.5. Reports.

(a) Chemical and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all reports,
registrations and statements, together with any amendments required to be made
with respect thereto, that they were required to file since January 1, 2015
with any Regulatory Agency, including, without limitation, any report,
registration or statement required to be filed pursuant to the laws, rules or
regulations of the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or any
Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report,
registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Chemical. Except for normal examinations conducted
by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of business of Chemical and its
Subsidiaries, (i) no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any
proceeding or, to the knowledge of Chemical, investigation into the business
or operations of Chemical or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2015,
(ii) there is no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any
Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement relating to any

there has been no formal or informal inquiries by, or disagreements or
disputes with, any Regulatory Agency with respect to the business, operations,
policies or procedures of Chemical or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1,
2015, in 

each case of clauses (i) through (iii), which would reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Chemical.

(b) An accurate copy of each final registration statement, prospectus, report,
schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or furnished to the SEC by
Chemical since January 1, 2015 pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act (the "Chemical Reports") has been made publicly available. No such
Chemical Report as of the date thereof (and, in the case of registration
statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates
of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that information
filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement)
shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. Since January 1,
2015, as of their respective dates, all Chemical Reports filed under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. As of the
date of this Agreement, no executive officer of Chemical has failed in any
respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect
to any of the Chemical Reports.



4.6. Financial Statements.

(a) The financial statements of Chemical and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Chemical Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of Chemical and its Subsidiaries in all material
respects, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
results of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders' equity and
consolidated financial position of Chemical and its Subsidiaries for the
respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth
(subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments
normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of
filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case, as
indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records of
Chemical and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all
material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. KPMG LLP has not
resigned (or informed Chemical that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as
independent public accountants of Chemical as a result of or in connection
with any disagreements with Chemical on a matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Chemical, neither Chemical nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any liability (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) required by GAAP to
be included on a consolidated balance sheet of Chemical, except for those
liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance
sheet of Chemical 

included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2017 (including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December 31,
2017, or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Chemical and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Chemical or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Chemical. Chemical (i) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to Chemical, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to
the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Chemical by
others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
Chemical's outside auditors and the audit committee of Chemical's Board of
Directors (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Chemical's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (B) to the knowledge of Chemical, any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Chemical's internal controls over financial reporting.
To the knowledge of Chemical, there is no reason to believe that Chemical's
outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant
to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(d) Since January 1, 2015, (i) except as disclosed in the Chemical Reports
filed with or furnished to the SEC by Chemical since January 1, 2015, neither
Chemical nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of Chemical, any
director, officer, auditor, accountant or representative of Chemical or any of
its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-
offs and accruals) of Chemical or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim that Chemical or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing Chemical or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
Chemical or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
Chemical or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board
of Directors of Chemical or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of
Chemical, to any director or officer of Chemical.



4.7. Broker's Fees. With the exception of the engagement of Keefe, Bruyette and
Woods, Inc., neither Chemical nor any Chemical Subsidiary nor any of their
respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or financial
advisor or incurred any liability for any broker's fees, commissions or
finder's fees in connection with the Merger or related transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Chemical has disclosed to TCF as of the date
hereof the aggregate fees provided for in connection with the engagement by
Chemical of Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc. related to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

4.8. Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Chemical.

and in connection with matters related to this Agreement, since December 31,
2017 through the date of this Agreement, Chemical and its Subsidiaries have
carried on their respective businesses in all material respects in the
ordinary course consistent with past practice.

4.9. Legal Proceedings.

(a) Neither Chemical nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there
are no pending or, to Chemical's knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory
investigations of any nature against Chemical or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their current or former directors or executive officers that (i) if
adversely determined, would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
likely to result in a material restriction on Chemical or any of its
Subsidiaries' businesses or (ii) would reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Chemical.

(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree or regulatory restriction
imposed upon Chemical, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of Chemical or
any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Merger, would apply
to Chemical or any of its affiliates) that (i) would, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to result in a material restriction on
Chemical or any of its Subsidiaries' businesses or (ii) would reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Chemical.

4.10. Taxes and Tax Returns.

(a) Each of Chemical and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (taking
into account all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all
jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all
such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects.
Neither Chemical nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return (other than

Taxes of Chemical and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax
Returns) that are due have been fully and timely paid. Each of Chemical and
its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have
been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, creditor, shareholder, independent contractor or other third party.
Neither Chemical nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any extension 

or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any material Tax that remains
in effect. Except as set forth on Section 4.10(a) of the Chemical Disclosure
Schedule, the federal income Tax Returns of Chemical and its Subsidiaries for
all years to and including 2017 have been examined by the IRS or are Tax
Returns with respect to which the applicable period for assessment under
applicable law, after giving effect to extensions or waivers, has expired.
Neither Chemical nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of
assessment or proposed assessment in connection with any material amount of
Taxes, and there are no threatened (in writing) or pending disputes, claims,
audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding any material Tax of
Chemical and its Subsidiaries or the assets of Chemical and its Subsidiaries.
Chemical has made available to TCF true and complete copies of any private
letter ruling requests, closing agreements or gain recognition agreements with
respect to Taxes requested or executed in the last six (6) years. Neither
Chemical nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax
sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than
such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among Chemical and its
Subsidiaries). Neither Chemical nor any of its Subsidiaries (a) has been a
member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return
(other than a group the common parent of which is or was Chemical) or (b) has
any liability for the Taxes of any person (other than Chemical or any of its
Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract or otherwise. Neither Chemical nor any of its Subsidiaries has been,
within the past two (2) years or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of
related transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of
which the Merger is also a part, a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a
distribution of stock intending to qualify for tax-free treatment under
Section 355 of the Code. Neither Chemical nor any of its Subsidiaries has
participated in a "reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation section 1.6011-4(b)(1). At no time during the past five (5) years

4.11. Employees and Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) Section 4.11(a) of the Chemical Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all material Chemical Benefit Plans. For purposes

compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement,
retention, bonus, employment, change in control, termination or severance
plans, programs, agreements or arrangements that are maintained, contributed

(c) Each Chemical Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered
in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable laws,
including ERISA and the Code, except for such noncompliance that has not had,

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Chemical.

(d) Section 4.11(d) of the Chemical Disclosure Schedule identifies each
Chemical Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code (the "Chemical Qualified Plans"). The IRS has issued a favorable
determination letter with respect to each Chemical Qualified Plan and the
related trust, and, to the knowledge of Chemical, there are no existing
circumstances and no events have occurred that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the qualified status of any Chemical Qualified Plan or the
related trust.

(e) No Chemical Benefit Plan is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code. During the immediately preceding six (6)
years, no Controlled Group Liability has been incurred by Chemical or its
ERISA Affiliates that has not been satisfied in full, and, to the knowledge of
Chemical, no condition exists that presents a material risk to Chemical or its
ERISA Affiliates of incurring any such liability, except as, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected result in
material liability to Chemical and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(f) All contributions required to be made to any Chemical Benefit Plan by
applicable law or by any plan document, and all premiums due or payable with
respect to insurance policies funding any Chemical Benefit Plan, for any
period through the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to
the extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have
been fully reflected on the books and records of Chemical, except as, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in any liability that would be material to Chemical and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

(g) Except as set forth on Section 4.11(g) of the Chemical Disclosure
Schedule, neither Chemical nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors any employee
benefit plan that provides for any post-employment or post-retirement health
or medical or life insurance benefits for retired or former employees or their
beneficiaries or dependents, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

(h) None of Chemical, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has, at any time during the last six (6) years, contributed to or
been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer
Plan.

(i) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or
instituted, and, to the knowledge of Chemical, no set of circumstances exists
that may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against
the Chemical Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their
duties 

to the Chemical Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of
the Chemical Benefit Plans, except as, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in any liability that
would be material to Chemical and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) (i) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or
delivery of, cause Chemical or any of its Subsidiaries to transfer or set
aside any assets to fund any benefits under any Chemical Benefit Plan, (ii)
increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit to any
employee or director of Chemical or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) result
in any limitation on the right of Chemical or any of its Subsidiaries to
amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Chemical
Benefit Plan or related trust. No amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in
property, or in the form of benefits) by Chemical or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a
result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any
other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code.

(k) Neither Chemical nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any plan,
program, agreement or arrangement that provides for the gross-up or
reimbursement of Taxes imposed under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code (or any
corresponding provisions of state or local law relating to Tax).

(l) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Chemical, threatened material
labor grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges against
Chemical or any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other material labor
disputes against Chemical or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Chemical nor any
of its Subsidiaries is party to or bound by any collective bargaining or
similar agreement with any labor organization, or work rules or practices
agreed to with any labor organization or employee association applicable to
employees of Chemical or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of
Chemical, there are no organizing efforts by any union or other group seeking
to represent any employees of Chemical and its Subsidiaries.

4.12. Compliance with Applicable Law.

(a) Chemical and each of its Subsidiaries hold, and have held at all times
since January 1, 2015, all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations
necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses and ownership
of their respective properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each
(and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection
therewith), except where neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of
obtaining and holding such license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor
the failure to pay any fees or assessments) would, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Chemical, and, to the knowledge of Chemical, no suspension or cancellation of
any such necessary license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened.
Chemical and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects
with and are not in material default or violation under any, applicable law,
statute, order, rule, regulation, policy and/or guideline of any Governmental

ARTICLE VI 
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.1. Regulatory Matters.

(a) Chemical and TCF shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Joint
Proxy Statement and Chemical shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the
S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each
of Chemical and TCF shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing and to keep the S-4 effective for so long as necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Chemical and
TCF shall thereafter as promptly as practicable mail or deliver the Joint
Proxy Statement to their respective shareholders and stockholders (as
applicable). Chemical shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to
carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and TCF shall
furnish all information concerning TCF and the holders of TCF Common Stock and
TCF Preferred Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
action.

(b) The Parties shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best
efforts to promptly prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all
necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and
filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and Regulatory Agencies and
Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger and the Bank
Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Regulatory Agencies and
Governmental Entities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as
soon as practicable and in no event later than sixty (60) days after the date
of this Agreement, Chemical and TCF shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, each prepare and file any applications, notices and filings
required to be filed with any bank regulatory agency in order to obtain the
Requisite Regulatory Approvals. Chemical and TCF shall each use, and shall
each cause their applicable Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to
obtain each such Requisite Regulatory Approval as promptly as reasonably
practicable. Chemical and TCF shall have the right to review in advance, and,
to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the
information relating to TCF or Chemical, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the Parties shall act reasonably and as promptly
as practicable. The Parties agree that they will consult with each other with
respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each Party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party shall, to the
extent reasonably practicable, consult with the other in advance of any
meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity that such Party anticipates
to be substantive in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity and
applicable Law, give the other Party and/or its counsel the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings and conferences; and provided that
each Party shall promptly advise 

the other Party with respect to substantive matters that are addressed in any
meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity which the other party does
not attend or participate in, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity and applicable Law.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Chemical
and TCF shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would
restrain, prevent or delay the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Chemical or TCF (or
permit either Party, without the prior written consent of the other Party) to
take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or
restriction, that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on Chemical and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect
to the Merger (measured on a scale relative to TCF and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole) (a "Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition").

(d) Chemical and TCF shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and stockholders (as applicable) and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy
Statement, the S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made
by or on behalf of Chemical, TCF or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) To the extent permitted by applicable law, Chemical and TCF shall promptly
advise each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental
Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such Party to believe
that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval
will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be
materially delayed. As used in this Agreement, the "Requisite Regulatory
Approvals" shall mean all regulatory authorizations, consents, orders or
approvals from (i) the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Merger,
(ii) the OCC in connection with the Bank Merger and (iii) any other approvals
set forth in Sections 3.4 and 4.4 that are necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the Bank
Merger, except for any such authorizations, consents, orders or approvals the
failure of which to be obtained would not reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Chemical.



6.2. Access to Information.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of Chemical
and TCF, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of
the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by
this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries
to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and
other representatives of the other Party, access, during normal business hours
during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel, information technology systems, and
records, and each shall cooperate with the other Party in 

preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of
systems and business operations generally, and, during such period, each of
Chemical and TCF shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make
available to the other Party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state
banking laws (other than reports or documents that Chemical or TCF, as the
case may be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable law), and (ii) all
other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such
Party may reasonably request. Neither Chemical nor TCF nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of Chemical's or TCF's, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such
information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common
interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the Parties) or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
Parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) Each of Chemical and TCF shall hold all information furnished by or on
behalf of the other Party or any of such Party's Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated May 24, 2018, between Chemical and TCF (the "Confidentiality
Agreement").

(c) No investigation by either of the Parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either Party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other Party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

6.3. Approvals of Chemical Shareholders and TCF Stockholders. Each of Chemical
and TCF shall call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
shareholders or stockholders (as applicable) (the "Chemical Meeting" and the
"TCF Meeting," respectively) as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4
is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Chemical Vote
and the Requisite TCF Vote, respectively, required in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other
matters of the type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of
shareholders or stockholders (as applicable) to adopt or approve a merger
agreement. The Board of Directors of each of Chemical and TCF shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from its respective shareholders or
stockholders (as applicable) the Requisite Chemical Vote, in the case of
Chemical, and the Requisite TCF Vote, in the case of TCF, including by
communicating to its respective shareholders or stockholders (as applicable)
its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement) that they approve or adopt (as applicable) this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. However, subject to Sections 8.1 and 8.2, if
the Board of Directors of TCF or Chemical, after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel, and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors, determines in good faith that it would be reasonably likely to
violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend
adoption or approval of this Agreement, then in submitting this 

Agreement, such Board of Directors may (but shall not be required to) submit
this Agreement to its shareholders or stockholders (as applicable) without
recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the
date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of
Directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its
shareholders or stockholders (as applicable) in the Joint Proxy Statement or
an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law;
provided that neither Board of Directors may take any actions under this
sentence unless (i) it gives the other Party at least three (3) business days'
prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable
description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to
take such action (including, in the event such action is taken in response to
a Chemical Acquisition Proposal or TCF Acquisition Proposal, as applicable,
the latest material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the third
party making, any such Chemical Acquisition Proposal or TCF Acquisition
Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable
detail such other event or circumstances) and (ii) at the end of such notice
period, the applicable Board of Directors takes into account any amendment or
modification to this Agreement proposed by the other Party and after receiving
the advice of its outside counsel, and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisor, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless be
reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law to
continue to recommend this Agreement. Any material amendment to any Chemical
Acquisition Proposal or TCF Acquisition Proposal, as applicable, will be
deemed to be a new Chemical Acquisition Proposal or TCF Acquisition Proposal
for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new notice period as
referred to in this Section 6.3. Chemical or TCF shall adjourn or postpone the
Chemical Meeting or the TCF Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time
for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares
of Chemical Common Stock or TCF Common Stock, as the case may be, represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting Chemical or TCF,
as applicable, has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Chemical Vote or the Requisite TCF
Vote, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Chemical or
TCF, as applicable, shall continue to use reasonable best efforts to solicit
proxies from its shareholders or stockholders (as applicable) in order to
obtain the Requisite Chemical Vote or Requisite TCF Vote. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, and subject to the obligation to adjourn or
postpone such meeting as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence,
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, each
of the Chemical Meeting and TCF Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement
shall be submitted to the shareholders of Chemical at the Chemical Meeting and
the stockholders of TCF at the TCF Meeting for the purpose of voting on the
approval or adoption (as applicable) of such proposals and the other matters
contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
either Chemical or TCF of such obligation. Chemical and TCF shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cooperate to hold the TCF Meeting and the Chemical
Meeting on the same day and at the same time as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement, and to set the same record date for each
such meeting.

6.4. Legal Conditions to Merger. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of
this Agreement, each of Chemical and TCF shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal and regulatory requirements that may be imposed on such Party or its
Subsidiaries with 

respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VII, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other Party to obtain)
any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption
by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be
obtained by TCF or Chemical or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5. Stock Exchange Listing. Chemical shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the shares of Chemical Common Stock and the shares of New Chemical
Preferred Stock (or depositary shares in respect thereof) to be issued in the
Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

6.6. Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) Chemical shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to, provide each employee of TCF or Chemical
or any of their respective Subsidiaries who continues employment with Chemical
or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries)
immediately following the Effective Time (collectively, the "Continuing
Employees") for the applicable period specified below (or such shorter period
of time as such Continuing Employee is employed following the Effective Time),
with the following compensation and benefits: (i) during the one-year period
following the Effective Time, (A) a base salary or base wage rate, as
applicable, that is no less favorable than the base salary or base wage rate,
as applicable, provided by Chemical, TCF or any such Subsidiary, as
applicable, to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (B) annual or short-term cash incentive compensation target
opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable than the annual or
short-term cash incentive compensation target opportunities provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided,
however, that with respect to Continuing Employees who are eligible to
participate in the Surviving Corporation's corporate annual incentive plan,
the incentive compensation target opportunities for the first full fiscal year
commencing following the Effective Time shall be based on the target
opportunities and terms and conditions, including performance goals, developed
by the Surviving Corporation with respect to such performance period, applied
on a consistent basis with respect to similarly situated Continuing Employees
who were employed by Chemical and TCF, respectively, as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, (ii) (A) during the period from the Effective Time
through the end of the fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs, other
compensation (excluding long-term incentive opportunities) and employee
benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the other
compensation and employee benefits provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) following the end of the
period set forth in the foregoing clause (A) (but not later than first
anniversary of the Effective Time), other compensation (including long-term
incentive opportunities for those Continuing Employees determined to be
eligible for participation by the Surviving Corporation) and employee benefits
that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the other compensation and
employee benefits under the plans and programs developed by the Surviving
Corporation, which, to the extent permitted by applicable law, among other
things, shall (x) treat similarly situated employees on a substantially
equivalent basis, taking into account all relevant factors, including duties,
geographic location, tenure, qualifications and abilities and (y) 

not discriminate between the Continuing Employees who were covered by Chemical
Benefit Plans, on the one hand, and those covered by TCF Benefit Plans on the
other, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) during the
one-year period following the Effective Time, severance benefits that are no
less favorable than those provided under the applicable TCF Benefit Plan or
Chemical Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee was eligible to
receive severance benefits under immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Chemical or its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) in which any
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate on or after the Effective
Time, including any such plans that were originally Chemical Benefits Plans or
TCF Benefit Plans (the "New Plans"), Chemical shall or shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to:
(i) use reasonable best efforts to waive all pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under
any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions
or waiting periods would apply under the analogous applicable TCF Benefit Plan
or Chemical Benefit Plan, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to provide each
such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee or dependent prior to the Effective Time
under a TCF Benefit Plan or Chemical Benefit Plan (to the same extent that
such credit was given under the analogous applicable TCF Benefit Plan or
Chemical Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any
applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket requirements under any New
Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of such employees with Chemical, TCF
and their respective Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan to the same
extent that such service was taken into account under the analogous applicable
TCF Benefit Plan or Chemical Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time;
provided that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the
extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of
services, (B) for benefit accrual purposes under any employee benefit plan
that is a defined benefit pension or post-retirement welfare plan or (C) for
any purpose under a benefit plan that is frozen and/or applies to a
grandfathered group of participants.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of TCF, Chemical or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of
the Surviving Corporation, TCF, Chemical or any Subsidiary or affiliate
thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the
Surviving Corporation, TCF, Chemical or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to
discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or
consultant of TCF, Chemical or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify
any TCF Benefit Plan, Chemical Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the
ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
to amend, modify or terminate any particular TCF Benefit Plan, Chemical
Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the
generality of Section 9.11, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any person, including, without limitation,
any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of TCF,
Chemical or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement. 

(d) The Parties and following the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation
acknowledge that a "change in control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning
of each Chemical Benefit Plan and TCF Benefit Plan will occur at the Effective
Time; provided that, for purposes of any such plans that provide for deferred
compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, the foregoing
shall not accelerate the time of payment to the Effective Time if payment due
to the occurrence of the Effective Time is not otherwise provided by the terms
of the applicable plan and would result in an impermissible payment for
purposes of Section 409A of the Code. Effective as of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation hereby expressly assumes the TCF Benefit Plans and
Chemical Benefit Plans and agrees to perform the obligations of TCF and
Chemical or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, thereunder in
accordance with the terms and conditions thereof.

6.7. Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, each present and former director, officer or employee of TCF and its
Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (each, a "TCF
Indemnified Party") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in
part out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was a director,
officer or employee of TCF or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at
the request of TCF or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of
another person and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and Chemical and the Surviving
Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred by such TCF Indemnified
Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law; provided that the TCF
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such TCF Indemnified
Party is not entitled to indemnification. The Surviving Corporation shall
reasonably cooperate with the TCF Indemnified Party, and the TCF Indemnified
Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Surviving Corporation in the defense
of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by TCF (provided that Chemical may
substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are
no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims against the
present and former officers and directors of TCF or any of its Subsidiaries
arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an
amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date
hereof by TCF for such insurance (the "Premium Cap"), and if such premiums for
such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in 

the Surviving Corporation's good faith determination, provide the maximum
coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of
the foregoing, Chemical may (and with the prior written consent of Chemical,
TCF may use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the
Effective Time one or more six-year "tail policies" providing equivalent
coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that
the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed
the Premium Cap. If Chemical or TCF purchases such a tail policy, the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain such tail policy in full force and effect
and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

(c) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Chemical and TCF under this
Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified after the Effective Time in a
manner so as to adversely affect any TCF Indemnified Party or any other person
entitled to the benefit of this Section 6.7 without the prior written consent
of the affected TCF Indemnified Party or affected person.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each TCF
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the Surviving
Corporation or any of its successors or assigns will consolidate with or merge
into any other entity and not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of its assets or
deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar transaction, then in
each case to the extent the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7 are not
otherwise transferred and assumed by such successors and assigns by operation
of law or otherwise, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will
expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

6.8. Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the
Parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each Party to this
Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary
action as may be reasonably requested by the Surviving Corporation.

6.9. Advice of Changes. Each of Chemical and TCF (in such capacity, the
"Notifying Party") shall each promptly advise the other Party of any change or
event (i) that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Notifying Party or (ii) which the Notifying Party believes would
or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any
of the Notifying Party's representations, warranties or covenants contained
herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, either individually or
in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition set forth in, if Chemical is
the Notifying Party, Section 7.1 or 7.3, or if TCF is the Notifying Party,
Section 7.1 or 7.2; provided that any failure to give notice in accordance
with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to
constitute a violation of this Section 6.9 or the failure of any condition set
forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach
of this Agreement by the Party failing to give such notice, in each case
unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied. 

6.10. TCF Acquisition Proposals.

(a) TCF agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their officers, directors, agents,
advisors and representatives (collectively, "Representatives") not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to any TCF
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any
person concerning any TCF Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) provide any
confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in
any discussions with, any person relating to any TCF Acquisition Proposal,
except to notify a person that has made or, to the knowledge of TCF, is making
any inquiries with respect to, or is considering making, a TCF Acquisition
Proposal of the existence of the provisions of this Section 6.10(a); provided
that, prior to obtaining the Requisite TCF Vote, in the event TCF receives an
unsolicited bona fide written TCF Acquisition Proposal after the date of this
Agreement and its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving
the advice of its outside counsel and with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors) that such TCF Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would be
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, it may, and may permit its
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives to, furnish or
cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in such
negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors
concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel,
and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that failure to
take such actions would be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties
under applicable law; provided, further, that, prior to providing any
nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing
proviso, TCF shall have provided such information to Chemical and entered into
a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable
to it than the Confidentiality Agreement (an "Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement"), which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such third
party with any exclusive right to negotiate with TCF. TCF will, and will use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other than
Chemical with respect to any TCF Acquisition Proposal. TCF will promptly
(within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Chemical following receipt of any TCF
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead
to a TCF Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the
material terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such
inquiry or TCF Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Chemical reasonably
apprised (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any
amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry or TCF
Acquisition Proposal. TCF shall (A) withdraw and terminate access that was
granted to any person (other than the Parties to this Agreement and their
respective affiliates and Representatives) to any "data room" (virtual or
physical) that was established in connection with a TCF Acquisition Proposal
prior to the date of this Agreement and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to
enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof.
During the term of this Agreement, TCF shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives not to on its behalf, enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other similar agreement
relating to a TCF Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement). As used in this Agreement, "TCF Acquisition
Proposal" shall mean other than the 

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry
relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition
or purchase, direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of
TCF and its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of TCF or of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated assets of TCF, (ii) any
tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 25% or more
of any class of equity or voting securities of TCF or of its Subsidiaries
whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the
consolidated assets of TCF, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving TCF or its Subsidiaries
whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the
consolidated assets of TCF. TCF shall use its reasonable best efforts, subject
to applicable law, to, within ten (10) business days after the date hereof,
request and confirm the return or destruction of any confidential information
provided to any person (other than Chemical and its affiliates) pursuant to
any such confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement. As used in this
Agreement, "TCF Superior Proposal" shall mean a bona fide written TCF
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of TCF concludes in good
faith to be more favorable to its stockholders than the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (i) after receiving the advice of its
financial advisors (who shall be a nationally recognized investment banking
firm), (ii) after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such
transaction on the terms set forth therein and (iii) after taking into account
all legal (with the advice of outside counsel) financial (including the
financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal (including any expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to
closing) and any other relevant factors permitted under applicable law;
provided, that for purposes of the definition of "TCF Superior Proposal," the
reference to "25%" in the definition of TCF Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be references to "a majority."

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent TCF or its Board of
Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to a TCF Acquisition Proposal or
from making any legally required disclosure to TCF's stockholders; provided
that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action
pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

6.11. Chemical Acquisition Proposals.

(a) Chemical agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to any Chemical
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any
person concerning any Chemical Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) provide any
confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in
any discussions with, any person relating to any Chemical Acquisition
Proposal, except to notify a person that has made or, to the knowledge of
Chemical, is making any inquiries with respect to, or is considering making, a
Chemical Acquisition Proposal of the existence of the provisions of this
Section 6.11(a); provided that, prior to obtaining the Requisite Chemical
Vote, in the event Chemical receives an unsolicited bona fide written Chemical
Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement and its Board of
Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that 

such Chemical Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would be reasonably likely
to result in a Superior Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and
its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished
nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or
discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors concludes in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisor) that failure to take such actions
would be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable
law; provided, further, that, prior to providing any nonpublic information
permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, Chemical shall
have provided such information to TCF and entered into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such third party, which confidentiality
agreement shall not provide such third party with any exclusive right to
negotiate with Chemical. Chemical will, and will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the
date of this Agreement with any person other than TCF with respect to any
Chemical Acquisition Proposal. Chemical will promptly (within twenty-four (24)
hours) advise TCF following receipt of any Chemical Acquisition Proposal or
any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to a Chemical
Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the material terms
and conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or
Chemical Acquisition Proposal), and will keep TCF reasonably apprised (and in
any event within twenty-four (24) hours) of any related developments,
discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to
or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry or Chemical Acquisition
Proposal. Chemical shall (A) withdraw and terminate access that was granted to
any person (other than the Parties to this Agreement and their respective
affiliates and Representatives) to any "data room" (virtual or physical) that
was established in connection with a Chemical Acquisition Proposal prior to
the date of this Agreement and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to enforce
any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof. During the
term of this Agreement, Chemical shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and its and their Representatives not to on its behalf, enter into any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or other similar agreement with respect to a
Chemical Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement). As used in this Agreement, "Chemical Acquisition Proposal" shall
mean, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer,
proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of interest in,
(i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the
consolidated assets of Chemical and its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any
class of equity or voting securities of Chemical or of its Subsidiaries whose
assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the
consolidated assets of Chemical, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-
tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such
third party beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of Chemical or of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated assets of Chemical,
or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
transaction involving Chemical or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually
or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated assets of
Chemical. Chemical shall use its reasonable best efforts, subject to
applicable law, to, within ten (10) business days after the date hereof,
request and confirm the return or destruction of any confidential information
provided to any person (other than TCF and its affiliates) pursuant to any
such confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement. As used in 

this Agreement, "Chemical Superior Proposal" shall mean a bona fide written
Chemical Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Chemical
concludes in good faith to be more favorable to its shareholders than the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (i) after receiving the
advice of its financial advisors (who shall be a nationally recognized
investment banking firm), (ii) after taking into account the likelihood of
consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein and (iii)
after taking into account all legal (with the advice of outside counsel)
financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and
other aspects of such proposal (including any expense reimbursement provisions
and conditions to closing) and any other relevant factors permitted under
applicable law; provided, that for purposes of the definition of "Superior
Proposal," the reference to "25%" in the definition of Chemical Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "a majority."

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Chemical or its Board of
Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to a Chemical Acquisition Proposal
or from making any legally required disclosure to Chemical's shareholders;
provided that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that
any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

6.12. Public Announcements. TCF and Chemical shall each use their reasonable
best efforts to develop a joint communications plan to ensure that all press
releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan,
and except in respect of any announcement required by applicable law, or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities
exchange, to consult with each other before issuing any press release or, to
the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.13. Restructuring Efforts. If either TCF or Chemical shall have failed to
obtain the Requisite TCF Vote or the Requisite Chemical Vote at the duly
convened TCF Meeting or Chemical Meeting, as applicable, or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, each of the Parties shall in good faith use its
reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood that neither Party shall
have any obligation to alter or change any material terms, including the
Exchange Ratio, the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to
holders of the capital stock of TCF as provided for in this Agreement, or any
term that would adversely affect the tax treatment of the transactions
contemplated hereby, in a manner adverse to such Party or its shareholders or
stockholders (as applicable)) and/or resubmit this Agreement and/or the
transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section
6.13) to its respective shareholders or stockholders (as applicable) for
approval or adoption (as applicable).

6.14. Takeover Statutes. None of TCF, Chemical or their respective Boards of
Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Statute to
become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary steps to
exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or
hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each Party and the members
of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take
such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and thereby and 

otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if
necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover
Statute.

6.15. Exemption from Liability under Section 16(b). TCF and Chemical agree
that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and
directors of TCF subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act (the "TCF Insiders"), both prior to and after the Effective Time,
it is desirable that TCF Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of TCF Common
Stock, TCF Preferred Stock and TCF Equity Awards in the Merger, and for that
compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section
6.15. The Board of Directors of Chemical and of TCF, or a committee of non-
employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall prior to the Effective Time take all
such steps as may be required to cause (in the case of TCF) any dispositions
of TCF Common Stock, TCF Preferred Stock or TCF Equity Awards by TCF Insiders,
and (in the case of Chemical) any acquisitions of Chemical Common Stock or New
Chemical Preferred Stock by any TCF Insiders who, immediately following the
Merger, will be officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from
liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law.



6.16. Litigation and Claims. Each of Chemical and TCF shall, to the extent
permitted under applicable law and regulation, promptly notify the other Party
in writing of any action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation,
litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued, commenced, brought, conducted or
heard by or before, or otherwise involving, any Governmental Entity or
arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of Chemical or TCF, as applicable,
threatened against Chemical, TCF or any of their respective Subsidiaries that
(a) questions or would reasonably be expected to question the validity of this
Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any
actions taken or to be taken by Chemical, TCF, or their respective
Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or
otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Prior to
the Effective Time, each Party shall give the other Party the opportunity to
participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of any shareholder
litigation against such Party and/or its directors or affiliates relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall
be agreed without the other Party's prior written consent (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld).



6.17. Assumption of TCF Debt. Chemical agrees to execute and deliver, or cause
to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of Chemical, at or prior to the
Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures, guarantees, and other
instruments required for the due assumption of TCF's obligations in respect of
its outstanding debt, guarantees, securities, and other agreements to the
extent required by the terms of such debt, guarantees, securities, and other
agreements.



6.18. Data Conversion. From and after the date hereof, the Parties shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the integration of TCF
with the business of Chemical following consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and plan for
the conversion of the data processing and related electronic information
technology systems (the "Data Conversion"). The Parties agree to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly commence preparations for
implementation of the Data Conversion, with the goal of effecting the Data
Conversion after the Effective Time and at such later time as mutually agreed
upon by the Parties. The Parties agree to cooperate in preparing for the Data
Conversion, including by providing reasonable access to data, information
systems, and personnel having expertise with their and their respective
Subsidiaries' information and data systems; provided, however, that neither
Party shall be required to terminate any third-party service provider
arrangements prior to the Effective Time.

6.19. Corporate Governance.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Chemical shall take all actions necessary to
adopt the by-laws set forth in Exhibit 3 effective as of and from and after
the Effective Time and to effect the requirements referenced therein. The
provisions of Article IX of such by-laws shall also be considered an agreement
of the Parties in this Agreement mutatis mutandis.

(b) On or prior to the Effective Time, (i) Chemical's Board of Directors shall
cause the number of directors that will comprise the full Board of Directors
of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time to be 16, consisting of (A)
the chief executive officer of TCF, the lead director of TCF and six other
current independent directors of TCF designated by TCF, and (B) the chief
executive officer, the chairman of Chemical and six other current independent
directors of Chemical designated by Chemical and (ii) in addition to the
directors then serving on the board of directors of TCF Bank, TCF (as the sole
shareholder of TCF Bank) shall cause the persons indicated in Exhibit 4 to
become and serve as directors of TCF Bank at the Effective Time.

(c) On or prior to the Effective Time, the Chemical Board of Directors shall
take such actions as are necessary to cause the persons indicated in Exhibit 5
to be elected or appointed to the offices of the Surviving Corporation
specified in such Exhibit as of the Effective Time.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the name of the Surviving Corporation
shall be "TCF Financial Corporation."

(e) The headquarters of the Surviving Corporation will be located in Detroit,
Michigan, and following the Effective Time the main office of TCF Bank will be
located in a location to be determined as set forth in Section 6.19(e) of the
TCF Disclosure Schedule.



6.20. Dividends. After the date of this Agreement, each of TCF and Chemical
shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect of
the TCF Common Stock and the Chemical Common Stock and the record dates and
payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the Parties that
holders of TCF Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to
receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of TCF
Common Stock and any shares of Chemical Common Stock any such holder receives
in exchange therefor in the Merger.

either individually or in the aggregate, and without giving effect to any
qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth in such
representations or warranties, has had or would reasonably be expected to have

ARTICLE VIII 
TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

8.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after approval or adoption of this Agreement
by the shareholders of Chemical or the stockholders of TCF (as applicable):

(a) by mutual consent of Chemical and TCF in a written instrument, if the
Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board of Directors; 

(b) by either Chemical or TCF if any Governmental Entity that must grant a
Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the Bank
Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order
permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the
consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger, unless the failure to obtain a
Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the Party seeking
to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements
of such Party set forth herein;

(c) by either Chemical or TCF if the Merger shall not have been consummated on
or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the
"Termination Date"), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date
shall be due to the failure of the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement
to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such Party set forth
herein; provided that if on the Termination Date, the condition set forth in
Section 7.1(c) shall not have been satisfied but all other conditions to
Closing shall have been satisfied or capable of being satisfied, then the
Termination Date may be extended for a period of three months at the option of
either TCF or Chemical by written notice to the other on or prior to the
Termination Date;

(d) by either Chemical or TCF (provided that the terminating Party is not then
in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any
such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this
Agreement on the part of TCF, in the case of a termination by Chemical, or
Chemical, in the case of a termination by TCF, which breach or failure to be
true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such
Party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would
constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by Chemical,
or 7.3, in the case of a termination by TCF, and which is not cured within
forty-five (45) days following written notice to TCF, in the case of a
termination by Chemical, or Chemical, in the case of a termination by TCF, or
by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days
as remain prior to the Termination Date);

(e) by TCF prior to such time as the Requisite Chemical Vote is obtained, if
(i) the Board of Directors of Chemical shall have (A) failed to recommend in
the Joint Proxy Statement that the shareholders of Chemical approve this
Agreement, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation in a manner
adverse to TCF, or publicly disclosed that it has resolved to do so, or failed
to recommend against acceptance of a tender offer or exchange offer
constituting a Chemical Acquisition Proposal that has been publicly disclosed
within ten (10) business days after the commencement of such tender or
exchange offer, in any such case whether or not permitted by the terms hereof
or (B) recommended or endorsed a Chemical Acquisition Proposal or failed to
issue a press release announcing its opposition to such Chemical Acquisition
Proposal within ten (10) business days after a Chemical Acquisition Proposal
is publicly announced or (ii) Chemical or its Board of Directors has breached
its obligations under Section 6.3 or 6.10 in any material respect; or

(f) by Chemical prior to such time as the Requisite TCF Vote is obtained, if
(i) the Board of Directors of TCF shall have (A) failed to recommend in the
Joint Proxy Statement that the stockholders of TCF adopt this Agreement, or
withdrawn, modified or qualified such 

recommendation in a manner adverse to Chemical, or publicly disclosed that it
has resolved to do so, or failed to recommend against acceptance of a tender
offer or exchange offer constituting a TCF Acquisition Proposal that has been
publicly disclosed within ten (10) business days after the commencement of
such tender or exchange offer, in any such case whether or not permitted by
the terms hereof or (B) recommended or endorsed a TCF Acquisition Proposal or
failed to issue a press release announcing its opposition to such TCF
Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) business days after a TCF Acquisition
Proposal is publicly announced, or (ii) TCF or its Board of Directors has
breached its obligations under Section 6.3 or 6.10 in any material respect.

8.2. Effect of Termination.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Chemical or TCF as
provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have
no effect, and none of Chemical, TCF, any of their respective Subsidiaries or
any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of
any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, except that

(i) Sections 6.2(b) and this Section 8.2 and Article IX (other than Section
9.12) shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and

(ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither Chemical nor TCF shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or
damages arising out of fraud or its Willful Breach of any provision of this
Agreement occurring prior to termination (which, in the case of TCF, shall
include the loss to the holders of TCF Capital Stock and TCF Equity Awards of
the economic benefits of the Merger, it being understood that TCF shall be
entitled to pursue damages for such losses and to enforce the right to recover
such losses on behalf of its stockholders and the holders of TCF Equity Awards
in its sole and absolute discretion, and any amounts received by TCF in
connection therewith may be retained by TCF). "Willful Breach" shall mean a
material breach of, or material failure to perform any of the covenants or
other agreements contained in, this Agreement, that is a consequence of an act
or failure to act by the breaching or non-performing Party with actual
knowledge that such Party's act or failure to act would, or would reasonably
be expected to, result in or constitute such breach of or such failure of
performance under this Agreement.

(b) (A) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a bona fide TCF Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made known to senior management or the board of directors of TCF or has
been made directly to its stockholders generally or any person shall have
publicly announced (whether or not conditional) a TCF Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not withdrawn) and (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by
either Chemical or TCF pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without the Requisite TCF
Vote having been obtained or (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by
Chemical pursuant to Section 8.1(d) and (C) prior to the date that is twelve
(12) months after the date of such termination, TCF enters into a definitive
agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to a TCF Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not the same TCF Acquisition Proposal as that referred to
above), then TCF shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such
definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay
Chemical, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to $134,000,000 (the
"Termination 

Fee"); provided that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b), all references in
the definition of TCF Acquisition Proposal to "25%" shall instead refer to
"50%".

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Chemical pursuant to
Section 8.1(f), then TCF shall pay Chemical, by wire transfer of same day
funds, the Termination Fee on the date of termination.

(c) (A) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Chemical Acquisition Proposal shall
have been made known to senior management or the board of directors of
Chemical or has been made directly to its shareholders generally or any person
shall have publicly announced (whether or not conditional) a Chemical
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not withdrawn) and (A) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by either Chemical or TCF pursuant to Section 8.1(c)
without the Requisite Chemical Vote having been obtained or (B) thereafter
this Agreement is terminated by TCF pursuant to Section 8.1(d) and (C) prior
to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination,
Chemical enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with
respect to a Chemical Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Chemical
Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then Chemical shall, on the
earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of
consummation of such transaction, pay TCF, by wire transfer of same day funds,
the Termination Fee; provided that for purposes of this Section 8.2(c), all
references in the definition of Chemical Acquisition Proposal to "25%" shall
instead refer to "50%".

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by TCF pursuant to Section
8.1(e), then Chemical shall pay TCF, by wire transfer of same day funds, the
Termination Fee on the date of termination.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of either Party to recover liabilities or damages arising out of the
other Party's fraud or Willful Breach of any provision of this Agreement, in
the event that this Agreement is terminated as provided in Section 8.1 under
circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable and paid in full, the
maximum aggregate amount of monetary fees, liabilities or damages payable by a
single Party under this Section 8.2 shall be equal to the Termination Fee, and
neither TCF nor Chemical shall be required to pay the Termination Fee on more
than one occasion.

(e) Each of Chemical and TCF acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other Party would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if Chemical or TCF fails promptly to pay the
amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment,
the other Party commences a suit which results in a judgment against the non-
paying Party for the Termination Fee, such non-paying Party shall pay the
costs and expenses of the other Party (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if Chemical or TCF,
as the case may be, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section
8.2, then such Party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts (for the
period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is
actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate (as
announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the
date on which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing
as of the date that such overdue amount was 

originally required to be paid. The amounts payable by Chemical and TCF, as
applicable, pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.2(c), as applicable,
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the case of
fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement, shall be the sole monetary remedy
of TCF and Chemical, as applicable, in the event of a termination of this
Agreement specified in such section under circumstances where the Termination
Fee is payable and is paid in full.

ARTICLE IX

shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of

determine that they lack subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located
in the State of Delaware) (and any courts from which appeals may be taken)
(the "Chosen Courts"), and, solely in connection with claims arising under

be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section 9.5.

9.10. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY

COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AT THE
TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,

LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO

9.11. Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the Parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Party. Any purported assignment in contravention hereof
shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically
provided in Section 6.7, which is intended to benefit each TCF Indemnified
Party and his or her heir and representatives, this Agreement (including the
documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to, and does
not, confer upon any person other than the Parties any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties
set forth herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations between the Parties and are for the sole benefit of
the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance herewith without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation between the Parties
of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any
of the Parties. Consequently, persons other than the Parties may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

9.12. Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parties shall be
entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the
Parties' obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties hereby
further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a
remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post
security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

9.13. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.



9.14. Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission. This Agreement and any
signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement,
and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and
delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by email delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal

5.70% SERIES C NON-CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK

Section 1. Designation. The designation of the series of preferred stock shall
be 5.70% Series C Non‑Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (hereinafter
referred to as the "Series C Preferred Stock"). Each share of Series C
Preferred Stock shall be identical in all respects to every other share of
Series C Preferred Stock. Series C Preferred Stock will rank equally with
Parity Stock, if any, and will rank senior to Junior Stock with respect to the
payment of dividends and the distribution of assets in the event of any
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs
of the Corporation.



Section 2. Number of Shares. The number of authorized shares of Series C
Preferred Stock shall be 8,050. Such number may from time to time be increased
(but not in excess of the total number of authorized shares of preferred
stock) or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Series C Preferred
Stock then outstanding) by further resolution duly adopted by the board of
directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the board of
directors of the Corporation and by the filing of a certificate pursuant to
the provisions of the Michigan Business Corporation Act stating that such
increase or reduction, as the case may be, has been so authorized. All
additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be deemed to form a single
series with the Series C Preferred Stock, provided that any such additional
shares of Series C Preferred Stock are not treated as "disqualified preferred
stock" within the meaning of Section 1059(f)(2) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, and such additional shares of Series C Preferred
Stock are otherwise treated as fungible with the Series C Preferred Stock
authorized under this Section 2 for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The
Corporation shall have the authority to issue fractional shares of Series C
Preferred Stock.



Section 3. Definitions. As used herein with respect to Series C Preferred
Stock:



(a) "Appropriate Federal Banking Agency" means the "appropriate Federal

the Corporation who is not an interested shareholder or an "affiliate" or an
"associate" (as such terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as the same shall be in effect from time to
time) of an interested shareholder and who was a member of the board of
directors immediately prior to the time that an interested shareholder became
an interested shareholder, and any successor to a Continuing Director who is
not an interested shareholder or an affiliate or associate of an interested
shareholder and is recommended to succeed a Continuing Director by a majority
of the Continuing Directors who are then members of the board of directors;

stock of the Corporation hereafter authorized over which Series C Preferred
Stock has preference or priority in the payment of dividends or in the
distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the

that ranks on a parity with Series C Preferred Stock in the payment of

administrative decision or judicial decision, or administrative action, or

Section 4. Dividends.



(a) Rate. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive,
if, as and when declared by the board of directors of the Corporation or any
duly authorized committee of the board of directors of the Corporation, but
only out of assets legally available therefor, non-cumulative cash dividends
on the liquidation preference of $25,000 per share of Series C Preferred
Stock, and no more, payable quarterly in arrears on each March 1, June 1,
September 1 and December 1; provided, however, if any such day is not a
Business Day, then payment of any dividend otherwise payable on that date will
be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (without any
interest or other payment in respect of such delay) (each such day on which
dividends are payable a "Dividend Payment Date"), commencing with the first
such Dividend Payment Date to occur after the Closing Date. The period from
and including the date of issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock or any
Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date is a
"Dividend Period." Dividends on each share of Series C Preferred Stock will
accrue on the liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share at a rate per
annum equal to 5.70%. The record date for payment of dividends on the Series C
Preferred Stock shall be the 15th day of the calendar month immediately
preceding the month during which the Dividend Payment Date falls. The amount
of dividends payable shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months. Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock shall not be declared, paid
or set aside for payment to the extent such act would cause the Corporation to
fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable thereto, including
applicable capital adequacy guidelines.



(b) Non-Cumulative Dividends. Dividends on shares of Series C Preferred Stock
shall be non-cumulative. To the extent that any dividends payable on the
shares of Series C Preferred Stock on any Dividend Payment Date are not
declared and paid, in full or otherwise, on such Dividend Payment Date, then
such unpaid dividends shall not cumulate and shall cease to accrue and be
payable and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay, and the holders
of Series C Preferred Stock shall have no right to receive, dividends accrued
for such Dividend Period after the Dividend Payment Date for such Dividend
Period or interest with respect to such dividends, whether or not dividends
are declared for any subsequent Dividend Period with respect to Series C
Preferred 



Stock, any Parity Stock, any Junior Stock or any other class or series of
authorized preferred stock of the Corporation.



(c) Priority of Dividends. So long as any share of Series C Preferred Stock
remains outstanding, unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of Series
C Preferred Stock for the then-current Dividend Period have been declared and
paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been
set aside, (i) no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment
and no distribution shall be declared or made or set aside for payment on any
Junior Stock, other than a dividend payable solely in Junior Stock, (ii) no
shares of Junior Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired
for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly (other than as a
result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into other Junior Stock,
or the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another
share of Junior Stock, and other than through the use of the proceeds of a
substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Stock), nor shall
any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption
of any such securities by the Corporation and (iii) no shares of Parity Stock
shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the
Corporation otherwise than pursuant to pro rata offers to purchase all, or a
pro rata portion, of the Series C Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock except
by conversion into or exchange for Junior Stock, during such dividend period.
When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series C Preferred
Stock and any Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Series C
Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock shall be declared on a proportional basis
so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the
same ratio that accrued dividends for the then‑current Dividend Period per
share on Series C Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, including any
accumulation, on any Parity Stock, bear to each other. No interest will be
payable in respect of any dividend payment on shares of Series C Preferred
Stock that may be in arrears. If the board of directors of the Corporation or
any duly authorized committee of the board of directors of the Corporation
determines not to pay any dividend or a full dividend on a Dividend Payment
Date, the Corporation will provide, or cause to be provided, written notice to
the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock prior to such date. Subject to the
foregoing, and not otherwise, dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise)
as may be determined by the board of directors of the Corporation or any duly
authorized committee of the board of directors of the Corporation may be
declared and paid on any Junior Stock from time to time out of any assets
legally available therefor, and the shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall
not be entitled to participate in any such dividend.



Section 5. Liquidation Rights.



(a) Liquidation. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, holders of Series
C Preferred Stock shall be entitled, out of assets legally available therefor,
before any distribution or payment out of the assets of the Corporation may be
made to or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock and subject to the
rights of any holders of any class or series of securities ranking senior to
or on parity with Series C Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of
the Corporation's depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a
liquidating distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of
$25,000 per share, plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends, without
accumulation of any undeclared dividends, to the date of liquidation. Holders
of Series C Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to 



any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation other
than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5.



(b) Partial Payment. If the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient to
pay in full the liquidation preference plus any authorized, declared and
unpaid dividends to all holders of Series C Preferred Stock and all holders of
any Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series C Preferred Stock
and to the holders of all Parity Stock shall be paid pro rata in accordance
with the respective amounts that would be payable on such shares if all
amounts payable thereon were paid in full.



(c) Residual Distributions. If the liquidation preference plus any authorized,
declared and unpaid dividends has been paid in full to all holders of Series C
Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock will not be
entitled to any further participation in any distribution of assets by the
Corporation.



(d) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of
this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares
of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of
the property and assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed a voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the
Corporation, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business
combination transaction of the Corporation into or with any other corporation
or person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination
transaction of any other corporation or person into or with the Corporation be
deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up
of the affairs of the Corporation.



Section 6. Redemption.



(a) Optional Redemption. The Corporation, at the option of its board of
directors or any duly authorized committee of the board of directors of the
Corporation, may redeem in whole or in part the shares of Series C Preferred
Stock at the time outstanding, at any time on December 1, 2022 or any Dividend
Payment Date thereafter, upon notice given as provided in Section 6(b) below.
The redemption price for shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be $25,000
per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends for prior Dividend Periods,
without accumulation of undeclared dividends (the "Redemption Price").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, within 90 days following the occurrence of a
Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, the Corporation may, at its option,
subject to the approval of the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency, provide
notice of its intent to redeem as provided in Section 6(b) below, and
subsequently redeem, all (but not less than all) of the shares of Series C
Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, at the Redemption Price applicable on
such date of redemption.



(b) Notice of Redemption. Notice of every redemption of shares of Series C
Preferred Stock shall be either (i) mailed by first class mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of such shares to be redeemed at
their respective last addresses appearing on the stock register of the
Corporation or (ii) transmitted by such other method approved by the
Depositary Trust Company, in its reasonable discretion, to the holders of
record of such shares to be redeemed. Such 



mailing or transmittal shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days
before the date fixed for redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Series C Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through DTC, the
Corporation may give such notice in any manner permitted by DTC. Any notice
mailed or transmitted as provided in this Section 6(b) shall be conclusively
presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such
notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail or other transmission, or
any defect in such notice or in the mailing or transmittal thereof, to any
holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall
not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other
shares of Series C Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state (i) the redemption
date; (ii) the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed
and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the
number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the Redemption
Price; (iv) the place or places where the certificates for such shares are to
be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price; and (v) that dividends on
the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date.



(c) Partial Redemption. In case of any redemption of only part of the shares
of Series C Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series C
Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected either pro rata from the
holders of record of Series C Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of
shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by such holders or in such other
manner consistent with the rules and policies of the NASDAQ as the board of
directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the board of
directors of the Corporation may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject
to the provisions of this Section 6, the board of directors of the Corporation
or any duly authorized committee of the board of directors shall have full
power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of
Series C Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time.



(d) Effectiveness of Redemption. If notice of redemption has been duly given
and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds
necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corporation, separate
and apart from its other assets, in trust for the pro rata benefit of the
holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be
available therefor, or deposited by the Corporation with a bank or trust
company selected by the board of directors of the Corporation or any duly
authorized committee of the board of directors (the "Depositary Company") in
trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the shares called for
redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called
for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the
redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be
outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue
after such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall
forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right
of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from
such bank or trust company at any time after the redemption date from the
funds so deposited, without interest. The Corporation shall be entitled to
receive, from time to time, from the Depositary Company any interest accrued
on such funds, and the holders of any shares called for redemption shall have
no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end
of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law,
be released or repaid to the Corporation, and in the event of such repayment
to the Corporation, the holders of record of the shares so called for
redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Corporation for an
amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated 



above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Corporation, but
shall in no event be entitled to any interest.



Section 7. Voting Rights. The holders of Series C Preferred Stock will have no
voting rights and will not be entitled to elect any directors, except as
expressly provided by law and except that:



(a) Supermajority Voting Rights-Amendments. Unless the vote or consent of the
holders of a greater number of shares shall then be required by law, the
affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 662/3% of all of the
shares of the Series C Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, voting
separately as a class, shall be required to authorize any amendment of the
Articles of Incorporation or of any certificate amendatory thereof or
supplemental thereto (including any certificate of designations or any similar
document relating to any series of preferred stock) which will materially and
adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series C
Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; provided, however, that the following will
not be deemed to adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or
rights of the Series C Preferred Stock: (i) any increase in the amount of the
authorized or issued Series C Preferred Stock, (ii) any increase in the amount
of authorized preferred stock of the Corporation, or (iii) the creation and
issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series
of preferred stock ranking equally with and/or junior to the Series C
Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such
dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and/or the distribution of assets
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.



(b) Supermajority Voting Rights-Priority. Unless the vote or consent of the
holders of a greater number of shares shall then be required by law, the
affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 662/3% of all of the
shares of the Series C Preferred Stock and all other Parity Stock, at the time
outstanding, voting as a single class without regard to series, shall be
required to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or to issue
or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the
right to purchase, any additional class or series of stock ranking prior to
the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock and all other Parity Stock as to
dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation.



(c) Special Voting Right.



(i) Voting Right. If and whenever dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock or
any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the
Series C Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, and upon which voting
rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(c) have been conferred
and are exercisable, have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to
any class or series, to at least six quarterly Dividend Periods (whether
consecutive or not), the number of directors constituting the board of
directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two, and the holders of the
Series C Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the
Corporation's authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights,
whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote
for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist),
shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to
series, to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two
directors of the Corporation to fill 



such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of
such directorships), provided that the board of directors of the Corporation
shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director
elected by the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock and any other
class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Series C
Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends is a "Preferred Director."



(ii) Election. The election of the Preferred Directors will take place at any
annual meeting of shareholders or any special meeting of the holders of Series
C Preferred Stock and any other class or series of the Corporation's stock
that ranks on parity with Series C Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends
and for which dividends have not been paid, called as provided herein. At any
time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(c)(i)
above, a majority of the Continuing Directors may, and within 20 days after
the written request of any holder of Series C Preferred Stock (addressed to
the Continuing Directors at the Corporation's principal office) must (unless
such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next
annual or special meeting of the shareholders, in which event such election
shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of shareholders), call a
special meeting of the holders of Series C Preferred Stock, and any other
class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series C
Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and for which dividends have not
been paid, for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as
provided in Section 7(c)(iii) below. The Preferred Directors shall each be
entitled to one vote per director on any matter.



(iii) Notice for Special Meeting. Notice for a special meeting will be given
in a similar manner to that provided in the Corporation's bylaws for a special
meeting of the shareholders. The Preferred Directors elected at any such
special meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of the
Corporation's shareholders unless they have been previously terminated or
removed pursuant to Section 7(c)(iv). In case any vacancy in the office of a
Preferred Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the
Preferred Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the
Preferred Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a
vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock
(together with holders of any other class of the Corporation's authorized
preferred stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of
such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors
if such default in dividends did not exist) to serve until the next annual
meeting of the shareholders.



(iv) Termination; Removal. Whenever full dividends have been paid regularly on
the Series C Preferred Stock and any other class or series of preferred stock
that ranks on parity with Series C Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends,
if any, for at least four consecutive Dividend Periods, then the right of the
holders of Series C Preferred Stock to elect such additional two directors
will cease (subject to the same provisions for the vesting of the special
voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect
of future Dividend Periods) and the term of office of each Preferred Director
so elected will immediately terminate and the number of directors constituting
the Corporation's board of directors will be automatically reduced
accordingly. Any Preferred Director may be removed at any time without cause
by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares 



of Series C Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the
Corporation's authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights,
whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote
for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) when
they have the voting rights described in this Section 7(c).



(d) Changes after Provision for Redemption. No vote or consent of the holders
of Series C Preferred Stock shall be required pursuant to Section 7(a), (b) or
(c) above if, at or prior to the time when any such vote or consent would
otherwise be required pursuant to such section, all outstanding Series C
Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed, or notice of redemption has been
given and sufficient funds shall have been irrevocably deposited in trust to
effect such redemption.



Section 8. Conversion. The holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall not have
any rights to convert such Series C Preferred Stock into shares of any other
class of capital stock of the Corporation.



Section 9. Rank. Notwithstanding anything set forth in the Articles of
Incorporation or this Certificate of Designations to the contrary, the board
of directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the board
of directors of the Corporation, without the vote of the holders of the Series
C Preferred Stock, may authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock,
Parity Stock or, subject to the voting rights granted in Section 7, any class
of securities ranking senior to the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends
and the distribution of assets upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.



Section 10. Repurchase. Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the
Corporation may purchase and sell Series C Preferred Stock from time to time
to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the board of directors
of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee of the board of directors
of the Corporation may determine; provided, however, that the Corporation
shall not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are reasonable
grounds to believe that the Corporation is, or by such purchase would be,
rendered insolvent.



Section 11. Unissued or Reacquired Shares. Shares of Series C Preferred Stock
not issued or which have been issued, redeemed or otherwise purchased or
acquired by the Corporation shall be restored to the status of authorized but
unissued shares of preferred stock without designation as to series.



Section 12. No Sinking Fund. Shares of Series C Preferred Stock are not
subject to the operation of a sinking fund.

Article III of Chemical Financial Corporation's Restated Articles of
Incorporation, as amended, is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the
following: 

 

ARTICLE III



The total authorized capital stock of the Corporation is 222,000,000 shares of
stock divided into two classes, as follows:



A. 220,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share; and



B. 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value.



The following provisions apply to the authorized capital stock of the
corporation:

1. Provisions Applicable to Common Stock.

(a)No Preference. None of the shares of common stock are entitled to any
preferences, and each share of common stock is equal to every other share of
common stock in every respect.

(b)Dividends. After payment or declaration of full dividends on all shares
having a priority over the common stock as to dividends, and after making all
required sinking or retirement fund payments, if any, on all classes of
preferred stock and on any other stock of the corporation ranking with
priority as to dividends or assets over the common stock, dividends on the
shares of common stock may be declared and paid, but only when and as
determined by the board of directors. 



(c)Rights on Liquidation. On any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
affairs of the corporation, after payment or setting aside of the full
preferential amounts to which holders of all shares having priority over the
common stock are entitled, the holders of the common stock will be entitled to
receive pro rata all the remaining assets of the corporation available for
distribution to shareholders. The board of directors may distribute in kind to
the holders of common stock the remaining assets of the corporation or may
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the remaining assets
to any person and may sell all or any part of the consideration so received
and distribute any balance thereof in kind to holders of common stock. The
merger or consolidation of the corporation into or with any other corporation,
or the merger or consolidation of any other corporation into it, or any
purchase or redemption of shares of stock of the corporation of any class,
will not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the
corporation for the purposes of this paragraph.

(d)Voting. At all meetings of shareholders of the corporation, the holders of
the common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held
by them respectively.

2. Provisions Applicable To Preferred Stock.

(a)Provisions to be Fixed by the Board of Directors. The board of directors is
expressly authorized at any time, and from time to time, to provide for the
issuance of shares of preferred stock in one or more series, each having the
designations and relative voting, distribution, dividend, liquidation, and
other rights, preferences, and limitations, consistent with the Michigan
Business Corporation Act, as amended, as are stated in the resolution or
resolutions providing for the issuance of shares of preferred stock adopted by
the board of directors, and as are not stated in these Restated Articles of
Incorporation, or any amendments thereto, including (without limiting the
generality of the foregoing) the following:

(1) The distinctive designation and number of shares comprising the series,
which number may (except where otherwise provided by the board of directors in
creating the series) be increased or decreased (but not below the number of
shares then issued and outstanding) from time to time by action of the board
of directors.



(2) The stated value of the shares of the series.



(3) The dividend rate or rates on the shares of the series and the relation
which dividends will bear to the dividends payable on any other class of
capital stock or on any other series of preferred stock, the terms and
conditions upon which and the periods in respect of which dividends will be
payable, whether and upon what conditions dividends will be cumulative and, if

shares, and the designation of the series, if any, which the certificate
represents; 



the par value of each share represented by the certificate, or a statement

person in whose name any share of stock is registered as the owner thereof for
purposes of dividends and other distributions in the course of business, or in
the course of recapitalization, consolidation, merger, reorganization, sale of
assets, liquidation or otherwise and for the purpose of votes, approvals and

SHAREHOLDERS AND MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS



4.01 PLACE OF MEETINGS. All meetings of shareholders shall be held at the
principal office of the corporation or at such other place as shall be
determined by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of meeting.



4.02 ANNUAL MEETING. The annual meeting of the shareholders of the corporation
shall be held on the third Monday of the fourth calendar month after the end
of the corporation's fiscal year at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, or on such
other date and time as shall be determined by the Board of Directors prior to
the end of the second calendar quarter. Directors shall be elected at each
annual meeting and such other business transacted as may come before the
meeting.



4.03 SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of shareholders may be called by the
Board of Directors, the Chair of the Board (if such office is filled) or the
President and shall be called by the President or Secretary at the written
request of shareholders holding a majority of the shares of stock of the
corporation outstanding and entitled to vote. The request shall state the
purpose or purposes for which the meeting is to be called.



4.04 NOTICE OF MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in these Bylaws (including Article VI, Section 6.01), written notice
of each meeting of shareholders, stating 



the time, place, if any, and purposes thereof, shall be given to each
shareholder entitled to vote at the meeting not less than ten nor more than
sixty days before the date fixed for the meeting, either personally, by mail,
or, if authorized by the Board of Directors, by a form of electronic
transmission to which the shareholder has consented. For the purposes of these
Bylaws, "electronic transmission" means any form of communication that does
not directly involve the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record
that may be retained and retrieved by the recipient, and that may be
reproduced in paper form by the recipient through an automated process. Notice
of a meeting need not be given to any shareholder who signs a waiver of notice
before or after the meeting. Attendance of a shareholder at a meeting shall
constitute both: (a) a waiver of notice or defective notice except when the
shareholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the
beginning of the meeting, to holding the meeting or transacting any business
because the meeting has not been lawfully called or convened, and (b) a waiver
of objection to consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is
not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, except
when the shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented.



4.05 RECORD DATES. The Board of Directors, the Chair of the Board (if such
office is filled) or the President may fix in advance a date as the record
date for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of and to
vote at a meeting of shareholders or an adjournment thereof, or to express
consent or to dissent from a proposal without a meeting, or for the purpose of
determining shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend or
allotment of a right, or for the purpose of any other action. The date fixed
shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of the
meeting, nor more than 60 days before any other action. In such case only such
shareholder as shall be shareholders of record on the date so fixed shall be
entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting or adjournment therefor, or
to express consent or to dissent from such proposal, or to receive payment of
such dividend or to receive such allotment of rights, or to participate in any
other action, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on
the books of the corporation, or otherwise, after any such record date.
Nothing in this Bylaw shall affect the rights of a shareholder and his or her
transferee or transferor as between themselves.



4.06 LIST OF SHAREHOLDERS. The Secretary of the corporation or the agent of
the corporation having charge of the stock transfer records for shares of the
corporation shall make and certify a complete list of the shareholders
entitled to vote at a shareholders' meeting or any adjournment thereof. The
list shall be arranged alphabetically within each class and series, with the
address of, and the number of shares held by, each shareholder; be produced at
the time and place of the meeting; be subject to inspection by any shareholder
during the whole time of the meeting; and be prima facie evidence as to who
are the shareholders entitled to examine the list or vote at the meeting.



4.07 QUORUM. Unless a greater or lesser quorum is required in the Articles of
Incorporation or by the laws of the State of Michigan, the shareholders
present at a meeting in person or by proxy who, as of the record date for such
meeting, were holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the
corporation entitled to vote at the meeting shall constitute a quorum at the
meeting. Whether or not a quorum is present, a meeting of shareholders may be
adjourned by a vote of the shares present in person or by proxy. When the
holders of a class or series of shares are entitled to vote separately on an
item of business, this Bylaw applies in determining the presence of a quorum
of such class or series for transaction of such item of business.



4.08 PROXIES. A shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders or
to express consent or dissent without a meeting may authorize one or more
other persons to act for him or her by proxy. The following methods constitute
a valid means by which a shareholder may grant authority to another person to
act as proxy: (a) the execution of a writing authorizing another person or
persons to act for the shareholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by
the shareholder or by an authorized officer, director, employee, or agent
signing the writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to the
writing by any reasonable 



means including, but not limited to, facsimile signature; and (b) transmitting
or authorizing the transmission by electronic transmission to the person who
will hold the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service
organization, or similar agent fully authorized by the person who will hold
the proxy to receive that transmission. Any electronic transmission must
either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be
determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the shareholder.
If an electronic transmission is determined to be valid, the inspectors, or,
if there are no inspectors, the persons making the determination shall specify
the information upon which they relied.



4.09 INSPECTORS OF ELECTION. The Board of Directors, in advance of a
shareholders' meeting, may appoint one or more inspectors to act at the
meeting or any adjournment thereof. If inspectors are not so appointed, the
person presiding at the shareholders' meeting may, and on request of a
shareholder entitled to vote thereat shall, appoint one or more inspectors. In
case a person appointed fails to appear or act, the vacancy may be filled by
appointment made by the Board of Directors in advance of the meeting or at the
meeting by the person presiding thereat. If appointed, the inspectors shall
determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the
shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum and the validity
and effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and
determine challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to
vote, count and tabulate votes, ballots or consents, determine the result, and
do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to
all shareholders. On request of the person presiding at the meeting or a
shareholder entitled to vote thereat, the inspectors shall make and execute a
written report to the person presiding at the meeting of any of the facts
found by them and matters determined by them. The report shall be prima facie
evidence of the facts stated and of the vote as certified by the inspectors.



4.10 VOTING. Each outstanding share is entitled to one vote on each matter
submitted to a vote, unless otherwise provided in the Articles of
Incorporation. Votes shall be cast in writing, signed by the shareholder or
his or her proxy. When an action, other than the election of directors, is to
be taken by a vote of the shareholders, it shall be authorized by a majority
of the votes cast by the holders of shares entitled to vote thereon, unless a
greater plurality is required by the Articles of Incorporation or by the laws
of the State of Michigan. Except as otherwise provided by the Articles of
Incorporation, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at
any election.



4.11 SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the
corporation's Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws:



(a)No matter may be presented for shareholder action at an annual or special
meeting of shareholders unless such matter is: (i) specified in the notice of

of an annual meeting (unless the corporation did not hold an annual meeting
within the last year, or if the date of the upcoming 



annual meeting changed by more than thirty days from the date of the last
preceding meeting, then the notice must be delivered or mailed and received
not more than ten days after the earlier of the date of the notice of the
meeting or public disclosure of the date of the meeting), and not more than
ten days after the earlier of the date of the notice of the meeting or public
disclosure of the date of the meeting in the case of a special meeting. The
notice by the shareholder must set forth: (i) a brief description of the
matter the shareholder desires to present for shareholder action; (ii) the
name and record address of the shareholder proposing the matter for
shareholder action; (iii) the class and number of shares of capital stock of
the corporation that are beneficially owned by the shareholder; and (iv) any
material interest of the shareholder in the matter proposed for shareholder

Section 4.11 is not made available at the time of mailing, the notice of the
purposes of the meeting shall include the name and address of and the number
of shares of the voting security held by the proponent of each shareholder
proposal

officer or as the chairman of the meeting.

NOTICES, WAIVERS OF NOTICE AND MANNER OF ACTING



6.01 NOTICES. All notices of meetings required to be given to shareholders,
