 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (together with all exhibits and schedules,
this "Agreement") is entered into as of February 17, 2020, by and between
Nicolet Bankshares, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation ("Nicolet"), and Commerce
Financial Holdings, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (the "Company").

RECITALS

A. The parties to this Agreement desire to effect a merger of the Company with
and into Nicolet (the "Merger") in accordance with this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the WBCL, with Nicolet as the surviving entity in the
Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Entity").

B. The respective boards of directors of the Company and Nicolet have approved
the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and,
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the WBCL, approved and
declared the advisability of this Agreement and determined that consummation
of the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement is in the best
interests of their respective companies and shareholders.

C. The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" under the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and that this Agreement be and hereby is adopted as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

D. The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the parties also agree to certain
prescribed conditions to the Merger and other transactions.

AGREEMENTS

In consideration of the foregoing premises and the following mutual promises,
covenants and agreements, the parties hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the WBCL, at the
Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into Nicolet pursuant to
the provisions of, and with the effects provided in, the WBCL, the separate
corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Nicolet will be the
Surviving Entity.

Section 1.2 Effective Time; Closing.

(a)The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall occur through the mail or
at a place that is mutually acceptable to Nicolet and the Company, or if they
fail to agree, at the offices of Reinhart Boerner Van Deuren s.c., 1000 North
Water Street, Suite 1700, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202, at 10:00 a.m., local
time, on the date that is five (5) Business Days after the satisfaction or
waiver (subject to applicable Legal Requirements) of the latest to occur of
the conditions set forth in Article 8 and Article 9 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) or at such
other time and place as Nicolet and the Company may agree in writing (the
"Closing Date"). Subject to the provisions of Article 10, failure to
consummate the Merger on the date and time and at the place determined
pursuant to this Section 1.2 will not result in the termination of this
Agreement and will not relieve any party of any obligation under this
Agreement. (b)The parties hereto agree to file on the Closing Date articles of merger
with the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions (the "Articles of
Merger"). The Merger shall become effective as of the date and time specified
in the Articles of Merger (the "Effective Time").

Section 1.3 Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effects of the
Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and the
applicable provisions of the WBCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company shall be vested in the Surviving Entity,
and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Entity.

Section 1.4 Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity. The Nicolet
Articles of Incorporation and the Nicolet Bylaws, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and applicable Legal Requirements.

Section 1.5 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Entity. At the Effective
Time, the directors shall be the directors of Nicolet immediately prior to the
Effective Time and one (1) person from the Company Board, to be designated by
the Company and reasonably acceptable to Nicolet prior to the Effective Time
(such person from the Company Board is expected to be Joseph Fazio, III) (the
"Company Director"). At the Effective Time, the executive officers of the
Surviving Entity shall be the executive officers of Nicolet immediately prior
to the Effective Time. Such directors and executive officers shall serve until
their resignation, removal or until their successors shall have been elected
or appointed and shall have qualified in accordance with the laws and
governing documents applicable to Nicolet or Nicolet Bank.

Section 1.6 Location of the Surviving Entity. The principal offices of the
Surviving Entity will be located at 111 N. Washington Street, Green Bay,
Wisconsin 54301.

Section 1.7 Bank Merger. Following the Effective Time of the Merger, the Bank
shall be merged with and into Nicolet Bank in accordance with the provisions
of the National Bank Act (12 U.S.C. § 215a), Section 18(c) of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act and Subchapter VII of the Wisconsin Banking Law and
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Plan of Merger by and between
Nicolet Bank and the Bank, a form of which is attached as Exhibit A (the "Bank
Plan of Merger"). Following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company will cause the Bank, and Nicolet will cause Nicolet Bank, to execute
and deliver the Bank Plan of Merger substantially in the form set forth in
Exhibit A.

Section 1.8 Absence of Control. Subject to any specific provisions of this
Agreement, it is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that neither
Nicolet nor the Company by reason of this Agreement shall be deemed (until
consummation of the Merger) to control, directly or indirectly, the other
party or any of its respective Subsidiaries and shall not exercise, or be
deemed to exercise, directly or indirectly, a controlling influence over the
management or policies of such other party or any of its respective
Subsidiaries.

Section 1.9 Alternative Structure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, before the Effective Time, Nicolet may change the
method of effecting the Contemplated Transactions if and to the extent that it
concludes such a change to be desirable; provided, that: (a) any such change
shall not affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to
holders of Company Common Stock; and (b) no such change shall (i) alter or
change the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of
Company Common Stock as consideration in the Merger or (ii) materially impede
or delay consummation of the Merger. If Nicolet elects to make such a change,
the parties shall execute appropriate documents to reflect the change.

ARTICLE 2

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

Section 2.1 Consideration. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Nicolet, the Company, or the holder of any
shares of Company Common Stock, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted,
subject to the maximum Nicolet Common Stock issuance procedures in Section
2.3, the fractional share procedures in Section 2.5, the dissenters rights provisions in Section 2.6 and the cash consideration
provisions for shares held in the Company 401(k) Plan in Section 2.9, into the
right to receive:

(i)1.15 fully paid and nonassessable shares (subject to any adjustment in
Section 2.1(ii) or (iii), the "Exchange Ratio") of Nicolet Common Stock (the
"Per Share Stock Consideration");

(ii)If the Nicolet Common Stock Price is greater than $82.00 per share, the
adjusted Exchange Ratio shall equal the quotient (rounded to the nearest
thousandth of a share) obtained by dividing $94.30 by the Nicolet Common Stock
Price;

(iii)If the Nicolet Common Stock Price is less than $62.00 per share, Nicolet
shall have the option to: (a) increase the number of shares of Nicolet Common
Stock to be contributed using an adjusted Exchange Ratio equal to the quotient
(rounded to the nearest Thousandth of a share) obtained by dividing $71.30 by
the Nicolet Common Stock Price subject to the limitations set forth in Section
2.3; (b) leave the Exchange Ratio unchanged, but add additional cash
consideration in an amount sufficient to bring the Per Share Stock
Consideration up to $71.30 per share; (c) leave the Exchange Ratio unchanged,
or (d) terminate this Agreement. Likewise, if Nicolet fails to add additional
stock or cash consideration as set forth in (a) and (b) of the preceding
sentence, or if Nicolet elects to leave the Exchange Ratio unchanged as set
forth in (c) of the preceding sentence, the Company shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement.

The total stock consideration to be paid by Nicolet in respect of shares of
Company Common Stock is referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration."
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.1 to the contrary, at the Effective
Time and by virtue of the Merger, each share of Company Common Stock held in
the Company's treasury and each share of Company Common Stock owned directly
or indirectly by Nicolet (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in
connection with debts previously contracted) will be cancelled and no shares
of Nicolet Common Stock, cash, or other consideration will be issued or paid
in exchange therefor.

Section 2.2 Exchange of Company Stock Certificates.

(a)The parties to this Agreement agree: (i) that Computershare Trust Company,
N.A. shall serve, pursuant to customary terms of an exchange agent agreement,
as the exchange agent for purposes of this Agreement (the "Exchange Agent");
and (ii) to execute and deliver the exchange agent agreement at or prior to
the Effective Time. Nicolet shall be solely responsible for the payment of any
fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent.

(b)At or prior to the Effective Time, Nicolet shall authorize the issuance of
and shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders
of Company Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this Article 2: (i) a
sufficient number of shares of Nicolet Common Stock for payment of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, and (ii) sufficient cash for payment of
(A) Supplemental Cash Consideration in accordance with Section 2.3, if any,
(B) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Nicolet Common Stock in
accordance with Section 2.5, and (C) cash for shares held in the Company
401(k) Plan in accordance with Section 2.9. Such amount of cash in lieu of
fractional shares and shares of Nicolet Common Stock, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto paid after the Effective Time,
are referred to in this Article 2 as the "Conversion Fund."

(c)Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, Nicolet shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more
certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company Stock
Certificates") the letter of transmittal and other appropriate and customary
transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent)
(the "Letter of Transmittal" ) for use in effecting the surrender of Company
Stock Certificates pursuant to this Agreement. (d)Upon proper surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for exchange to the
Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and duly executed Letter of
Transmittal, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor his, her or its Merger Consideration plus cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of Nicolet Common Stock in accordance with
Section 2.2 deliverable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Company Stock Certificate; thereupon such Company Stock
Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled.

(e)No interest will be paid or accrued on any portion of the Merger
Consideration deliverable upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate.

(f)After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers of Outstanding
Company Shares on the stock transfer books of the Company.

(g)No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Nicolet Common
Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate
until the holder thereof shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate in
accordance with this Article 2. Promptly after the surrender of a Company
Stock Certificate in accordance with this Article 2, the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions,
without interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to
shares of Nicolet Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Company Stock Certificate were converted at the Effective
Time pursuant to Section 2.1. No holder of an unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate shall be entitled, until the surrender of such Company Stock
Certificate, to vote the shares of Nicolet Common Stock into which such
holder's Company Common Stock shall have been converted.

(h)Any portion of the Conversion Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the Surviving Entity, or its successors in interest. Any
shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity, or its
successors in interest, for issuance of Nicolet Common stock pursuant to the
Merger Consideration and the payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares
deliverable in respect of such shareholders' shares of Company Common Stock,
as well as any accrued and unpaid dividends or distributions on shares of such
Nicolet Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former
holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good
faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar laws.

(i)In the event any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Company Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, and in accordance with
this Article 2, shares of Nicolet Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

(j)If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Nicolet Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or into a different class by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration per share shall be adjusted
appropriately to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

Section 2.3 Maximum Nicolet Common Stock Issuance. Notwithstanding anything in
this Article 2 to the contrary, under no circumstances shall the number of
shares of Nicolet Common Stock to be issued as a result of the Contemplated
Transactions exceed 19.9% of the outstanding shares of Nicolet Common Stock,
such that the provisions of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635 and/or the WBCL would
require approval of the Contemplated Transactions by the shareholders of
Nicolet. To the extent necessary to avoid a shareholder vote under Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5635 and/or the WBCL, the Exchange Ratio shall be reduced to the
maximum exchange ratio (rounded to the nearest Thousandth of a share) that
would not cause need for a Nicolet shareholder vote, and Nicolet shall add
additional cash consideration (the "Supplemental Cash Consideration") in an amount sufficient
to leave the value of the Per Share Stock Consideration unchanged as a result
of such adjustment.

Section 2.4 Cancellation of Shares. At the Effective Time, the shares of
Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be
cancelled and will cease to exist. Company Stock Certificates that represented
Company Common Stock before the Effective Time will be deemed for all purposes
to represent the number of shares of Nicolet Common Stock or cash into which
they were converted pursuant to this Article 2.

Section 2.5 No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Nicolet Common Stock
shall be issued as Merger Consideration in the Merger. Each holder of Company
Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of
Nicolet Common Stock pursuant to this Article 2 shall instead be entitled to
receive an amount in cash (without interest) rounded to the nearest whole
cent, determined by multiplying Nicolet Common Stock Price by the fractional
share of Nicolet Common Stock to which such former holder would otherwise be
entitled.

Section 2.6 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Article 2 to
the contrary, no Dissenting Shares shall be converted in the Merger. All
dissenting shares shall be cancelled, and the holders thereof shall thereafter
be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Subchapter XIII of the WBCL;
provided, however, that if any such shareholder fails to perfect his, her or
its rights as a dissenting shareholder with respect to his, her or its
Dissenting Shares in accordance with Subchapter XIII of the WBCL or withdraws
or loses such holder's dissenter's rights, such shares held by such
shareholder shall be deemed to have been converted into, and become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to which the holder of such shares would have been entitled as
of the Effective Time, without interest thereon.

Section 2.7 Nicolet Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Nicolet, the Company, or the
holder of any shares of Nicolet Common Stock, the shares of Nicolet Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

Section 2.8 Company Stock Options.

(a)Except as set forth in Section 2.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedules,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, shall be cancelled, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, in consideration for the right to receive,
as promptly as practicable (but no later than fifteen (15) calendar days)
following the Effective Time, a cash payment (without interest and less
applicable withholding Taxes) with respect thereto equal to the product of (i)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of
the product of (x) the Nicolet Common Stock Price and (y) the Exchange Ratio,
subject to any adjustment, over the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(b)At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and its
compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take
any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section
2.8.

Section 2.9 Company 401(k) Plan Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Nicolet, the Company or the
holder of any shares of Company Common Stock, each share of Company Common
Stock held in the Commerce State Bank 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan (the
"Company 401(k) Plan") will be converted into the right to receive a cash
payment equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio and the Nicolet Common
Stock Price, rounded to the nearest $0.01, plus the Supplemental Cash
Consideration, if any. ARTICLE 3

duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free
of preemptive rights. The Bank neither has nor is bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any
character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock
or any other equity security of the Bank or any securities representing the
right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any
other equity security of the Bank.

Section 3.7 Financial Statements and Reports; Regulatory Filings.

(a)The financial statements provided by the Company to Nicolet for the years
ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 (including the related notes, where
applicable) have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, except in each case as
indicated in such statements or the notes thereto, and comply in all material
respects with all applicable Legal Requirements. Taken together, the financial
statements (collectively, the "Company Financial Statements") are complete and
correct in all material respects and fairly and accurately present the
respective financial position, assets, liabilities and results of operations
of the Company and the Bank at the respective dates of and for the periods
referred to in the Company Financial Statements, subject to normal year-end
audit adjustments in the case of unaudited Company Financial Statements. The
Company Financial Statements do not include any assets or omit to state any
liabilities, absolute or contingent, or other facts, which inclusion or
omission would render the Company Financial Statements misleading in any
material respect as of the respective dates thereof and for the periods
referred to therein.

(b)The Company Regulatory Reports have been filed with the appropriate
Regulatory Authority. The Company Regulatory Reports have been prepared in
material compliance with the rules and regulations of the respective federal
or state banking regulator with which they were filed, except as otherwise
noted therein. Each Company Regulatory Report fairly presents, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company or the Bank, as appropriate,
and the results of its operations at the date and for the period indicated in
such Company Regulatory Report in conformity with the Instructions for the
Preparation of Call Reports and other relevant guidance as promulgated by
applicable regulatory authorities. None of the Company Regulatory Reports
contains any material items of special or nonrecurring income or any other
income not earned in the Ordinary Course of Business, except as expressly
specified therein.

(c)The Company's independent accountants, Wipfli LLP, which have expressed
their opinion with respect to the Company Financial Statements (except those
Company Financial Statements as of December 31, 2019, which are unaudited),
are and have been throughout the periods covered by such Company Financial
Statements an independent accounting firm. Section 3.7(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedules lists all non-audit services performed by Wipfli LLP for
the Company and the Bank. As of the date hereof, Wipfli LLP has not resigned
(or informed the Company that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as
independent accountants of the Company.

(d)Each of the Company and the Bank has filed all forms, reports and documents
required to be filed since January 1, 2018, with all applicable federal or
state securities or banking authorities except to the extent failure would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and the Bank. Such forms,
reports and documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with
applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at the time they were filed,
after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed prior to the date hereof,
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except that information filed as of a later date (but before
the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify information as of an earlier
date.

(e)Except for normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Authority in the
Ordinary Course of Business of the Company and the Bank, no Regulatory
Authority has initiated since January 1, 2018, or has pending any proceeding,
enforcement action or to the Knowledge of the Company, investigation into the
business, disclosures or operations of the Company or the Bank. Since January
1, 2018, no Regulatory Authority has resolved any proceeding, enforcement
action or, to the Knowledge of the Company, investigation into the business,
disclosures or operations of the Company or the Bank. The Company and the Bank
have fully complied with, and there is no unresolved violation, criticism or
exception by any Regulatory Authority with respect to, any report or statement
relating to any examination or inspection of the Company or the Bank. Since
January 1, 2018, there have been no formal or informal inquiries by, or disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory Authority with respect to
the business, operations, policies or procedures of the Company or the Bank
(other than normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Authority in the
Company's Ordinary Course of Business). To the Knowledge of the Company, there
has not been any event or occurrence since January 1, 2018 that would result
in a determination that the Bank is not an eligible depository institution as
defined in 12 C.F.R. § 303.2(r).

Section 3.8 Books and Records. The books of account, minute books, stock
record books and other records kept by the Company and the Bank are in all
material respects complete and accurate and have been maintained in accordance
with applicable Legal Requirements and accounting requirements. The Company
Financial Statements have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the
books and records of the Company and the Bank. Each of the Company and the
Bank maintains accurate books and records reflecting its assets and
liabilities and maintains proper and adequate internal accounting controls
that provide assurance that (a) transactions are executed with management's
general or specific authorizations; (b) transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of the Company Financial Statements and the Company
Regulatory Reports in accordance with GAAP, and to maintain asset and
liability accountability; (c) access to each Company asset and incurrence of
each liability of the Company are permitted only in accordance with
management's specific or general authorizations; (d) the recorded
accountability for assets and liabilities is compared with the existing assets
and liabilities at reasonable intervals, and appropriate action is taken with
respect to any difference; and (e) extensions of credit and other receivables
are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are implemented to
effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis. None of the
Company's systems, controls, data or information are recorded, stored,
maintained, operated or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by any
means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) which (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct control of the
Company, the Bank or their accountants, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the Company
nor the Bank has been advised of any material deficiencies in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting which could reasonably
be expected to adversely affect its ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data, or any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management. No material weakness in internal controls has been identified by
the Company's auditors, and there have been no significant changes in internal
controls that could reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect
internal controls. The minute books of the Company and the Bank contain
accurate and complete records in all material respects of all meetings held
of, and corporate action taken by, its respective shareholders, boards of
directors and committees of the boards of directors. At the Closing, all of
those books and records will be in the possession of the Company and the Bank.

Section 3.9 Properties.

(a)Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedules lists or describes all
interests in real property owned by the Company and the Bank, including OREO,
as of the date of this Agreement and the principal buildings and structures
located thereon, together with the address of such real estate, and each lease
of real property to which it is a party, identifying the parties thereto, the
annual rental payable, the expiration date thereof and a brief description of
the property covered, and in each case of either owned or leased real
property, the proper identification, if applicable, of each such property as a
branch or main office or other office.

(b)The Company and the Bank has good and marketable title to all assets and
properties, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible, that it purports
to own, subject to no liens, mortgages, security interests, encumbrances or
charges of any kind except: (i) as noted in the most recent Company Financial
Statements; (ii) statutory liens for Taxes not yet delinquent or being
contested in good faith by appropriate Proceedings and for which appropriate
reserves have been established and reflected in the Company Financial
Statements; (iii) pledges or liens required to be granted in connection with
the acceptance of government deposits, granted in connection with repurchase
or reverse repurchase agreements or otherwise incurred in the Ordinary Course
of Business; (iv) easements, rights of way, and other similar encumbrances
that do not materially affect the use of the properties or assets subject
thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations
at such properties; and (v) minor defects and irregularities in title and
encumbrances that do not materially impair the use thereof for the purposes
for which they are held (collectively, the "Company Permitted Exceptions").
Each of the Company and the Bank as lessee has the right under valid and
existing leases to occupy, use, possess and control any and all of the
respective property leased by it, and each such lease is valid and without
default thereunder by the lessee or, to the Knowledge of the Company, the lessor. All buildings and structures owned by the Company and the Bank lie
wholly within the boundaries of the real property owned or validly leased by
it, and do not encroach upon the property of, or otherwise conflict with the
property rights of, any other Person.

Section 3.10 Loans; Loan Loss Reserve.

(a)Each loan, loan agreement, note, lease or other borrowing agreement by the
Bank, any participation therein, and any guaranty, renewal or extension
thereof (the "Company Loans") reflected as an asset on any of the Company
Financial Statements or reports filed with the Regulatory Authorities is
evidenced by documentation that is customary and legally sufficient in all
material respects and constitutes, to the Knowledge of the Company, the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability
thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally or equitable principles or doctrines.

(b)All Company Loans originated or purchased by the Bank were made or

of the Bank's continuing review and evaluation of the portfolio of Company
Loans under the requirements of GAAP and Legal Requirements, was established

each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401 and
related provisions of the Code is the subject of a favorable determination
letter or may rely upon an opinion letter from the IRS to the effect that it

adversely affect the qualified status of any Company Benefit Plan or the tax-

Business, there is no litigation, claim or assessment pending or, to the
Company's Knowledge, threatened by, on behalf of, or against any Company
Benefit Plan or against the administrators or trustees or other fiduciaries of
any Company Benefit Plan that alleges a violation of applicable state or
federal law or violation of any Company Benefit Plan document or related
agreement.

(g)No Company Benefit Plan fiduciary or any other person has, or has had, any
liability to any Company Benefit Plan participant, beneficiary or any other
person under any provisions of ERISA or any other applicable law by reason of
any action or failure to act in connection with any Company Benefit Plan,
including any liability by any reason of any payment of, or failure to pay,
benefits or any other amounts or by reason of any credit or failure to give
credit for any benefits or rights. Except as set forth in Section 3.12(g) of

set aside therefore and reflected in the Company Financial Statements.

there are no obligations under any Company Benefit Plan to provide health or
other welfare benefits to retirees or other former employees, directors,
consultants or their dependents (other than rights under Section 4980B of the
Code or Section 601 of ERISA or comparable state laws).

(j)No condition exists as a result of which the Company or the Bank would have
any liability, whether absolute or contingent, under any Company Benefit Plan
with respect to any misclassification of a person performing services for the
Company or the Bank as an independent contractor rather than as an employee.

former employees that are not reflected in the Company Benefit Plans.

(l)Except as identified on Section 3.12(l) of the Company Disclosure

that would be imposed by any person against the Company, any Company Benefit
Plan, or any other person, including any Company Benefit Plan participant or
beneficiary, as a result of the hypothetical liquidation as of the Closing
Date of any insurance, annuity, or investment contracts or any other similar
investment held by any Company Benefit Plan.

(m)The Company may, at any time, amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan
that it sponsors or maintains and may withdraw from any Company Benefit Plan
to which it contributes (but does not sponsor or maintain), without obtaining
the consent of any third party, other than an insurance company in the case of
any benefit underwritten by an insurance company, and without incurring
liability except for unpaid premiums or contributions due for the pay period
that includes the effective date of such amendment, withdrawal or termination
and for customary termination expenses. From and after the Closing Date,

of ninety (90) days' prior notice or less without penalty. Section 3.13 Compliance with Legal Requirements. The Company and the Bank hold

Section 4.7 Nicolet SEC Reports; Financial Statements and Reports; Regulatory
Filings.

(a)Nicolet has timely filed all Nicolet SEC Reports, and all such Nicolet SEC
Reports have complied as to form in all material respects, as of their
respective filing dates and effective dates, as the case may be, with all
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the
case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. The Nicolet
SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements in
all material respects. As of their respective filing dates, none of the
Nicolet SEC Reports contained an untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a
later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date. As of the date hereof, there are no
outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect
to any of the Nicolet SEC Reports. No Subsidiary of Nicolet is required to
file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act.

(b)The financial statements presented (or incorporated by reference) in the
Nicolet SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) have been

applicable Legal Requirements. Taken together, the financial statements
presented in the Nicolet SEC Reports (collectively, the "Nicolet Financial
Statements") are complete and correct in all material respects and fairly and
accurately present the respective financial position, assets, liabilities and
results of operations of Nicolet and its Subsidiaries at the respective dates
of and for the periods referred to in the Nicolet Financial Statements,
subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the case of unaudited Nicolet
Financial Statements. The Nicolet Financial Statements do not include any
assets or omit to state any liabilities, absolute or contingent, or other
facts, which inclusion or omission would render the Nicolet Financial

or been dismissed as independent registered public accountants of Nicolet.

provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are applicable to it or any
of its Subsidiaries. Nicolet maintains a system of disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that
are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed by Nicolet in reports that Nicolet is required to file under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to Nicolet's management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of the Nicolet Capitalization
Date, to the Knowledge of Nicolet, such controls and procedures were
effective, in all material respects, to provide such reasonable assurance.

(d)Nicolet and its consolidated Subsidiaries have established and maintained a
system of internal control over financial reporting (within the meaning of
Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) ("Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting"). Nicolet's certifying officers have evaluated the
effectiveness of Nicolet's Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of the
end of the period covered by the most recently filed quarterly report on Form
10-Q of Nicolet under the Exchange Act (the "Nicolet Evaluation Date").
Nicolet presented in such quarterly report the conclusions of the certifying
officers about the effectiveness of Nicolet's Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting based on their evaluations as of the Nicolet Evaluation Date. Since
the Nicolet Evaluation Date, there have been no changes in Nicolet's Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, Nicolet's Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Nicolet has devised and maintains a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (i)
transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific
authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management's general or specific authorization; and (iv) the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences.

(e)Nicolet and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all forms, reports and
documents required to be filed since January 1, 2018, with all applicable
federal or state securities or banking authorities except to the extent
failure would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Nicolet and its
Subsidiaries. Such forms, reports and documents: (i) complied as to form in
all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at
the time they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed
prior to the date hereof, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a
later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date.

(f)Except for normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Authority in the
Ordinary Course of Business of Nicolet and its Subsidiaries, no Regulatory
Authority has initiated since January 1, 2018, or has pending any proceeding,
enforcement action or to the Knowledge of Nicolet, investigation into the
business, disclosures or operations of Nicolet or its Subsidiaries. Since
January 1, 2018, no Regulatory Authority has resolved any proceeding
enforcement action or, to the Knowledge of Nicolet, investigation into the
business, disclosures or operations of Nicolet or its Subsidiaries. Nicolet

violation, criticism or exception by any Regulatory Authority with respect to,
any report or statement relating to any examination or inspection of Nicolet
or its Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2018, there have been no formal or
informal inquiries by, or disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory
Authority with respect to the business, operations, policies or procedures of
Nicolet or its Subsidiaries (other than normal examinations conducted by a
Regulatory Authority in Nicolet's Ordinary Course of Business). To the
Knowledge of Nicolet, there has not been any event or occurrence since January

material respects and constitutes, to the Knowledge of Nicolet, the legal,

or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally or equitable principles or doctrines.

purchased in accordance with the policies of the board of directors of Nicolet
Bank and in the Ordinary Course of Business of Nicolet Bank. (c)Nicolet Bank's allowance for loan and lease losses reflected in the Nicolet
Financial Statements (including footnotes thereto) was determined on the basis
of Nicolet Bank's continuing review and evaluation of the portfolio of Nicolet
Loans under the requirements of GAAP and Legal Requirements, was established
in a manner consistent with Nicolet Bank's internal policies, and, in the
reasonable judgment of Nicolet Bank, was adequate in all material respects

previously charged-off, on outstanding Nicolet Loans.

subject to any order or directive by; (v) is subject to any supervisory letter
from; (vi) has been ordered to pay any civil money penalty, which has not been
paid, by; or (vii) has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions
at the request of; any Regulatory Authority that currently restricts in any
material respect the conduct of its business, in any manner relates to its
capital adequacy, restricts its ability to pay dividends or interest or limits
in any material manner its credit or risk management policies, its management
or its business. To the Knowledge of Nicolet, none of the foregoing has been
threatened by any Regulatory Authority.

Section 4.14 Absence of Certain Changes and Events. Since December 31, 2019,
Nicolet and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only
in the Ordinary Course of Business, and without limiting the foregoing with
respect to each, since December 31, 2019, there has not been any event or
events that have had or would reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Nicolet. Section 4.15 No Defaults. To the Knowledge of Nicolet, no event has occurred
or circumstance exists that (with or without notice or lapse of time) may
contravene, conflict with or result in a material violation or breach of, or
give Nicolet, any of its Subsidiaries or other Person the right to declare a
default or exercise any remedy under, or to accelerate the maturity or
performance of, or to cancel, terminate or modify, any Nicolet Material
Contract.

Section 4.16 Compliance with Environmental Laws. Nicolet and each Subsidiary
of Nicolet has complied in all material respects with all Environmental Laws
applicable to it and its business operations.

Section 4.17 Transactions with Affiliates. Since January 1, 2018, all
transactions required to be disclosed by Nicolet pursuant to Item 404 of
Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act have been disclosed in the
Nicolet SEC Reports. No transaction, or series of related transactions, is
currently proposed by Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge
of Nicolet, by any other Person, to which Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries
would be a participant that would be required to be disclosed under Item 404
of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act if consummated.

Section 4.18 Approval Delays. To the Knowledge of Nicolet, there is no reason
why the granting of any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals would be denied
or unduly delayed. Nicolet Bank is an "eligible bank" (as such term is defined
at 12 C.F.R. § 5.3(g)), "well-capitalized" (as such term is defined at 12
C.F.R. § 225.2(r)) and "well managed" (as such term is defined at 12 C.F.R. §
225.2(s)), and the rating of Nicolet Bank under the CRA is no less than
"satisfactory." Nicolet Bank has not been informed that its status as an
"eligible bank," "well-capitalized," "well managed" or, for CRA purposes,
"satisfactory," will change within one (1) year.

Section 4.19 Labor Matters.

(a)There are no collective bargaining agreements or other labor union
Contracts applicable to any employees of Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries.
There is no labor dispute, strike, work stoppage or lockout, or, to the
Knowledge of Nicolet, threat thereof, by or with respect to any employees of
Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries, and there has been no labor dispute,
strike, work stoppage or lockout in the previous three (3) years. There are no
organizational efforts with respect to the formation of a collective
bargaining unit presently being made, or to the Knowledge of Nicolet,
threatened, involving employees of Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither
Nicolet nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged or is engaging in any unfair
labor practice. Nicolet and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Legal Requirements respecting employment and
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages, hours of work
and occupational safety and health. No Proceeding asserting that Nicolet or
any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice (within the
meaning of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935) or seeking to compel
Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries to bargain with any labor organization as
to wages or conditions of employment is pending or, to the Knowledge of
Nicolet, threatened with respect to Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries before
the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission or any other Regulatory Authority.

(b)Neither Nicolet nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or otherwise
bound by, any consent decree with, or citation by, any Regulatory Authority
relating to employees or employment practices. None of Nicolet, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their executive officers has received within the
past three (3) years any written notice of intent by any Regulatory Authority
responsible for the enforcement of labor or employment laws to conduct an
investigation relating to Nicolet or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the
Knowledge of Nicolet, no such investigation is in progress.

information provided to the directors on all such boards or members of such
committees in connection with all meetings of the board of directors and
committees of the board of directors of the Company or otherwise provided to
the directors or members, and to provide any other financial reports or other
analysis prepared for senior management of the Company or the Bank; in each

individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances
known to it, to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; or (b)

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein that

to comply with this section shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or
the failure of any condition set forth in Article 8 to be satisfied unless the
underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently
result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article 8 to be satisfied.

Section 5.4 Shareholders Meeting. The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date the Registration Statement is declared effective,
take all action necessary, including as required by and in accordance with the
WBCL, the Company Articles of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws to duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the

propose or resolve to withdraw, qualify or adversely modify) the Company
Board's recommendation to the Company's shareholders that the Company's
shareholders vote in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement (an
"Adverse Recommendation"). However, if, prior to the time the Company
Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board, after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside counsel, determines in good faith that (a)
an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (b) it is
reasonably likely that to continue to recommend this Agreement to its
shareholders in light of such Acquisition Proposal would result in a violation
of its fiduciary duties under the WBCL, then, in submitting this Agreement at
the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company Board may make an Adverse
Recommendation or publicly propose or resolve to make an Adverse
Recommendation.

Section 5.5 Information Provided to Nicolet. The Company agrees that the
information concerning the Company or the Bank that is provided or to be
provided by the Company in writing to Nicolet specifically for inclusion in
the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement and any other documents to be

Transactions will: (a) at the respective times such documents are filed and,
in the case of the Registration Statement, when it becomes effective and, with
respect to the Proxy Statement, when mailed, not be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; or (b) in the case of the Proxy
Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, at the time of the
Company Shareholders Meeting, not be false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any
statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of any
proxy for the meeting in connection with which the Proxy Statement shall be
mailed. The Company will have a duty to correct any material misleading
statement specified by the Company for inclusion, and so included, in the
Registration Statement or Proxy Statement and any other documents filed with
any Regulatory Authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall
have no responsibility for the truth or accuracy of any information with

document submitted to, or other communication with, any Regulatory Authority.

Merger; provided, however, that the foregoing actions shall not unduly
interfere with the business operations of the Company or the Bank. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall provide office space and support
services (and other reasonably requested support and assistance) in connection
with the foregoing, and senior officers of the Company and Nicolet shall meet
from time to time as the Company or Nicolet may reasonably request, to review
the financial and operational affairs of the Company and the Bank, and the
Company shall give due consideration to Nicolet's input on such matters, with
the understanding that, notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement: (a) neither Nicolet nor Nicolet Bank
shall under any circumstance be permitted to exercise control of the Company
or the Bank prior to the Effective Time; (b) neither the Company nor the Bank
shall be under any obligation to act in a manner that could reasonably be
deemed to constitute anti-competitive behavior under federal or state
antitrust laws; and (c) neither the Company nor the Bank shall be required to
agree to any material obligation that is not contingent upon the consummation
of the Merger.

Section 5.7 Company Benefit Plans.

(a)At the request of Nicolet, and subject to the obligations of Nicolet
pursuant to Section 7.6 below, the Company shall take all appropriate action
prior to the Effective Time to amend, suspend or terminate as of the Effective
Time any Company Benefit Plan.

(b)Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall accrue the costs associated
with any contingent payments due or that could become due in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions (including possible terminations of employment in
connection therewith) under any Company Benefit Plan, including without
limitation any change of control or severance agreements, retention or stay
bonus programs, or other similar arrangements.

Section 5.8 Voting and Support Agreement. Concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall cause to be executed and
delivered to Nicolet a voting and support agreement, in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B, approving this Agreement and the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions, executed by each director of the Company who holds
Company Common Stock.

Section 5.9 Acquisition Proposals.

(a)The Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons other than Nicolet
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best
efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company will within one (1) Business Day advise
Nicolet of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof
(including the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal), and
will keep Nicolet apprised of any related developments, discussions and
negotiations (including the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal) on a reasonably current basis.

(b)The Company agrees that it will not, and will cause the Bank and its and
the Bank\'s officers, directors, agents, advisors and affiliates not to,
initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals
with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any
confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions
with, any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than contacting
a Person for the sole purpose of seeking clarification of the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal); provided that, in the event the
Company receives an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal, from a Person
other than Nicolet, after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, and the Company Board concludes
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or
would reasonably be likely to result in a Superior Proposal and, after
considering the advice of outside counsel, that failure to take such actions
would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Company may: (i) furnish
information with respect to it to such Person making such Acquisition Proposal
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (subject to the requirement
that any such information not previously provided to Nicolet shall be promptly
furnished to Nicolet); (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding such Acquisition Proposal; and (iii) terminate this Agreement in
order to concurrently enter into an agreement with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal; provided, however, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 5.9 unless and until (x) five (5) Business Days have
elapsed following the delivery to Nicolet of a written notice of such
determination by the Company Board and, during such five (5) Business-Day
period, the parties cooperate with one another with the intent of enabling the
parties to engage in good faith negotiations so that the Contemplated
Transactions may be effected, and (y) at the end of such five (5) Business-Day
period, the Company Board continues, in good faith and after consultation with
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, to believe that a Superior
Proposal continues to exist. (c)Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from complying with Rule 14d‑9 and Rule 14e‑2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, provided that such Rules will in
no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules
would otherwise have under this Agreement.

Section 5.10 Calculation of Tangible Common Equity. The Company shall deliver
the calculation of Tangible Common Equity to Nicolet, accompanied by
appropriate supporting detail, no later than the close of business on the
fifth (5th) Business Day preceding the Closing Date, and such calculation
shall be subject to verification and approval by Nicolet and its independent
auditors, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Section 5.11 Audited Financial Statements. The Company shall deliver to
Nicolet financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, which
financial statements shall (a) be complete and correct in all material
respects, (b) fairly and accurately present the respective financial position,
assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Company and the Bank, (c)
be prepared in conformity with GAAP, (d) comply in all material respects with
all applicable Legal Requirements, and (e) be subject to and accompanied by
the unmodified opinion of the Company's independent public accountants,
Wipfli, LLP.

Section 5.12 Company Debt Agreements. If requested by Nicolet, the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to repay in full all indebtedness
owing under any Company Debt Agreement, and to deliver to Nicolet prior to
Closing evidence of such repayment and evidence of the release of any security
interests in assets of the Company related thereto. If necessary, the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) cause the Bank to pay a
dividend to the Company in an amount sufficient to allow the Company to make
any requested repayments and (b) obtain any required regulatory approvals
necessary to enable the Company to pay any such requested payments and to
enable the payment of the dividend by the Bank described in clause (a). For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.12 shall affect the
obligation of the Company to obtain any consents set forth on Section 8.12 of
the Company Disclosure Schedules relating to any indebtedness that remains
outstanding as of the Effective Time.

warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein that reasonably could be
expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a

"Indemnification Proceeding") to which the Indemnified Party was made a party
by virtue of his or her service in any of the capacities set forth above in
clauses (1) through (3) of this Section 6.3(a), to the extent that such
Indemnified Party has been successful on the merits or otherwise in the
defense of such Indemnification Proceeding.

(b)From and after the Effective Time, Nicolet shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, indemnify and hold harmless (1)
any natural person who is or was an employee or agent of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company, (2) any natural person who, while an employee or
agent of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, is or was serving
either pursuant to the Company's or such Subsidiary's specific request or as a
result of the nature of such person's duties to the Company or to such
Subsidiary as a director, officer, partner, trustee, member of any governing
or decision-making committee, manager, employee or agent of another
corporation or foreign corporation, partnership joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, and (3) any natural person who, while an employee or agent of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, is or was serving an employee
benefit plan because his or her duties to the Company or to such Subsidiary
also imposed duties on, or otherwise involved services by, the person to the
plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan (each, an "Indemnified
Employee"), against any and all Expenses in connection with any
Indemnification Proceeding to which the Indemnified Employee was made a party
by virtue of his or her service in any of the capacities set forth above in
clauses (1) through (3) of this Section 6.3(b), to the extent that such
Indemnified Employee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in the
defense of such Indemnification Proceeding.

(c)From and after the Effective Time, Nicolet shall indemnify and hold
harmless any Indemnified Party against any obligation to pay a judgment,
penalty, assessment, forfeiture or fine, including an excise tax assessed with
respect to an employee benefit plan, or the agreement to pay any amount in
settlement of an Indemnification Proceeding, and pre- and post-judgment
interest related thereto, and any Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with an Indemnification Proceeding, unless it shall be proven by
final judicial adjudication that such person breached or failed to perform a
duty owed to the Company or to any Subsidiary of the Company which
constituted: (1) a willful failure to deal fairly with the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company, or the respective shareholders thereof in
connection with a matter in which the Indemnified Party had a material
conflict of interest, (2) a violation of the criminal law, unless the
Indemnified Party had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was
lawful or no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful,
(3) a transaction from which the Indemnified Party derived an improper
personal benefit, or (4) willful misconduct.

(d)From and after the Effective Time, Nicolet may indemnify and hold harmless
any Indemnified Employee against any obligation to pay a judgment, penalty,
assessment, forfeiture or fine, including an excise tax assessed with respect
to an employee benefit plan, or the agreement to pay any amount in settlement
of an Indemnification Proceeding, and pre- and post-judgment interest related
thereto, and any Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Employee in connection
with an Indemnification Proceeding, unless it shall be proven by final
judicial adjudication that such person breached or failed to perform a duty
owed to the Company or to any Subsidiary of the Company which constituted: (1)
a willful failure to deal fairly with the Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company, or the respective shareholders thereof in connection with a matter in which the
Indemnified Employee had a material conflict of interest, (2) a violation of
the criminal law, unless the Indemnified Employee had reasonable cause to
believe that his or her conduct was lawful or no reasonable cause to believe
that his or her conduct was unlawful, (3) a transaction from which the
Indemnified Employee derived an improper personal benefit, or (4) willful
misconduct. Any determination of whether an Indemnified Employee shall receive
indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.3(d) shall be made at the sole and
exclusive discretion of Nicolet.

(e)Upon written request by an Indemnified Party who has been made party to an
Indemnification Proceeding, Nicolet shall reimburse the Expenses of such
Indemnified Party as incurred if the Indemnified Party provides Nicolet with
all of the following: (1) a written affirmation of his or her good faith
belief that he or she did not breach or fail to perform his or her duties to
the Company and (2) a written undertaking, executed personally or on his or
her behalf, to repay to Nicolet such reimbursements if and to the extent that
it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to
indemnification for such amounts under the terms of this Agreement.

(f)Upon written request by an Indemnified Employee who has been made party to
an Indemnification Proceeding, Nicolet may reimburse the Expenses of such
Indemnified Employee as incurred if the Indemnified Employee provides Nicolet
with all of the following: (1) a written affirmation of his or her good faith
belief that he or she did not breach or fail to perform his or her duties to
the Company or to any Subsidiary of the Company and (2) a written undertaking,
executed personally or on his or her behalf, to repay to Nicolet such
reimbursements if and to the extent that it is ultimately determined that such
Indemnified Employee was not entitled to indemnification for such amounts
under the terms of this Agreement. Any determination of whether an Indemnified
Employee shall receive reimbursement for Expenses as such Expenses are
incurred pursuant to this Section 6.3(f) shall be made at the sole and
exclusive discretion of Nicolet.

(g)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in order for any
Indemnified Party or Indemnified Employee to be entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement, such Indemnified Party or Indemnified Employee must make
a written request to Nicolet. This written request shall contain a declaration
that Nicolet shall have the right to exercise all rights and remedies
available to such Indemnified Party or Indemnified Employee against any other
Party arising out of or related to the Indemnification Proceeding for which
indemnification is being sought and that the Indemnified Party or Indemnified
Employee has assigned to Nicolet all such rights and remedies. Nicolet shall
have no obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party or Indemnified Employee
under this Agreement if and to the extent that such Indemnified Party or
Indemnified Employee has previously received indemnification or allowance for
Expenses from any Party in connection with the same Indemnification
Proceeding.

(h)For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time or, if such term
coverage is not available, such other maximum period of coverage available,
Nicolet shall maintain a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy
or policies covering each Indemnified Party and Indemnified Employee covered
by the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy in effect
as of the date hereof, on and subject to terms and conditions no less
advantageous to the insureds than the Company's directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof, for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, that in no event
shall Nicolet be required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount in
excess of 300% of the amount of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company for
fiscal year 2019 for such purpose and, if Nicolet is unable to maintain such
policy (or substitute policy) as a result of this proviso, Nicolet shall
obtain a policy or policies of insurance with substantially similar terms and
conditions as may then be available, and with an equal or lesser claims
reporting time period as may then be available for payment of such amount;
provided further, that in lieu of the obligations of this subsection, Nicolet
may request that the Company obtain, and upon such request the Company shall
obtain, such extended reporting period coverage under the Company's existing
insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective Time).

(i)If Nicolet or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with
or merge into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each
such case, Nicolet shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause proper
provision to be made so that the successor and assign of Nicolet assumes the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.3. (j)The provisions of this Section 6.3 shall survive consummation of the Merger
and the Bank Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, each Indemnified Employee, his or her
heirs, and his or her legal representatives.

Subsidiaries will cooperate and use all reasonable best efforts to as promptly
as possible prepare, file, effect and obtain all Requisite Regulatory
Approvals, and the parties will comply with the terms of such Requisite
Regulatory Approvals. Each of Nicolet and the Company will have the right to

Nicolet shall prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement, in
which the Proxy Statement will be included. Nicolet shall use its reasonable

Capital Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC to amend the Proxy Statement or
the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information. The parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to respond (with the assistance of the other party) as
promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. If
prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with respect to the Company,
Nicolet or any Subsidiary of the Company or Nicolet, respectively, or any
change occurs with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the
Company or Nicolet, respectively, for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement that, in each case, is required to be described in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement, the Company or Nicolet, as applicable, shall promptly notify the
other of such event, and the Company or Nicolet, as applicable, shall
cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement and, as
required by applicable Legal Requirements, in disseminating the information
contained in such amendment or supplement to the Company's shareholders.

Section 7.3 Publicity. Neither the Company nor Nicolet shall, and neither the
Company nor Nicolet shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect
to, or otherwise make any public statement or, except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Agreement, any disclosure of nonpublic
information to a third party, concerning, the Contemplated Transactions
without the prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) of Nicolet, in the case of a proposed announcement, statement or
disclosure by the Company, or the Company, in the case of a proposed
announcement, statement or disclosure by Nicolet; provided, however, that
either party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after
prior consultation with the other party to the extent practicable under the
circumstances), issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements or
by the Nasdaq Rules. Subject to the foregoing, Nicolet and the Company agree
that the press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement
shall be a joint press release of Nicolet and the Company, mutually agreed

paragraph, Nicolet and the Company shall each use their reasonable best
efforts to develop a joint communications plan with respect to the

best efforts to satisfy the various covenants and conditions to Closing in

terms or provisions of this Agreement. Between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date, each of Nicolet and the Company will, and will cause each
Subsidiary of Nicolet and the Company, respectively, and all of their
respective Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate with respect to all

Legal Requirements and the instructions of any Regulatory Authority, each
party shall keep the other party reasonably apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the Contemplated Transactions, including
promptly furnishing the other party with copies of notices or other written
communications received by it or any of its Subsidiaries from any Regulatory
Authority with respect to such transactions. Without limiting the foregoing,
none of Nicolet, the Company or their respective Boards of Directors shall
take any action that would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to
this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, and each shall take all
necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the
Contemplated Transactions from any applicable Takeover Statute now or
hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the Contemplated Transactions, each party and the members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Contemplated
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the Contemplated Transactions,
including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such
Takeover Statute.

Section 7.5 Tax Free Reorganization.

(a)The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a nontaxable reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) and related sections of the Code and that
this Agreement constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 1.368-2(g) of the income tax regulations promulgated under the Code.
From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each
of the Company and Nicolet shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, and will not knowingly take any action, cause any action
to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken
which action or failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the
Effective Time, neither Nicolet nor any Affiliate of Nicolet knowingly shall
take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action, or
cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act could
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

(b)As of the date hereof, the Company does not know of any reason why it would
not be able to deliver to Nicolet's counsel, as of the date of the legal
opinion referred to in Sections 8.8 and 9.8, a certificate substantially in
compliance with IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with reasonable or
customary exceptions and modifications thereto (the "IRS Guidelines"), to
enable counsel to Nicolet to deliver the legal opinion contemplated by
Sections 8.8 and 9.8, and the Company hereby agrees to deliver such
certificate effective as of the date of such opinion to counsel to Nicolet.

(c)As of the date hereof Nicolet does not know of any reason (i) why it would
not be able to deliver to its counsel, as of the date of the legal opinion
referred to in Sections 8.8 and 9.8, a certificate substantially in compliance
with the IRS Guidelines, to enable counsel to Nicolet to deliver the legal
opinion contemplated by Sections 8.8 and 9.8, and Nicolet hereby agrees to
deliver such certificates effective as of the date of such opinions; or (ii)
why counsel to Nicolet would not be able to deliver the opinion required by
Sections 8.8 and 9.8. Nicolet hereby agrees to deliver such certificate
effective as of the date of such opinion to counsel to Nicolet.

(d)Nicolet will continue at least one significant historic business line of
the Company, or use at least a significant portion of the Company's historic
business assets in a business, in each case within the meaning of Treas. Reg.
Section 1.368-1(d), except that Nicolet may transfer the Company's historic
business assets (i) to a corporation that is a member of Nicolet's "qualified
group," within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii), or (ii)
to a partnership if (A) one or more members of Nicolet's "qualified group"
have active and substantial management functions as a partner with respect to
the Company's historic business or (B) members of Nicolet's "qualified group"
in the aggregate own an interest in the partnership representing a significant
interest in the Company's historic business, in each case within the meaning
of Treas. Reg. Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(iii).

Section 7.6 Employees and Employee Benefits.

(a)All individuals employed by the Company or the Bank immediately prior to
the Closing ("Covered Employees") shall automatically become employees of
Nicolet as of the Closing. Following the Closing, Nicolet shall maintain
employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the benefit of
Covered Employees that provide employee benefits and compensation
opportunities that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than the employee
benefits and compensation opportunities that are made available to similarly-
situated employees of Nicolet under the Nicolet Benefit Plans; provided,
however, that: (i) in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to
participate in any closed or frozen Nicolet Benefit Plan; and (ii) until such
time as Nicolet shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the Nicolet
Benefit Plans, a Covered Employee's continued participation in the Company
Benefit Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this
sentence (it being understood that participation in the Nicolet Benefit Plans
may commence at different times with respect to each Nicolet Benefit Plan). (b)For all purposes (other than purposes of benefit accruals and allocations
of employer contributions under Nicolet's 401(k) Plan) under the Nicolet
Benefit Plans providing benefits to the Covered Employees (the "New Plans"),
each Covered Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with
the Company and the Bank and their respective predecessors to the same extent
as such Covered Employee was entitled to credit for such service under any
applicable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated or
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Transition Date;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service.

(c)In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of
the Transition Date, Nicolet shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide that: (i) each Covered Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is similar in type to an applicable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was participating immediately
prior to the Transition Date (such Company Benefit Plans prior to the
Transition Date collectively, the "Old Plans"); (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or similar benefits to
any Covered Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements of such New Plan shall be waived for such Covered Employee
and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the Old Plan in which such Covered Employee, as applicable,
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Transition Date; and (iii) any eligible expenses incurred by such Covered
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the Transition Date shall be taken into account
under such New Plan to the extent such eligible expenses were incurred during
the plan year of the New Plan in which the Transition Date occurs for purposes
of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Covered Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

(d)Nicolet and the Company shall determine and establish a retention bonus
program for certain employees of Nicolet and the Company who remain employed
through the Closing, or at Nicolet for an interim period following Closing.
The Company and Nicolet shall mutually agree as to each employee eligible to
receive a retention bonus and the amount of each such retention bonus.

Section 7.7 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Nicolet will take
such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any acquisition of
Nicolet Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 7.8 Shareholder Litigation. Each of the Company and Nicolet shall give
the other the reasonable opportunity to consult concerning the defense of any
shareholder litigation against the Company or Nicolet, as applicable, or any
of their respective directors or officers relating to the Contemplated
Transactions.

Section 11.3 Assignments, Successors and No Third Party Rights. Neither party
to this Agreement may assign any of its rights under this Agreement (whether

representation, warranty, covenant, agreement and provision hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Except for Section 6.3, nothing
expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any
Person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of
this Agreement. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit
of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 11.5
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
persons other than the parties may not rely upon the representations and
warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

supplemented by the parties at any time before or after the Company

this Agreement which are for the benefit of the waiving party. Any agreement
on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. Neither the
failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement will
operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other
or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. Except as provided in Article 10, the rights

FORM OF VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT





Nicolet Bankshares, Inc.

Attention: Chief Executive Officer



Ladies and Gentlemen:



The undersigned is a shareholder of Commerce Financial Holdings, Inc. (the
"Company"), a Wisconsin corporation and a registered bank holding company
under the BHC Act. This Voting and Support Agreement relates to the Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of February [17], 2020 (the "Agreement"), between
the Company and Nicolet Bankshares, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation ("Nicolet").
Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company will be merged into and with
Nicolet (the "Merger"), and the shares of the Company's common stock, $0.01
par value per share (the "Company Common Stock") will be converted into and
exchanged for the merger consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional
shares pursuant to the Agreement. This Voting and Support Agreement represents
an agreement between the undersigned and Nicolet regarding certain rights and
obligations of the undersigned in connection with the Merger.



In consideration of the execution and delivery by Nicolet of the Agreement and
the mutual covenants, conditions and agreements contained herein and therein,
the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the undersigned
and Nicolet, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:



1. Vote on the Merger. The undersigned agrees to vote all shares of Company Common Stock that the undersigned owns beneficially or of record in favor of approving the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, unless Nicolet is then in breach or default in any material respect as regards any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty as to it contained in the Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this sentence shall be deemed to require the undersigned to vote any shares of Company Common Stock over which the undersigned has or shares voting power solely in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of any person, if the undersigned determines, in good faith after consultation with legal counsel, that such a vote would cause a breach of fiduciary duty to such other person.



2. Restriction on Transfer. The undersigned further agrees that the undersigned will not, without the prior written consent of Nicolet, transfer any shares of Company Common Stock prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the Termination Date, each such term as set forth in the Agreement, except (a) by operation of law, (b) by will, (c) under the laws of descent and distribution, (d) with the prior written consent of Nicolet, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, for any sales, assignments, transfers or other dispositions necessitated by hardship, or (e) as Nicolet may otherwise agree in writing.



3. No Agreement as Director or Officer. The undersigned makes no agreement or understanding in this Voting and Support Agreement in the undersigned's capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and nothing in this Voting and Support Agreement: (a) will limit or affect any actions or omissions taken by the undersigned in the undersigned's capacity as such a director or officer, including exercising rights under the Agreement, and no such actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this Voting and Support Agreement, or (b) will be construed to prohibit, limit or restrict the undersigned from exercising the undersigned's fiduciary duties as an officer or director to the Company or its shareholders.



4. Miscellaneous. This Voting and Support Agreement is the complete agreement between Nicolet and the undersigned concerning the subject matter hereof. Any notice required to be sent to any party hereunder shall be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or electronic mail using the addresses set forth herein or such other address as shall be furnished in writing by the parties. This Voting and Support Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Wisconsin. 5. Termination. This Voting and Support Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest of (a) the mutual written agreement of the undersigned and Nicolet, (b) the Effective Time, (c) the termination of the Agreement in accordance with its terms, and (d) other than as contemplated by Section 2.1 of the Agreement, any reduction in the merger consideration, extension of the Termination Date, change in the type of merger consideration, or other amendment, modification, waiver or change to the Agreement that is material and adverse to the undersigned and not consented to in advance in writing by the undersigned. For avoidance of doubt, a decline in Nicolet's stock price shall not be considered a reduction in the merger consideration.



6. Capitalized Terms. Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms in this Voting and Support Agreement shall have the same meaning as given such terms in the Agreement.
