iv MERGER AGREEMENT

 

This Merger Agreement (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of December 4, 2011, is
among Entergy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Entergy_ "), Mid South
TransCo LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and presently a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Entergy (" _TransCo_ "), ITC Holdings Corp., a Michigan
corporation (" _ITC_ "), and Ibis Transaction Subsidiary LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of ITC ("
_Merger Sub_ ").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Entergy is engaged, through the Utility OpCos, in the Transmission
Business;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Entergy has determined that it is advisable
and in the best interests of Entergy and its shareholders to separate the
Transmission Business from Entergy and to divest the Transmission Business in
the manner contemplated hereby and by the Separation Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the Parties contemplate that the Transmission Business shall be
transferred to TransCo as provided in the Separation Agreement and, in
connection therewith, the Financings shall take place;

WHEREAS, the Parties contemplate that, following the Financings and
immediately following the TransCo Transfer, Entergy shall consummate the
disposition of one hundred percent (100%) of the TransCo Common Units to its
shareholders (the " _Distribution_ ") either (i) through a dividend of
TransCo Common Units to Entergy shareholders on a _pro rata_ basis (a " _Spin-
Off_ ") or (ii) through an offer to exchange (an " _Exchange Offer_ ") TransCo
Common Units for currently outstanding shares of Entergys common stock ("
_Entergy_ _Common Stock_ "), or a combination of a Spin-Off and Exchange Offer
as Entergy may elect in its sole discretion;

 

WHEREAS, in the event that Entergys shareholders subscribe for less than all
of the TransCo Common Units offered in the Exchange Offer, Entergy shall
distribute, _pro rata_ to its shareholders, any unsubscribed TransCo Common
Units immediately following the consummation of the Exchange Offer (the "
_Clean-Up Spin-Off_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the Parties contemplate that on or about the Distribution Date,
Entergy shall cause the Entergy Exchangeable Debt, if any, to be exchanged
for the TransCo Securities for the purpose of facilitating the establishment
of the appropriate liquidity and capital structure for each of Entergy and
TransCo;

WHEREAS, the Parties contemplate that Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
TransCo, with TransCo surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of
ITC, such Merger to take place immediately following the Distribution, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the DLLCA; WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Entergy has (i) determined that it is
advisable and in the best interests of Entergy and its shareholders, and
declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
Transactions and (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions;

WHEREAS, Entergy or its relevant Subsidiary, as the sole member of TransCo,
has adopted this Agreement and approved the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of ITC has (i) determined that it is
advisable, fair to and in the best interests of ITC and its shareholders, and
declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
applicable Transactions, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the applicable
Transactions and (iii) resolved, subject to the terms of this Agreement, to
recommend to its shareholders approval of the Merger, the ITC Stock Issuance
and the Charter Amendment;

WHEREAS, ITC or its relevant Subsidiary, as the sole member of Merger Sub,
has approved this Agreement and the Transactions applicable to Merger Sub;

WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, the Parties intend
that the Merger qualifies as a "reorganization" pursuant to Section 368 of the
Code; and

WHEREAS, Entergy, TransCo, ITC and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in
connection with the Transactions, and also to prescribe certain conditions to
the Transactions.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, Entergy, TransCo, ITC and Merger Sub
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

_TRANSACTIONS_

 

Section 1.01 _Closing_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 1440
New York Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20005, at 10:00 a.m., local time on the
fifth Business Day following satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
by applicable Law) of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VI_
(other than those conditions, including the Distribution, that by their nature
or pursuant to the terms of this Agreement are to be satisfied at or
immediately prior to the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, where
permitted, the waiver of those conditions), or at such other date, time or
place as Entergy and ITC may mutually agree. The date on which the Closing
occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

 



2 Section 1.02 _Initial Issuance of TransCo Common Units_.

 

(a) As contemplated by Section 1.06 of the Separation Agreement and subject to
adjustment as provided in  _Section 1.02(c)_, in partial consideration for
the transfer of Assets contemplated by Section 3.01 of the Separation
Agreement (including the Entergy Contribution), TransCo will issue and deliver
to Entergy a number of TransCo Common Units equal to the sum of the
following:

(i) (A) 1.00400801603206 (the " _Initial Issuance Exchange Ratio_ "),
multiplied by the number of shares of ITC Common Stock on a Fully Diluted
Basis, minus (B) the number of TransCo Common Units outstanding immediately
prior to the issuance of TransCo Common Units pursuant to this Section 1.02,
plus

(ii) the quotient of the Aggregate Disqualified Shares Number _divided by_
49.9%, as calculated pursuant to Section 1.02(c) of the ITC Disclosure Letter
(which details the calculation as of the date of this Agreement); _provided_ ,
_however_ , in no event shall the number of TransCo Common Units issued
pursuant to this _Section 1.02(a)(ii)_ exceed an amount that would result,
pursuant to _Section 1.02(c)_, in the Transaction Maximum Principal Amount
being reduced in an amount in excess of $100 million.

 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Fully Diluted Basis_ " shall mean the Parties best estimate, mutually
agreed in good faith, without duplication, of (A) the number of shares of ITC
Common Stock that are outstanding as of the Closing Date, plus (B) (1) the
number of restricted shares of ITC Common Stock and stock units outstanding as
of the Closing Date and (2) the number of shares of ITC Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of any options or rights of any nature, whatsoever, whether
contingent, vested or unvested, or otherwise, both (1) and (2) to be based
upon the treasury stock method, which shall include ITC restricted shares and
the net of new ITC shares that would be issued if in-the-money ITC options
were exercised and ITC used the proceeds from the exercise price to repurchase
ITC shares at the Reference Price (for the avoidance of doubt, the assumed
proceeds used to repurchase ITC shares will be limited to the amount, if any,
that an employee must pay upon exercise) consistent with Section 1.02(b)(i) of
the ITC Disclosure Letter (which details the calculation as of the date of
this Agreement), in each case for clarification other than the shares of ITC
Common Stock issued or to be issued in the Merger, including pursuant to the
Employee Matters Agreement. The Parties binding estimate of the number of
shares of ITC Common Stock on a Fully Diluted Basis shall be made on the
Estimation Date using, for the purposes of the treasury stock method
calculations, the Reference Price for the price of ITC Common Stock for all
options and rights included in the calculation (for purposes of this estimate
only).

(ii) " _Estimation Date_ " means the nearest reasonably practicable date
prior to the date on which the Exchange Offer is commenced (or prior to the
last Trading Day that ends at least twenty (20) Trading Days prior to the date
the Parties expect the Distribution Date to occur, if Entergy elects to
effect the Distribution as a Spin-Off) as mutually agreed in writing by the
Parties, or such other date as may be reasonably agreed to by the Parties.

 



3 (iii) " _Aggregate Disqualified Shares Number_ " means the Parties best
estimate, mutually agreed in good faith, of the number of shares of ITC Common
Stock issuable upon exercise to any TransCo Employees in connection with the
conversion of Entergy stock options and restricted shares to ITC
stock options and restricted shares as provided in _Article VII_ of the
Employee Matters Agreement and are reasonably likely to be treated as being
issued as part of a plan or series of related events that would cause Code
Section 355(e) to apply to the Distribution, and assuming, solely for
purposes of this calculation, that the Equity Exchange Ratio (as such term is
used in the Employee Matters Agreement) used for conversion of Entergy stock
options and restricted shares is based on the Reference Price of ITC Common
Stock and Entergy Common Stock (which assumption shall have no impact on the
determinations of the Equity Exchange Ratio for all purposes under the
Employee Matters Agreement).

 

(iv) " _ITC Equity Value_ " means (A) the Reference Price _multiplied by_ (B)
the number of shares of ITC Common Stock on a Fully Diluted Basis _plus_ the
aggregate number of TransCo Common Units issued pursuant to _Section
1.02(a)(i)_.

(v) " _Additional TransCo Units_ " means the aggregate number of TransCo
Common Units issued pursuant to _Section 1.02(a)(ii)_.

 

(vi) " _Value of the Additional TransCo Units_ " means (A) the Additional
TransCo Units _multiplied by_ (B) (1) the ITC Equity Value _divided by_ (2)
the number of shares of ITC Common Stock on a Fully Diluted Basis _plus_ the
aggregate number of TransCo Common Units issued pursuant to _Section
1.02(a)(i)  __plus_ the Additional TransCo Units.

(vii) " _Disqualified Shares Principal Reduction Amount_ " means (A) Value of
the Additional TransCo Units _divided by_ (B) 49.9%.

(c) As part of the Ruling Request, Entergy is seeking certain rulings with
respect to the treatment under Section 355(e) of the Code of certain issuances
of shares of ITC Common Stock to be issued to TransCo Employees in connection
with the conversion of Entergy stock options and restricted shares into ITC
stock options and restricted shares (any such shares to be issued or issuable
upon exercise, the " _TransCo Employee Shares_ "). The ruling requested would
treat the TransCo Employee Shares as not having been acquired as part of a
plan (or series of related events) within the meaning of Code Section 355(e).
In the event that Entergy does not receive the intended Ruling with respect to
the TransCo Employee Shares and, after discussions with Entergys tax
advisors (in consultation with ITC), Entergy reasonably determines as of the
Estimation Date that any of the TransCo Employee Shares may be treated as
being issued as part of a plan or series of related events that would cause
Code Section 355(e) to apply to the Distribution (any such TransCo Employee
Share, a " _Disqualified Share_ "), the Transaction Maximum Principal Amount
shall be reduced in an amount equal to the Disqualified Shares Principal
Reduction Amount. Section 1.02(c) of the ITC Disclosure Letter sets forth a

 



4  calculation of the Disqualified Shares Principal Reduction Amount as of the
date of this Agreement. The calculation of the number of Disqualified Shares
shall be based upon the treasury stock method in a manner consistent with the
treasury stock method used to calculate the Fully Diluted Basis. The Parties
binding estimate of the number of Disqualified Shares shall be made on the
Estimation Date using for the purposes of the treasury stock method
calculations, the Reference Price for the price of ITC Common Stock for all
options and rights included in the calculation (for purposes of this estimate
only).

 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 1.02_, in no event
shall the number of TransCo Common Units issued to Entergy pursuant to this
_Section 1.02_ be an amount less than that which shall be necessary so that
the holders of TransCo Common Units immediately prior to the Merger,
constitute the holders of at least a 50.1% of the outstanding ITC Common
Stock immediately following the Merger; _provided_ , that, except as otherwise
contemplated in this _Section 1.02_, in the event that the application of
this _Section 1.02(d)_ shall require an increase in the number of shares of
TransCo Common Units issued to Entergy, the Parties shall in good faith
mutually agree to such other modifications to the financial terms of this
Agreement, including the amount of the Special Dividend and/or
Share Repurchase and/or the Transaction Maximum Principal Amount, as
necessary to put the Parties in the same position as they were in prior to any
such adjustment pursuant to the application of this _Section 1.02(d)_.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 1.02_, if, prior to or
after the Closing, the Parties identify an error in the assumptions,
estimations or calculations resulting in the determination of the number of
TransCo Common Units to be issued to Entergy under this _Section 1.02_, the
Parties agree to take all such actions as may be necessary to correct such
error such that the condition set forth in the first sentence of this _Section
1.02(d)_ is satisfied. For the avoidance of doubt, this provision shall be
interpreted in a manner that ensures a sufficient number of TransCo Common
Units are issued to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 355(e) with
respect to TransCo post-Closing.

 

Section 1.03 _The Distribution; Special Dividend and Share Repurchase_.

 

(a) Entergy may, in its sole discretion, elect to effect the Distribution as a
Spin-Off, as an Exchange Offer, or as a combination of a Spin-Off and an
Exchange Offer with or without a Clean-Up Spin-Off and shall advise ITC of the
form of the Distribution no later than thirty (30) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date.

 

(b) To the extent the Distribution includes a Spin-Off, subject to the terms
thereof, in accordance with  _Section 1.03(d)_, each Record Holder shall be
entitled to receive for each share of Entergy Common Stock held by such Record
Holder a number of TransCo Common Units equal to the total number of TransCo
Common Units subject to the Spin-Off and held by Entergy on the Record Date
(determined pursuant to _Section 1.02_), multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of shares of Entergy Common Stock held by
such Record Holder and the denominator of which is the total number of shares
of Entergy Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date. To the extent the
Distribution is effected as a Spin-Off, prior to the Distribution Date, the
Board of Directors of Entergy, in accordance with applicable Law,
shall establish the Record Date for the Distribution and any appropriate
procedures in connection with the Spin-Off. To the extent any of the
Distribution is effected as an Exchange Offer followed by a Clean-Up Spin-Off
of any remaining TransCo 

 



5  Common Units to be distributed by Entergy pursuant to _Section 1.03(c)_,
the Board of Directors of Entergy shall set the Record Date as the time on the
Distribution Date immediately following the time at which the validly
tendered shares of Entergy Common Stock are accepted for payment in the
Exchange Offer.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to the extent any of the
Distribution is effected as an Exchange Offer, each Entergy shareholder may
elect in the Exchange Offer to exchange a number of shares of Entergy Common
Stock held by such Entergy shareholder for TransCo Common Units. Subject to
applicable securities Laws, Entergy shall determine, in its sole discretion,
the terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer, including the exchange ratio
(including any discount to the reference price of ITC Common Stock), the
timing of the offer period and any extensions thereto, and other customary
provisions, each as will be set forth in the TransCo Registration Statements
and Schedule TO;  _provided, however_ , that before filing the TransCo
Registration Statements, the Schedule TO or any amendments or supplements
thereto, or comparable documents under securities or state "blue sky" laws of
any jurisdiction, Entergy and/or TransCo (as applicable) will furnish to ITC
and its counsel copies of all such documents proposed to be filed (including
all exhibits thereto), which documents will be subject to the reasonable
comment of ITC and its counsel, and, before filing any such document, Entergy
and/or TransCo (as applicable) shall reasonably consider any changes thereto
that ITC and its counsel shall reasonably request; _provided, further_ , that
the maximum number of days that the Exchange Offer may be extended following
satisfaction of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 6.01(g)_,
_Section 6.02(g)_ and _Section 6.03(g)_ shall be ten (10) Business Days;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, to the extent permitted pursuant to the
securities Laws, it shall be a term and condition of the Exchange Offer that
no Entergy shareholder who is a "Market Participant" (as defined in ITCs
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation) shall be permitted to
exchange for a number of TransCo Common Units that, together with (x) TransCo
Common Units that would be received by such shareholder in any Clean-Up Spin-
Off and (y) shares of ITC Common Stock beneficially owned or anticipated to
be beneficially owned by such shareholder, would cause such shareholder
following the Effective Time, together with any "group" (as defined in Rule
13d-5 of the Exchange Act) of which it is a member, to beneficially
own shares constituting five percent (5%) or more of the total number of
shares of any class or series of capital stock of ITC.

(d) The terms and conditions of any Clean-Up Spin-Off shall be as determined
by Entergy in its sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any
TransCo Common Units that are not subscribed for in the Exchange Offer must
be distributed to Entergys shareholders in the Clean-Up Spin-Off and (ii)
subject to any applicable Law or stock exchange requirement, the Clean-Up
Spin-Off shall take place on the Distribution Date immediately following the
consummation of the Exchange Offer and the Record Date for the Clean-Up Spin-
Off shall be established as of such date in the same manner as provided in
_Section 1.03(b)_.

 

(e) In connection with the other Transactions, prior to the Merger (regardless
whether the actual payment date for any Special Dividend is before, on or
after the Effective Time) ITC may, in its sole discretion, elect to (i)
declare a special dividend (whether or not payable in connection with the ITC
Financing) to the ITC Shareholders (a "Special Dividend") in which the amount
payable to such holders does not exceed $700 million in the aggregate, (ii)
effect a repurchase of ITC Common Stock from the ITC Shareholders, the terms 

 



6  and conditions of which shall be as determined by ITC in its sole discretion
(a " _Share Repurchase_ "), in which the purchase price payable to such
holders does not exceed $700 million in the aggregate, or (iii) effect a
combination of a Special Dividend and a Share Repurchase in which the amount
payable to ITC Shareholders in both transactions does not exceed $700 million
in the aggregate. ITC shall take all action necessary to prohibit ITCs
Dividend Reinvestment Plan from reinvesting, on behalf of any participants,
the proceeds of the Special Dividend in ITC Common Stock, through purchase or
otherwise, after the Closing.

 

(f) Entergy shall be entitled to delay the Distribution Date and ITC shall be
entitled to delay the consummation of a Special Dividend and/or a Share
Repurchase, in each case, to the extent necessary to comply with any NYSE
rules relating to notices of record dates and dividends and to comply with
applicable securities Laws relating to offer periods and extensions thereof
(including the availability of any required financial statements) and
otherwise relating to exchange offers, tender offers and dividends; _provided_
, that the Distribution Date or the consummation of a Special Dividend and/or
a Share Repurchase shall occur reasonably promptly after any such compliance.
The Share Repurchase shall be conducted in accordance with applicable
securities Laws. Each of ITC and Entergy shall also be entitled to delay the
Distribution Date for a maximum of twenty (20) calendar days, in consultation
with its financial advisors, to take into account any then existing market
conditions and the ability to market the ITC Financing and/or the Financings.

 

(g) Upon the consummation of the Distribution, Entergy shall deliver to the
Exchange Agent a global certificate representing the TransCo Common Units
being transferred in the Distribution, for the account of Entergys
shareholders that are entitled thereto. The Exchange Agent shall hold such
certificate or certificates, as the case may be, for the account of Entergys
shareholders pending the Merger. In no event shall the number of TransCo
Common Units issued and distributed in the Distribution exceed the number of
TransCo Common Units determined pursuant to _Section 1.02(a)_, as adjusted
if necessary pursuant to _Section 1.02(d)_.

(h) The Parties shall keep each other reasonably informed with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 1.03_ in order to coordinate the
timing of such transactions to the extent reasonably practicable and desirable
and otherwise consistent with the other provisions of this _Section 1.03_.

Section 1.04 _Plan of Reorganization_. This Agreement is in furtherance of a
"plan of reorganization" for the Merger under Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-2(g).

Section 1.05 _The Merger_.

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall be merged (the " _Merger_ ") with and into TransCo in accordance with
the provisions of the DLLCA whereupon the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and TransCo shall continue as the surviving entity in
the Merger (the " _Surviving Company_ ") and shall be a wholly owned direct
Subsidiary of ITC.

 



7 (b) The Merger shall be consummated by the filing of a certificate of
merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in accordance with, and
containing such information as is required by, the relevant provisions of the
DLLCA, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall
become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as is
agreed among the Parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DLLCA (such date and time is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.06 _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DLLCA.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of TransCo and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of TransCo and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company, all as provided under the
DLLCA.

Section 1.07 _Certificate of Formation and Limited Liability Company Agreement
of the Surviving Company; Managers and Officers of the Surviving Company_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of formation of TransCo as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of
formation of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with
the provisions thereof and hereof and applicable Law.

(b) At the Effective Time, the limited liability company agreement of Merger
Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the limited
liability company agreement of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended
in accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof and applicable Law.

(c) The initial managers of the Surviving Company at the Effective Time shall
be the managers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time. The
initial officers of the Surviving Company at the Effective Time shall be the
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each of such
initial officers and managers of the Surviving Company shall hold office from
the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified in the manner provided by the limited liability
company agreement of the Surviving Company or as otherwise provided by
applicable Law.

Section 1.08 _Board of Directors of ITC and Management Appointees_.

(a) ITC will take all necessary corporate actions to cause, at the Effective
Time, there to be at least two (2) vacancies on the Board of Directors of ITC,
which two (2) vacancies will be filled immediately after the Effective Time
with two (2) directors nominated by ITCs Nominating/Corporate Governance
Committee as described in this _Section 1.08(a)_. Prior to the Closing, ITC
will engage an executive search firm to assist its Nominating/Corporate
Governance Committee in identifying two (2) candidates to fill such vacancies,
which candidates will, in addition to any other qualifications or criteria
established by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, (i) qualify as
independent directors on the

 



8  Board of Directors of ITC for purposes of the rules of the NYSE, Rule 10A-3
of the Exchange Act, and the ITC Groups FERC independence requirements and
(ii) possess a knowledge and understanding of (1) the Transmission industry
or electric utility industry and (2) the service territory of the Transmission
Business, including in each case with respect to the business, customer,
environmental, energy, political and regulatory issues faced by the
Transmission Business. ITC shall keep Entergy reasonably informed of such
search process, and Entergy shall be entitled to offer any number of
candidates to fill such vacancies to the Nominating/Corporate Governance
Committee in connection with such search process, acknowledging that any
decision with respect to such candidates shall reside solely with the
Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors of ITC.

 

(b) ITC and TransCo shall take all action necessary to appoint the persons
listed in Section 1.08(b) of the Entergy Disclosure Letter to management
positions at TransCo or ITC, as indicated after their respective names in such
section (the " _Management Appointees_ "), as of the Effective Time. If prior
to the Effective Time, any Management Appointee is unwilling or unable to
serve in such designated management position as a result of illness, death,
resignation or any other reason, then a replacement for such person, if any,
shall be mutually agreed by ITC and Entergy and shall be a TransCo Employee.

Section 1.09 _Effect on Equity Interests_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of TransCo, Merger Sub, ITC or the holders of any securities (or
membership interests) of TransCo, Merger Sub or ITC, subject to _Section
1.13_, each TransCo Common Unit, other than any Cancelled Units, shall be
converted into the right to receive one fully paid and nonassessable share of
ITC Common Stock (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "). The shares of ITC Common Stock to
be issued upon the conversion of TransCo Common Units pursuant to this
_Section 1.09(a)_ and cash in lieu of fractional shares of ITC Common Stock
to be paid as contemplated by _Section 1.13_ are referred to collectively as
" _Merger Consideration_." As of the Effective Time, all such TransCo Common
Units shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and any holder of a certificate representing
any such TransCo Common Units shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 1.11_ upon
surrender of such certificate, without interest. The issuance of ITC Common
Stock in connection with the Merger is referred to as the " _ITC Stock
Issuance_."

(b) Each TransCo Common Unit that is owned, directly or indirectly, by ITC or
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or held by TransCo
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Cancelled Units_ ") shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement.

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, each unit of common membership interest of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one common membership interest unit of the
Surviving Company and shall constitute

 



9  the only outstanding limited liability company membership interests of the
Surviving Company. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates (if
any) representing the common membership interests of Merger Sub shall be
deemed for all purposes to represent the number of units of common membership
interests of the Surviving Company into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

Section 1.10 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) Pursuant to _Section 1.03(d)_, the Exchange Agent shall hold, for the
account of the relevant Entergy shareholders, the global certificate(s)
representing all of the outstanding TransCo Common Units distributed in the
Distribution. Such TransCo Common Units shall be converted into shares of ITC
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this  _Article I_.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Entergy shall appoint a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to ITC as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").
Prior to or at the Effective Time, ITC shall deposit with the Exchange Agent,
for the benefit of the holders of TransCo Common Units, for exchange in
accordance with this  _Article I_ through the Exchange Agent, evidence in
book entry form representing the shares of ITC Common Stock issuable pursuant
to this _Article I_ in exchange for outstanding TransCo Common Units. For the
purposes of such deposit, ITC shall assume that there shall not be any
fractional shares of ITC Common Stock. ITC shall make available to the
Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed
or as reasonably requested by Entergy, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of
fractional shares in accordance with _Section 1.13_ and cash sufficient to
pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section 1.14_. All
evidence in book entry form of ITC Common Stock including cash in lieu of
fractional shares of ITC Common Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 1.13_
and the amount of any dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
the ITC Common Stock pursuant to _Section 1.14_ are hereinafter referred to
as the " _Exchange Fund_." Following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the ITC Common Stock to
be issued pursuant to this _Article I_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

Section 1.11 _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time of the Merger, and to the extent not previously distributed
in connection with the Distribution, ITC shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to any holder of record of outstanding TransCo Common Units whose
TransCo Common Units were converted into the right to receive a portion of the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.09(a)_; (a) a letter of
transmittal and (b) instructions for use in effecting the exchange of any
TransCo Common Units for Merger Consideration. Upon delivery to the Exchange
Agent of the letter of transmittal, duly executed and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such TransCo
Common Units shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor that number of
whole shares of ITC Common Stock (after taking into account all TransCo Common
Units exchanged by such holder) that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article I_ , payment by cash or check in
lieu of fractional shares of ITC Common Stock which such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to _Section 1.13_ and any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to  _Section 1.14_. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be registered in the name of a Person other than the
Person in whose name the applicable

 



10  TransCo Common Units is registered, it shall be a condition to the
registration thereof that the applicable TransCo Common Units to be exchanged
be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such delivery
of the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration pay any and all transfer
and other similar Taxes required to be paid as a result of such registration
in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such TransCo
Common Units or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
Taxes have been paid or are not payable. Until exchanged as contemplated by
this _Section 1.11_, any TransCo Common Units shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such exchange the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this _Section 1.11_ and any amounts to be paid pursuant to
_Section 1.13_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the Merger
Consideration or any cash payable upon exchange of any TransCo Common Units.

 

Section 1.12 _No Further Ownership Rights in TransCo Common Units_. The
portion of the Merger Consideration issued (and paid) and any cash paid in
accordance with the terms of this _Article I_ upon conversion of any TransCo
Common Units shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such TransCo Common Units. At
the Effective Time, the membership interest transfer books of TransCo shall
be closed with respect to the TransCo Common Units that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the membership interest transfer books of the
Surviving Company of TransCo Common Units that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any certificates
formerly representing TransCo Common Units are presented to the Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article I_.

Section 1.13 _No Fractional Shares_.

(a) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of ITC Common
Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of TransCo Common Units pursuant to
_Section 1.09(a)_, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of ITC Common Stock. For
purposes of this _Section 1.13_, all fractional shares to which a single
record holder would be entitled shall be aggregated, and calculations shall be
rounded to three decimal places.

(b) Fractional shares of ITC Common Stock that would otherwise be allocable to
any former holders of TransCo Common Units in the Merger shall be aggregated,
and no holder of TransCo Common Units shall receive cash equal to or greater
than the value of one (1) full share of ITC Common Stock. The Exchange Agent
shall cause the whole shares obtained thereby to be sold, in the open market
or otherwise as reasonably directed by ITC, and in no case later than thirty
(30) Business Days after the Effective Time. The Exchange Agent shall make
available the net proceeds thereof, after deducting any required withholding
Taxes and brokerage charges, commissions and transfer Taxes, on a _pro rata_
basis, without interest, as soon as practicable to the holders of TransCo
Common Units entitled to receive such cash. Payment of cash in lieu of
fractional shares of ITC Common Stock shall be made solely for the purpose of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience to ITC of issuing fractional shares of
ITC Common Stock and shall not represent separately bargained-
for consideration.

 



11 Section 1.14 _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends
or other distributions with respect to ITC Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unexchanged
TransCo Common Units with respect to the shares of ITC Common Stock issuable
upon exchange thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall
be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 1.13_, until, in each case,
the exchange of such TransCo Common Units in accordance with this _Article I_.
Subject to applicable Law, following the exchange of any such TransCo Common
Units, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate representing whole
shares of ITC Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (a)
at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a
fractional share of ITC Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to _Section 1.13_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of ITC Common Stock and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such exchange payable with respect to such whole shares of ITC Common Stock.
In no event shall the Exchange Agent have the right to vote any shares of ITC
Common Stock held by the Exchange Agent.

 

Section 1.15 _Withholding Rights_. Entergy, ITC, the Surviving Company or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. Any withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Persons with respect to which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 1.16 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of TransCo Common Units for one hundred
eighty (180) calendar days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to ITC
upon demand, and any holders of TransCo Common Units who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article I_ shall thereafter look only to ITC for payment
of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of ITC Common Stock pursuant to _Section 1.13_ and any dividends or
distributions pursuant to _Section 1.14_.

Section 1.17 _No Liability_. None of the Parties or the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any Person in respect of any TransCo Common Units or ITC Common
Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

Section 1.18 _Post-Merger Operations_.

 

(a) For three (3) years from and after the Effective Time, TransCo shall have
a regional headquarters in Jackson, Mississippi, as well as a regional
presence for the TransCo Subs within the four-state region in which the
Transmission Business principally operates.

 



12 (b) Entergy and ITC each agree, to the extent consistent with the ITC Groups
FERC independence requirements, that provision of charitable contributions and
community support in the communities in which ITC and the Transmission
Business of Entergy currently operate serve a number of important
corporate goals. During the three-year period immediately following the
Effective Time, ITC intends to provide charitable contributions and other
community support within the communities in which the Transmission Business
operates, at a level comparable in the aggregate to the levels currently
provided by ITC in its other service territories.

Section 1.19 _Dissenters Rights_. In accordance with Sections 754 and 762 of
the MBCA, each ITC Shareholder who objects to the Merger and complies with the
provisions of the MBCA concerning the rights of ITC Shareholders to dissent
from the Merger and require appraisal of their shares of ITC Common Stock
(each such share of ITC Common Stock, a " _Dissenting Share_ ") and has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (each such
shareholder duly making such demand, a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ "), shall
be entitled to such rights as are granted by the MBCA. Any payments made with
respect to Dissenting Shares shall be made by or on behalf of ITC. If any
Dissenting Shareholder, at any time prior to payment for the Dissenting
Shares, shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) the right to payment as a Dissenting Shareholder, such holder shall
forfeit such holders rights as a Dissenting Shareholder and continue to hold
the shares of ITC Common Stock as such holder held such shares immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Each Dissenting Shareholder, who becomes entitled
to payment for any Dissenting Shares pursuant to the MBCA, shall, after
such payment is made, cease to be a holder of ITC Common Stock for all
purposes under the MBCA.

Section 1.20 _Exchange Trust_. The Parties agree that, notwithstanding the
terms of _Section 1.03_, Entergy may elect, by written notice to ITC
delivered at least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the Closing to retain up
to that number of TransCo Common Units that would convert in the Merger to up
to 4.9999% of the total number of shares of ITC Common Stock outstanding
immediately following the consummation of the Merger that otherwise would have
been distributed in the Distribution on or prior to the Closing Date, and at
the Closing such retained TransCo Common Units will convert to ITC Common
Stock in the Merger. Such TransCo Common Units and the ITC Common Stock into
which they convert are referred to collectively as the " _Retained Equity_."
At the Closing, the Retained Equity shall be contributed by Entergy to, and
thereafter held by, a Delaware trust or other arrangement mutually agreed to
by ITC and Entergy (the " _Exchange Trust_ "). The sole trustee of the
Exchange Trust shall be a nationally recognized trust company or similar
institution mutually agreed to by Entergy and ITC. Entergy shall not control
the Exchange Trust or the Retained Equity held by it, other than the right to
cause the Retained Equity to be distributed pursuant to this _Section 1.20_.
Any such Retained Equity held in the Exchange Trust will be distributed
through an exchange offer for outstanding shares of Entergy Common Stock
within six (6) months after the Closing (or if earlier, the end of the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs); _provided_ , _however_ , if at the
end of such period no exchange offer has been effectuated in which all of the
Retained Equity has been distributed to the shareholders of Entergy, the
Retained Equity shall be distributed _pro rata_ to the shareholders of
Entergy. The trust agreement governing the Exchange Trust shall provide that,
following the Closing, the Retained Equity may not be transferred other than
pursuant to this _Section 1.20_, and that the Trustee will vote the Retained
Equity in any and all

 



13  matters on which such Retained Equity is entitled to vote in the same
proportion as all voting securities of ITC (other than the Retained Equity)
that actually vote on such matter are voted. If necessary, ITC shall provide
customary registration rights to Entergy with respect to the Retained Equity
for the transactions contemplated by this _Section 1.20_. Each of Entergy and
ITC agrees to use reasonable best efforts to negotiate in good faith to
finalize the terms of any additional agreements that would be necessary to
implement this _Section 1.20_ within sixty (60) days following date of this
Agreement, including a registration rights agreement and trust agreement, and
to work cooperatively thereafter until the Closing to implement the terms of
this _Section 1.20_, including to address any concerns that a Governmental
Authority may express with respect to the Retained Equity or the Exchange
Trust and to address any reasonable comments from the trustee, once selected
pursuant to this _Section 1.20_. All reasonable costs and expenses incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this  _Section 1.20_
shall be borne or reimbursed by Entergy, including the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel of ITC incurred in connection therewith. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Entergy will be deemed to have elected not to pursue
the transactions contemplated by this _Section 1.20_, and the Parties will
have no further obligation under this _Section 1.20_, if (i) after
discussions with FERC and each Partys legal advisors, a reasonable
determination is made by either Party that doing so would reasonably be
expected to result in a determination that any member of the ITC Group shall
no longer (or in the case of TransCo and its Subsidiaries, shall not) be
deemed independent by FERC, (ii) FERC does not expressly approve the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 1.20_ in the FERC Approvals or
(iii) Entergy is unable to obtain a ruling from the IRS that the
implementation of the Exchange Trust will not affect the Distribution being a
wholly tax-free exchange, the implementation of the transactions contemplated
by this _Section 1.20_ and/or the distribution or exchange of the Retained
Equity by Entergy to the Entergy shareholders would otherwise be inconsistent
with the Ruling or unreasonably delay its receipt by Entergy or cause the Tax
Opinion not to be delivered.

ARTICLE II

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ENTERGY _

For all purposes of this _Article II_ , for the avoidance of doubt, TransCo
and each other member of the TransCo Group shall be a Subsidiary of Entergy
immediately prior to the Effective Time (without giving effect to the
Distribution). Entergy hereby represents and warrants to ITC as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Closing Date that, (i) except as set forth in
the applicable section (or another section to the extent provided in _Section
8.14_) of the Entergy Disclosure Letter or (ii) to the extent expressly
disclosed in any report, schedule, form or other document filed with, or
furnished to, the SEC by Entergy or TransCo and publicly available prior to
the date of this Agreement and after January 1, 2009, to the extent that the
relevance of such disclosure to the applicable representation and warranty is
reasonably apparent on its face (other than any forward-looking disclosures
set forth in any risk factor section (except for any disclosure therein
related to historical facts), any disclosures in any section relating to
forward-looking statements and any other similar disclosures included therein
to the extent that they are primarily cautionary in nature):

 



14 Section 2.01 _Due Organization, Good Standing and Corporate Power_. Entergy is
a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Delaware. ESI, TransCo and each of the Utility OpCos is
(and when formed, the TransCo Subs will be) a corporation or other entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization. Entergy and its
Subsidiaries have all requisite corporate or limited liability company power
and authority to own, lease and operate their respective properties and
Assets that shall be contributed to TransCo or the TransCo Subs pursuant to
the Separation Agreement and to carry on the Transmission Business as it is
now being conducted. Entergy and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified
or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the property or Assets owned, leased or operated by the Transmission
Business that shall be contributed to TransCo or the TransCo Subs pursuant to
the Separation Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the nature of the
Transmission Business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary,
except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
and in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Transmission Business MAE.

Section 2.02  _Authorization of Agreement_.

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Other Transaction Agreements by each of Entergy, the Utility OpCos, ESI and
TransCo, as applicable, and the consummation by each of them of the
Transactions, have been duly authorized and approved by their respective
Boards of Directors or Boards of Managers (and this Agreement has been
adopted by Entergy as the sole shareholder of TransCo) and no other corporate,
limited liability company or shareholder action on the part of Entergy, the
Utility OpCos, ESI or TransCo is necessary to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Other Transaction
Agreements or the consummation of the Transactions. Upon the adoption of this
Agreement by Entergy as the sole shareholder of TransCo, the approval of
TransCos equityholders after the consummation of the Distribution will not
be required to effect the Transactions.

(b) This Agreement and the Separation Agreement have been, and the applicable
Ancillary Agreements to which each is a party, when executed, shall be, duly
executed and delivered by each of Entergy, the Utility OpCos, ESI and TransCo,
as applicable, and, to the extent it is a party thereto, each is (or when
executed shall be) a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Entergy,
the Utility OpCos, ESI and TransCo enforceable against each of Entergy, the
Utility OpCos, ESI and TransCo, as applicable, in accordance with their
terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Law
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and rules of Law
governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies.

Section 2.03 _Capital Structure_.

(a) On the date of this Agreement, the authorized limited liability company
membership interests of TransCo consisted solely of 1,000 TransCo Common
Units, of which 1,000 TransCo Common Units were issued and outstanding. All
outstanding TransCo Common Units are, and all such TransCo Common Units that
may be issued prior to the Effective Time as contemplated by this Agreement
and the Separation Agreement shall be when issued, duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not issued in violation of any pre-
emptive right, purchase option, call, right of first refusal or any similar
right.

 



15 (b) On the date of this Agreement and immediately prior to the
Distribution, all the outstanding TransCo Common Units are and shall be
owned, directly or indirectly, by Entergy free and clear of any Security
Interest other than any Security Interests pursuant to the Financings.
Immediately following the Distribution, (i) there shall be outstanding a
number of TransCo Common Units determined in accordance with this Agreement
and the Separation Agreement, (ii) no TransCo Common Units shall be held in
TransCos treasury or by any Subsidiary of TransCo and (iii) no bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness of TransCo or any of its Subsidiaries
having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities
having the right to vote) on any matters on which holders of TransCo Common
Units or the holders of capital stock of any of TransCos Subsidiaries may
vote shall be outstanding.

(c) Except as contemplated by this Agreement and the Separation Agreement,
there are no outstanding or authorized options, warrants, rights,
subscriptions, claims of any character, agreements, obligations, convertible
or exchangeable securities, or other commitments, contingent or otherwise,
relating to TransCo Common Units or any equivalent limited liability company
membership interest or other nominal interest in TransCo or any of
its Subsidiaries which relate to TransCo (collectively, " _TransCo Equity
Interests_ ") pursuant to which TransCo or any of its Subsidiaries is or may
become obligated to issue TransCo Equity Interests or any securities
convertible into, exchangeable for, or evidencing the right to subscribe for,
any TransCo Equity Interests. There are no outstanding obligations of TransCo
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding TransCo Equity
Interests.

 

(d) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
TransCo or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting or
registration of, or restricting any person from purchasing, selling, pledging
or otherwise disposing of, the capital stock or other equity interest of
TransCo or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 2.04 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_.

contract or arrangement that could result, separately or in the aggregate, in
the payment to TransCo Employees of any "excess parachute payments" within the

and no notice of cancellation or termination has been received by Entergy or
any Subsidiary with respect to any such policy which has not been replaced on
substantially similar terms prior to the date of such cancellation or
termination. For the avoidance of doubt, while no policy of insurance of

remedies, (ii) there exists no default or breach on the part of any member of
the Entergy Group and to the Knowledge of Entergy, on the part of any third
party, (iii) no event has occurred which, with or without the giving of notice

SEC Filings_ "). The ITC SEC Filings when filed or furnished with or to the
SEC (or, if amended or supplemented, then as of the time of its most recent

in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act
and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and

internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act),
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. ITCs disclosure controls
and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by ITC in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
ITCs management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and all such required certifications have
been made. ITCs management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness
of ITCs internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended

were not or are not expected to be, as applicable, material, individually or
in the aggregate), and each presented fairly in all material respects the
consolidated financial position and results of operations of ITC and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the
respective periods indicated therein, except as otherwise noted therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring
adjustments, which were not or are not expected to be, as applicable,

GAAP, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, to be reflected on a
consolidated balance sheet of ITC and its consolidated Subsidiaries or in the
notes thereto, except for liabilities and obligations that (i) were incurred
since September 30, 2011 and in the ordinary course of business, (ii) are

_however_ , that with respect to projected financial information provided by
or on behalf of ITC, ITC represents only that such information was prepared
in good faith by management of ITC on the basis of assumptions believed by
such management to be reasonable as of the time made.

 

(b) All documents that ITC is responsible for filing with any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions will comply in all material
respects with the provisions of all applicable Laws and Orders. All
information supplied or to be supplied by ITC in any document, other than the

(a) Section 3.11(a) of the ITC Disclosure Letter lists all material

maintained or contributed to by ITC or any trade or business, whether or not

agreement, contract or arrangement that could result, separately or in the
aggregate, in the payment of any "excess parachute payments" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

 

(h) No ITC Benefit Plan provides benefits, including death or medical benefits
(whether or not insured), with respect to current or former employees or
directors of ITC or any of its Subsidiaries beyond their retirement or other

each case other than payments or settlements (A) that do not exceed $5
million individually and $25 million in the aggregate in any consecutive
12-month period, will be paid in full by Entergy prior to the Separation Time
and only involves monetary damages or (B) that have become due and payable
prior to the date hereof ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the exceptions set
forth in clauses (A) and (B) shall not apply to any proceedings arising out of
or related to this Agreement, the Other Transaction Agreements or the
Transactions);

(xiii) (A) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, on a reasonable basis, (1) discuss with ITC any material
change in its or its Subsidiaries regulated Transmission rates or charges,
standards of service or regulatory accounting with respect to
the Transmission Business from those in effect on the date of this Agreement
or (2) consult with ITC prior to making any filing (or any amendment thereto),
or effecting any agreement, commitment, arrangement or consent, whether
written or oral, formal or informal, with respect to the Transmission
Business matters described in _Section 4.01(c)(xiii)(A)(1)_ (other than

any formula rate that governs the recovery of Transmission costs at retail)
and (B) shall not make, or permit any Subsidiary to make, any filing to change
its Transmission rates on file with the FERC or any other Commission that
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a

any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to consult or have discussions with
ITC prior to (i) entering into arrangements with customers in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices, (ii) taking any of the
actions described in this subsection (xiii) concerning pass-through charges or
Transmission charges in accordance with existing formula rates or (iii)
making any filing (or any amendment thereto), or effecting any agreement,

informal, with respect to ordinary course changes in Entergys or
its Subsidiaries regulated Transmission rates or charges, standards of
service or regulatory accounting with respect to the Transmission Business;

 



46 (xiv) shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, to maintain with
financially responsible insurance companies (or through self-insurance not
inconsistent with such Partys past practice), insurance in such amounts and

utility industry and at substantially the same levels with respect to the
Transmission Assets as is in effect on the date hereof;

(xv) (A) shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, commit to any
capital expenditure for which TransCo or any of its Subsidiaries would be
liable for following the Closing that is not specifically set forth in Section
4.01(c)(xv) of the Entergy Disclosure Letter or that together with any other
capital expenditures so incurred is in excess of $100 million in the aggregate
in any consecutive twelve (12) month period, excluding expenditures required
in connection with prudent emergency repairs required to avoid immediate
material damage to any Assets of the Transmission Business and (B) shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to make capital
expenditures in accordance with the capital expenditures budget set forth in
Section 4.01(c)(xv) of the Entergy Disclosure Letter, taking into account
regulatory developments and factors outside of Entergys control;

 

(xvi) shall not, and shall not permit any of TransCo or the TransCo Subs to,
amend or otherwise change its or their (as applicable) Organizational
Documents, except as expressly required by this Agreement or permitted under
Article I of the Separation Agreement;

(xvii) shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into
or amend any Contract or take any other action, if such Contract, amendment of
a Contract or action would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Transactions,
including any Contract or action inconsistent with or contrary to the receipt
of all necessary approvals from state and federal regulatory authorities to
allow the Transmission Business to become a member of an Acceptable RTO;

(xviii) shall cause the System Agreement to be amended, and seek FERC
approval of that amendment pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA, such that the
System Agreement does not apply to ITC Group or the Transmission businesses of
the ITC Group, does not direct Transmission functions to be performed by
Entergy employees or business units and otherwise does not conflict with the
FERC independence provisions applicable to the ITC Group, except that the
System Agreement, as amended, may retain such provisions as may be necessary
to allocate costs among the Entergy Subsidiaries in relation to the
Transmission Business; and

(xix) shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, commit or
agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the foregoing actions.

 

(d) Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time and the Termination Date, Entergy covenants and agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to obtain any necessary
regulatory approvals to effect prior to Closing the migration of the
Transmission Business to a regional transmission organization (the 

 



47  " _RTO Migration_ ") that satisfies the criteria set forth in Section
4.01(d)(i) of the Entergy Disclosure Letter (an " _Acceptable RTO_ ") and
otherwise in accordance with the actions specified in Section 4.01(d)(ii) of
the Entergy Disclosure Letter and to keep ITC apprised of the status of such
RTO Migration and material developments with respect thereto, including
promptly notifying ITC following any material communications with any
Governmental Authority relating to the RTO Migration and providing ITC with a
copy of any such written communications (if requested) to the extent not
prohibited by the applicable Governmental Authority. Entergy will consult
with ITC with respect to any proposal, condition or limitation that arises in
such proceedings that could reasonably be expected to have a material and
adverse financial or operational impact on TransCo or its Subsidiaries or any
other member of the ITC Group after the Closing which impact was not expressly
contemplated by Section 4.01(d)(ii) of the Entergy Disclosure Letter (an "
_RTO Adverse Impact_ "). Entergy will not take any action that would
reasonably be expected to cause an RTO Adverse Impact without ITCs prior
written consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). In the event that ITC does not grant such consent, and
Entergy determines it is necessary or appropriate to take such action
nonetheless, the Parties shall negotiate for a period of thirty (30) calendar
days to reach a mutually agreeable resolution with respect to such matter. If
no such resolution is obtained, Entergy may take such specified action
following the end of such thirty (30) day period, and, _provided_ that Entergy
has complied with the terms of this _Section 4.01(d)_, ITCs sole recourse
with respect to such action shall be to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.01(k)_.

Section 4.02 _Conduct of ITC Pending the Closing_.

(a) Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time and the Termination Date, except as may be consented to in
writing by Entergy (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) or as expressly required by this Agreement or the
Other Transaction Agreements or as set forth in Section 4.02 of the ITC
Disclosure Letter, ITC covenants and agrees that each of ITC and each of its
Subsidiaries shall conduct its operations in, and shall not take any action
except only in accordance with, the ordinary course of business, consistent
with past practice and Good Utility Practice and shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact their present business
organizations, to maintain in effect all existing ITC Permits, to
maintain rights and franchises, to maintain all material Assets of ITC, to
preserve their relationships with Governmental Authorities, key employees,
customers and suppliers and others having significant business dealings with
them and to comply in all material respects with all Laws and ITC Permits of
all Governmental Authorities applicable to them, _provided_ , _however_ , that
no action by ITC or its Subsidiaries with respect to matters specifically
addressed by any provision of  _Section 4.02(c)_ shall be deemed a breach of
this sentence unless such action would constitute a breach of such other
provision.

(b) Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time and the Termination Date, neither ITC nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall take any action or cause any action to be taken which
action could cause the Transactions to fail to qualify for the Intended Tax-
Free Treatment. Following the Agreement Date and prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time and the Termination Date, ITC and members of the ITC Group will
not enter into or be a party to any Proposed Acquisition Transaction
(including approving any Proposed

 



48  Acquisition Transaction, whether for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL or
any similar corporate statute, any "fair price" or other provision of ITCs
charter or bylaws or otherwise). Following the date of this Agreement and
prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, neither
ITC nor any of its Subsidiaries shall acquire or own, directly or indirectly,
any Entergy Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 4.02(b)_
shall not be deemed to require ITC to obtain a private letter ruling from the
IRS in respect of the Tax treatment to be accorded to the Merger.

 

(c) Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time and the Termination Date, (and without limiting the generality
of _Section 4.02(a)_ and _Section 4.02(b)_), and except (A) as may be
expressly permitted or required by this Agreement or the Other Transaction
Agreements, (B) as may be required by Law, (C) as may be agreed to in writing
by Entergy (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) or (D) as set forth on Section 4.02 of the ITC Disclosure Letter,
ITC:

 

(i) shall not amend or otherwise change its Organizational Documents, except

currently outstanding stock options and equity awards under existing ITC
Benefit Plans or other grants of stock options and equity awards under
existing ITC Benefit Plans made in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice, _provided_ , that neither the timing of vesting or payment or the
amount of such equity awards shall be affected by the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (B) pursuant to the Sales Agency Financing
Agreement, _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as required by Law, in no

include any right to review the working papers of the independent auditors of
Entergy and its Subsidiaries. Entergy shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause Deloitte and Touche LLP to participate in the preparation of any pro
forma financial statements necessary or desirable for inclusion in, or
incorporation by reference into, the ITC Form S-4 and for use in connection
with the ITC Financing.

 



55 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
reasonable best efforts, including with respect to the matters contemplated
by this _Section 5.01_, shall not require Entergy or any of its Subsidiaries
to agree to or accept any term or condition to any Regulatory Approval, or any
Regulatory Approval, that includes terms or conditions that, individually or
in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse
impact on the value, financial condition or credit quality of TransCo and its
Subsidiaries or the Utility OpCos ( _provided_ , _however_ , that for
purposes of determining whether a material adverse effect has occurred, the
Utility OpCos shall be deemed to be a consolidated group of entities of the
size and scale of TransCo and its Subsidiaries) (an " _Entergy Burdensome
Condition_ "). ITC shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries, to agree
with any Governmental Authority or other Person to any term or condition to
any Regulatory Approval without the prior written consent of Entergy that
would adversely impact any member of the Entergy Group after the Closing.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, reasonable
best efforts, including with respect to the matters contemplated by this
_Section 5.01_, shall not require ITC or any of its Subsidiaries to agree to
or accept any term or condition to any Regulatory Approval, or any Regulatory
Approval that includes terms or conditions, if the terms and conditions of or
to the Regulatory Approvals would reasonably be expected to (i) (x) with
respect to the Non-FERC Approvals, have a material and adverse impact on the
value, financial condition or credit quality of TransCo and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, relative to the value, financial condition or credit quality
of TransCo and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, if no such terms and
conditions to the Regulatory Approvals were agreed, accepted, imposed or
ordered ( _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of determining any such
material and adverse impact, any impact on ITC and its Subsidiaries shall be
deemed to be an impact on TransCo and its Subsidiaries) or (y) with respect to
the FERC Approvals, result in a return on equity, target capital structure,
formula rate structure and other rate elements for the TransCo Group that,
when taken as a whole, would be materially less favorable to TransCo and its
Subsidiaries than those requested in the applications therefor filed pursuant
to _Section 5.01(b)_ or (ii) result in a determination that any member of
the ITC Group (x) shall no longer (or in the case of the TransCo and its
Subsidiaries, shall not) be deemed independent by FERC or (y) shall be subject
to regulation by any state or local Commission (other than to the extent
any such regulation relates to customary electric transmission facility
franchise or siting matters within the jurisdiction of such Commission) (each
an " _ITC Burdensome Condition_ "). Entergy shall not, and shall not permit
its Subsidiaries, to agree with any Governmental Authority or other Person to
any term or condition to any Regulatory Approval without the prior written
consent of ITC that would adversely impact any member of the ITC Group
(including TransCo and the TransCo Subs) after the Closing.

(h) To the extent that any Regulatory Approvals include terms and
conditions that will result in the incurrence of costs (including by the
Utility OpCos) in order to comply with such terms and conditions but which are
not sufficiently significant to result in the occurrence of an Entergy
Burdensome Condition or an ITC Burdensome Condition, it is agreed

 



56  by the Parties that the Entergy Group and the ITC Group shall share such
costs equally, and any true-up required between the Parties to effect this
allocation (including a possible adjustment to the Special Dividend or an
increase in the Transaction Maximum Principal Amount) shall be made in a tax
efficient manner, subject to regulatory approvals.

Section 5.02 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to an ITC Change of
Recommendation, Entergy and ITC agree that, from the date of this Agreement
through the Closing Date, no release or announcement concerning this
Agreement, the Other Transaction Agreements or the Transactions shall be
issued by ITC or Entergy without the prior written consent of Entergy or ITC,
respectively (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), except as such release or announcement (i) may be required by
applicable Law or the regulations of any applicable securities exchange or
(ii) is consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made jointly by the Parties or in investor conference
calls, SEC filings, QandAs or other documents approved by the Parties.

Section 5.03 _Financial Statements_.

(a) Entergy shall use reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof and no later than June 30, 2012, provide ITC with (i)
the audited combined financial statements of the Transmission Business,
including the combined balance sheets (or other comparable statements as
permitted under applicable securities Law) of the Transmission Business as of
December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011, and the combined statements of income
(or statements of revenues and direct expenses, or other comparable
statements as permitted under applicable securities Law), equity and cash
flows (or other comparable statements as permitted under applicable securities
Law) of the Transmission Business for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2009, December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011 (collectively, the " _Audited
Financial Statements_ ") and (ii) the unaudited combined financial statements
of the Transmission Business for applicable interim periods required for SEC
filings, including to the extent required for SEC filings or the Financings or
ITC Financing, for the periods ended March 31, 2010, June 30, 2010, September
30, 2010, March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011, September 30, 2011 and March 31,
2012, in each case together with the notes thereto if and to the extent that
notes are required for SEC filings or the Financings or ITC Financing and, in
the case of the Audited Financial Statements, a report of the independent
accountants for the Transmission Business, prepared from the books and records
of Entergy and in accordance with GAAP (with no exception or qualification
thereto) applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
(except as may otherwise be required under GAAP) and the rules and regulations
of the SEC, including the requirements of Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K
under the Exchange Act and the Securities Act and of the type and form
customarily included in offering documents used in private placements under
Rule 144A of the Securities Act (including pro forma financial information),
and which present fairly in all material respects the combined financial
position and combined results of operations of the Transmission Business as
of the dates and for the periods shown therein.

(b) After June 30, 2012, Entergy shall use reasonable best efforts to, as
promptly as practicable and no later than forty-five (45) calendar days after
the end of any fiscal quarter or ninety (90) calendar days after the end of
any fiscal year, prepare and furnish to ITC copies of combined financial
statements of the Transmission Business as of and for the periods

 



57  ending on any fiscal quarterly and annual periods ending after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, in each case together with the
notes thereto, if and to the extent that notes are required for SEC filings
or the Financings or ITC Financing, and prepared from the books and records of
Entergy and in accordance with GAAP (with no exception or qualification
thereto except that notes to quarterly Transmission Business financial
statements shall only be prepared and furnished if necessary for SEC filings
or the Financings or ITC Financing) applied on a consistent basis through the
periods involved (except as may otherwise be required under GAAP) and the
rules and regulations of the SEC to the extent required for SEC filings or
the Financings or ITC Financing, including the requirements of Regulation S-X
and Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act and the Securities Act and of the
type and form customarily included in offering documents used in private
placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act (including pro forma
financial information), and, in the case of the combined financial statements
of the Transmission Business for any fiscal year, shall be accompanied by a
report of the independent accountants for the Transmission Business. When
delivered, such financial statements shall present fairly in all material
respects the combined financial position and combined results of
operations of the Transmission Business as of the dates and for the periods
shown therein. Entergy acknowledges that ITCs ability to comply with its
obligations under _Section 5.05_ depend, in part, on Entergys timely
compliance with this  _Section 5.03_, and therefore ITC shall be afforded a
reasonable period to comply with such obligations based upon the timing of
Entergy providing the financial statements herein contemplated.

 

(c) In connection with the production of the Audited Financial Statements and
as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement and no later than
when the Audited Financial Statements are delivered, the accounting firm
preparing the Audited Financial Statements shall conduct a review of the Rate
Base Statement. The terms of any review shall be mutually agreed by Entergy
and ITC each acting reasonably. Any costs associated with the review of the
Rate Base Statement shall be borne and paid by ITC.

Section 5.04 _Access_. From the date hereof to the earlier of the Effective
Time or the Termination Date, to the extent permitted by Law, each of Entergy
and ITC shall allow all designated Representatives of Entergy or ITC, as the
case may be, access at reasonable times upon reasonable notice and in a manner
as shall not adversely impact the conduct of the business of either Party or
the Transmission Business in any material respect to the personnel, books and
records, files, correspondence, audits and properties (except as related to
Taxes), as well as to all information relating to commitments, Contracts,
titles, insurance, operational data, results of operations, and financial
position, or otherwise pertaining primarily to the business and affairs of the
Transmission Business and ITC and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be;
_provided __,_ _however __,_ that (i) no investigation pursuant to this
_Section 5.04_ shall modify or qualify any representation or warranty given
by any Party hereunder and (ii) notwithstanding the provision of information
or investigation by any Party, no Party shall be deemed to make
any representation or warranty except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) no Party shall be required to
provide any information which it determines in good faith it may not provide
to the other Party by reason of applicable Law (including any information in
confidential personnel files), which such Party determines in good faith
constitutes information protected by attorney/client privilege or which it is
required to keep confidential by reason of Contracts with third parties and
(B) no Party shall be required to provide access to any of its properties if
such access would result in damage to such property or if such access is for
the purpose of performing 

 



58  any onsite procedure or investigation (including any Phase II or other
onsite environmental investigation or study but not including any Phase I
environmental investigation or other environmental investigation that does
not include any sampling or testing), without that Partys written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
Parties shall make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions in clauses (A) and
(B) of the preceding sentence apply. Each of Entergy and ITC agrees that it
shall not, and shall cause its respective Representatives not to, use
any information obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.04_ for any purpose
unrelated to the Transactions and operation of the Transmission Business. The
Parties hereby agree that the Confidentiality Agreements shall govern all
information provided to them or their respective officers, directors,
employees or Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions.

Section 5.05 _Preparation of SEC Filings_.

(a) As promptly as practicable following the provision of the Audited
Financial Statements contemplated by _Section 5.03_, to the extent such
filings are required by applicable Law, Entergy and ITC shall jointly prepare,
and (i) ITC shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4
(together with any amendments, prospectuses or supplements thereto, the " _ITC
Form S-4_ ") to register the shares of ITC Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger, and a proxy statement (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the ITC Shareholder Approval,
(ii) TransCo shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form 10/S-4
or a registration statement on Form S-1/S-4, as applicable (either, and
together with any amendments, supplements, prospectus or information
statements thereto, the " _TransCo Registration Statements_ ") to register the
TransCo Common Units to be distributed in the Distribution, (iii) promptly
after the ITC Form S-4 and the TransCo Registration Statements have been
declared effective, Entergy shall file with the SEC a Schedule TO (together
with any amendments thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") if Entergy elects to
effect the Distribution in whole or in part by means of an Exchange Offer and
(iv) the Parties shall file such other appropriate documents with the SEC as
may be applicable.

 

(b) Each of Entergy and ITC shall use their reasonable best efforts to have
the TransCo Registration Statements, the ITC Form S-4 and other registration
statements as may be required declared effective under the Exchange Act or
Securities Act, as applicable, as promptly as practicable after such filing.
ITC shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to ITCs shareholders on a date mutually agreed after the TransCo
Registration Statements and the ITC Form S-4 are declared effective under the
Securities Act.

 

(c) Entergy shall furnish all information concerning Entergy and TransCo, and
ITC shall furnish all information concerning ITC and Merger Sub, as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action and the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement, the ITC Form S-4, the TransCo
Registration Statements and the Schedule TO. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Proxy Statement or the ITC Form S-4 shall be made by ITC,
no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the TransCo Registration
Statements shall be made by TransCo and no filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Schedule TO shall be made by Entergy, in each case without
providing the other Parties a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon.

 



59 (d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating
to Entergy or ITC or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors should be discovered by Entergy or ITC which should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to any of the Proxy Statement, the ITC Form S-4,
the TransCo Registration Statements or the Schedule TO, so that any such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated
to the applicable shareholders.

(e) The Parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, the ITC Form S-4, the
TransCo Registration Statements or the Schedule TO or for additional
information and shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence
between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its
staff, on the other hand, with respect thereto and shall give the other
Parties a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any proposed
response or compliance with any such request and thereafter shall respond as
promptly as practicable to any such comments or requests.

Section 5.06 _ITC Shareholder Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as practicable following the provision of the Audited
Financial Statements contemplated by _Section 5.03_ and the date on which the
SEC shall clear (whether orally or in writing) the Proxy Statement, in
compliance with applicable Law, ITC shall establish a record date for, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "
_ITC Shareholder Meeting_ ") for purposes which shall include obtaining the
ITC Shareholder Approval. ITC may adjourn or postpone the ITC Shareholder
Meeting (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment
to the Proxy Statement that it determines in good faith is required by
applicable Law is disseminated, (ii) if, as of the date and time on which the
ITC Shareholder Meeting is originally scheduled to be held, there are
insufficient shares of ITC Common Stock represented (either in person or
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the ITC
Shareholder Meeting or (iii) if, as of the date and time on which the ITC
Shareholder Meeting is originally scheduled to be held, postponing or
adjourning of the ITC Shareholder Meeting is necessary to enable ITC to
solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes in favor of the
ITC Shareholder Approval.

(b) Subject to _Section 5.07_, the Board of Directors of ITC shall recommend
that ITCs shareholders give the ITC Shareholder Approval, and such
recommendation shall be set forth in the Proxy Statement.

Section 5.07 _No Solicitation by ITC_.

(a) ITC agrees that, following the date of this Agreement and prior to the
earlier of the Effective Time or the Termination Date, neither it nor any of
its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective officers, directors or
employees, shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and their respective Representatives not to (and shall not

 



60  authorize or permit its and their respective Representatives to), directly
or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, seek or knowingly encourage (including
by way of furnishing information) or knowingly take any other action designed
to facilitate any inquiries or the making, submission or announcement of any
ITC Takeover Proposal, (ii) furnish any nonpublic information regarding ITC or
any of its Subsidiaries to any Person (other than Entergy) in connection with
or in response to an ITC Takeover Proposal, (iii) engage or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Entergy) with respect
to any ITC Takeover Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any ITC
Takeover Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle or other agreement providing for any ITC Takeover Transaction
(except as contemplated by _Section 7.01(h)_);  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this _Section 5.07_ shall not prohibit (A) ITC, or the Board of
Directors of ITC, directly or indirectly through any officer, employee or
Representative, prior to the receipt of the ITC Shareholder Approval, from
furnishing nonpublic information regarding ITC or any of its Subsidiaries to,
or entering into or participating in discussions or negotiations with, any
Person in response to an unsolicited, bona fide written ITC Takeover Proposal
that the Board of Directors of ITC concludes in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors, constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to an
ITC Superior Proposal if (1) the Board of Directors of ITC concludes in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action with respect to such ITC Takeover Proposal would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the exercise by the Board of
Directors of its duties under applicable Laws, (2) such ITC Takeover Proposal
did not result from a material breach of this _Section 5.07(a)_, (3) ITC
gives to Entergy the notice required by _Section 5.07(b)_ and (4) ITC
furnishes any nonpublic information provided to the maker of the ITC Takeover
Proposal only pursuant to a confidentiality agreement between ITC and such
Person on terms no less favorable to ITC than the Confidentiality Agreement (
_provided_ , _however_ , that such confidentiality agreement shall not in any
way restrict ITC from complying with its disclosure obligations under this
Agreement, including with respect to such proposal), and such furnished
information is delivered to Entergy at substantially the same time (to the
extent such information has not been previously furnished or made available by
ITC to Entergy) or (B) ITC from taking and disclosing to the ITC Shareholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act with regard to any ITC Takeover Proposal, _provided_ , _however_
, that compliance with such rules shall not in any way limit or modify the
effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules has under any
other provision of this Agreement and in no event shall ITC or the Board of
Directors of ITC or a committee thereof take any action that would constitute
an ITC Change of Recommendation in respect of an ITC Takeover Proposal other
than in compliance with  _Section 5.07(d)_.

(b) ITC shall promptly, and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours
after its receipt of any ITC Takeover Proposal, or any first request for
nonpublic information relating to ITC or any Subsidiaries in connection with
an ITC Takeover Proposal, advise Entergy orally and in writing of such ITC
Takeover Proposal or request, and, (x) if it is in writing, a copy of such
ITC Takeover Proposal and any related draft agreements and (y) if oral, a
reasonably detailed summary of any such ITC Takeover Proposal that is made or
submitted by any Person during the period between the date hereof and the
Closing. ITC shall (i) keep Entergy informed in all material respects on a
prompt basis with respect to any change to the status or material terms of any
such ITC Takeover Proposal (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours
following any such change) and (ii) provide to Entergy as soon as practicable
after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all material correspondence
and other written material sent or provided to ITC from any third party in
connection with any ITC Takeover Proposal or sent or provided by ITC to any
third party in connection with any ITC Takeover Proposal.

 



61 (c) Upon the execution of this Agreement, ITC shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors and
employees, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any discussions
existing as of the date of this Agreement between ITC or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
Representatives and any Person (other than Entergy) that relate to any ITC
Takeover Proposal and, to the extent provided by the applicable
confidentiality agreement or similar agreement governing such discussions,
require any third party to such discussions to return to ITC or to destroy all
confidential information of ITC and its Subsidiaries. ITC agrees not to, and
to cause its Subsidiaries not to, waive, or otherwise release any third party
from, the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which
ITC or any of its Subsidiaries is or may become a party.

 

(d) Except as contemplated by this _Section 5.07(d)_, neither the Board of
Directors of ITC nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify, or resolve to or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify the ITC Recommendation in a manner adverse to Entergy, (B)
make any other public statement in connection with the ITC Shareholder
Meeting or this Agreement, the Other Transaction Agreements or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby inconsistent with the ITC
Recommendation, (C) approve, adopt or recommend any ITC Takeover Proposal or
(D) fail to reaffirm or re-publish the ITC Recommendation within ten (10)
Business Days of being requested by Entergy to do so ( _provided __,_
_however_ , that Entergy shall not be entitled to request such
a reaffirmation or re-publishing more than one (1) time with respect to any
single ITC Takeover Proposal other than in connection with an amendment to the
financial terms of such ITC Takeover Proposal or any other material amendment
to such ITC Takeover Proposal) (each such action set forth in clauses (A)
through (D) above being an " _ITC Change of Recommendation_ ") or (ii)
approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or
recommend, a merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle,
share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, share exchange agreement,
option agreement or other similar contract (other than the confidentiality
agreement referred to in  _Section 5.07(a)_) or any tender offer providing
for, with respect to, or in connection with any ITC Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this _Section 5.07_, the
Board of Directors of ITC may at any time prior to receipt of the ITC
Shareholder Approval (i) make an ITC Change of Recommendation and (ii)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(h)_, if (and only if) (A)
an ITC Takeover Proposal is made to ITC by a third party, and such offer is
not withdrawn, (B) the Board of Directors of ITC determines in good faith
after consultation with its financial advisors that such offer constitutes an
ITC Superior Proposal, (C) following consultation with outside legal counsel,
the Board of Directors of ITC determines that the failure to make an ITC
Change of Recommendation, or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.01(h)_ of this Agreement, would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with the exercise of its duties under applicable Laws and (D) the Board of
Directors of ITC has provided to Entergy five (5) Business Days prior written
notice of its intent to effect an ITC Change of Recommendation (which notice
shall include the reasonable details regarding the cause for, and nature of,
the ITC Change of Recommendation) and, if requested by Entergy, negotiated in
good faith with Entergy during 

 



62  such five (5) Business Day period regarding revisions to this Agreement
proposed by Entergy. The Board of Directors of ITC may not make an ITC Change
of Recommendation in a manner adverse to Entergy except in compliance in all
respects with this _Section 5.07(d)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that a public
disclosure by ITC or the Board of Directors of ITC or any committee thereof
limited to a factual description of information that ITC or the Board of
Directors in its respective reasonable judgment determines is required to be
disclosed by applicable Law shall not constitute an ITC Change of
Recommendation and shall not be prohibited by this  _Section 5.07(d)_. For
the avoidance of doubt, a change of the ITC Recommendation to "neutral" is an
ITC Change of Recommendation.

(e) As used in this Agreement:

(i) " _ITC Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide offer, inquiry,
proposal or indication of interest received from a third party (other than an
offer, inquiry, proposal or indication of interest by a Party to this
Agreement) relating to any ITC Takeover Transaction;

(ii) " _ITC Takeover Transaction_ " shall mean any transaction or series of
related transactions involving: (a) any merger, consolidation, share
exchange, recapitalization, business combination or similar transaction
involving ITC other than the Transactions; (b) any direct or indirect
acquisition of securities, tender offer, exchange offer or other similar
transaction in which a Person or " _Group_ " (as defined in the Exchange Act)
of Persons directly or indirectly acquires beneficial or record ownership of
securities representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of any class of equity
securities of ITC; (c) any direct or indirect acquisition of any business or
businesses or of Assets that constitute or account for fifteen percent (15%)
or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or Assets of ITC and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (d) any liquidation or dissolution of ITC
or any of its Subsidiaries; and

(iii) " _ITC Superior Proposal_ " shall mean an ITC Takeover Proposal to
acquire at least a majority of the outstanding equity securities or assets of
ITC on terms that the Board of Directors of ITC determines, in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor,
is more favorable, from a financial point of view, to ITCs shareholders than
the Transactions (including any proposed modifications to the Transactions
which are committed to in writing by Entergy) and is reasonably likely to be
consummated, taking into account all factors deemed relevant by the ITC Board
of Directors, which may include (a) all financial considerations
and financial aspects of such ITC Takeover Proposal and the Transactions, (b)
all strategic considerations, including whether such ITC Takeover Proposal is
more favorable from a long-term strategic standpoint, (c) all legal and
regulatory considerations of such ITC Takeover Proposal and the Merger and
other Transactions, (d) the identity of the third party making such ITC
Takeover Proposal, (e) the conditions and likelihood of completion of such ITC
Takeover Proposal as compared to the Merger and other Transactions (taking
into account any necessary regulatory approvals), (f) whether such ITC
Takeover Proposal is likely to impose material obligations on ITC (or the
post-closing entity in which ITCs shareholders will hold securities) in
connection with obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, (g) whether such ITC
Takeover Proposal is subject to a financing condition and the likelihood of
such ITC Takeover Proposal being financed and (h) the payment of any ITC
Termination Fee, if relevant.

 



63 Section 5.08 _No Solicitation by Entergy of Transmission Business_. Entergy
agrees that, following the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of
the Effective Time or the Termination Date, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective officers, directors or employees,
shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their respective Representatives not to (and shall not authorize or permit its
and their respective Representatives to), directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,
initiate, seek or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
information) or knowingly take any other action designed to facilitate any
inquiries, proposals or offers from any Person relating to, (ii) furnish any
nonpublic information to any Person (other than ITC) regarding, (iii) engage
or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than
ITC) with respect to, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any action relating
to or (v) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle or other
agreement providing for, in each case, any purchase, transfer or other
disposition of all or any part of the Transmission Business, any merger,
consolidation, business combination, acquisition, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, or similar transaction involving the Transmission
Business, or the sale of all or any part of the Assets of the Transmission
Business (other than Assets sold in accordance with _Section 4.01(c)_).

 

Section 5.09 _NYSE Listing_. ITC shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the shares of ITC Common Stock to be issued in connection with the
Merger to be listed on the NYSE as of the Effective Time, subject to official
notice of issuance.

 

Section 5.10 _Required Amendments_. The Parties shall cooperate and negotiate
in good faith with respect to any amendment to this Agreement or the Other
Transaction Agreements reasonably requested by a Party in order to enable its
counsel to deliver the written opinion(s) contemplated by _Section 6.02_ or
_Section 6.03_ of this Agreement or for Entergy to obtain the Ruling, as the
case may be (any such amendment, a " _Proposed Amendment_ "). Neither Party
shall withhold its consent to a Proposed Amendment that (i) does not result in
any change in the Merger Consideration (except as otherwise contemplated by
this Agreement), (ii) is not adverse to the interests of any Party and (iii)
does not unreasonably impede or delay consummation of the Transactions in any
material respect. Any Proposed Amendment that the Parties consent to shall be
reflected through the execution of appropriate written amendments to the
applicable agreement.

 

Section 5.11 _[Intentionally omitted]_

Section 5.12 _ITC Guarantee; Indemnification_. Following the Effective Time,
ITC unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably guarantees to Entergy the
prompt payment, in full, when due, of any payment obligations of TransCo or
the TransCo Subs under the Separation Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
after the Closing and the prompt performance, when due, of all other
obligations of TransCo or any TransCo Sub under the Separation Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements after the Closing. ITCs obligations to Entergy under
this _Section 5.12_ are referred to as the " _Guaranteed Obligations_." The
Guaranteed Obligations are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and
ITC hereby expressly waives to the extent permitted by Law, any defense to its
obligations under this _Section 5.12_ any circumstance whatsoever which
might 

 



64  otherwise constitute a legal or equitable defense available to, or discharge
of, a surety or a guarantor, including without limitation, any right to
require or claim that Entergy seek recovery directly from TransCo or a
TransCo Sub in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, ITC reserves to itself all rights, setoff, counterclaims and other

Section 5.13 _Non-Opposition_. After the FERC Construct is initially set in
the FERC Approvals, and for a period of five (5) years after the Closing
Date, Entergy shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to), oppose,
contest, challenge or file any complaint before FERC or the Commissions
regarding, or take (publicly or otherwise) any position with any third Person
adverse to, the FERC Construct, unless (i) required by a Governmental
Authority pursuant to applicable Law, (ii) unanimously directed by the ERSC or
(iii) requested in writing by an act of the commissioners of any

approved by the Acceptable RTO of which the Transmission Business will become
a member, for anticipated capital expenditures that are included in the
capital expenditure plan as described in Section 5.13 of the ITC Disclosure
Letter, and recovery thereon, through the FERC Construct, unless and to the
extent (i) required by a Governmental Authority pursuant to applicable Law,
(ii) such plan is opposed by all of the members of the ERSC or (iii)
requested in writing by an act of the commissioners of any Entergy Retail
Regulator, _provided_ , _however_ , that this prohibition does not apply to
the extent that TransCo or ITC departs from such plan in any material
respect.

Section 5.14 _Disclosure Controls_. Each of ITC and Entergy shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to enable ITC to implement such programs and
take such steps as are reasonably necessary to (i) develop a system of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) intended to ensure that after the Effective
Time material information relating to the Surviving Company is timely made
known to the management of the Surviving Company by others within the entities
constituting the Surviving Company, (ii) cooperate reasonably with each other
in preparing for the transition and integration of the financial reporting
systems of TransCo and the TransCo Subs with ITCs financial reporting systems

Section 5.15 _Tax Matters_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
Entergy shall submit to the IRS the Ruling Request for the Ruling. The initial
Ruling Request and any supplemental materials submitted to the IRS relating
thereto (each, an " _IRS Submission_ ") shall be prepared by Entergy in
consultation with ITC, and, at ITCs request, ITC shall be a party to the
Ruling. In addition, Entergy shall, to the extent reasonably practicable,
provide ITC with an opportunity to review and comment on each IRS Submission
prior to the filing of such IRS Submission with the IRS; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Entergy need not provide ITC with an opportunity to comment
on a given IRS Submission if Entergy has reasonably determined that an adverse
effect would result from delaying such IRS Submission and ITC fails to provide
Entergy with comments on such IRS Submission within three (3) Business Days
of receipt thereof by ITC.

 



65 (b) Entergy shall provide ITC with copies of each IRS Submission as
filed with the IRS promptly following the filing thereof. Each of Entergy and
TransCo agrees to use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Ruling and the
other rulings set forth in the Ruling Request, including providing such
appropriate information and representations as the IRS shall require in
connection with the Ruling Request and any IRS Submissions, and ITC shall
reasonably cooperate with Entergy and TransCo in obtaining such rulings;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Entergy nor ITC shall be required to
modify the corporate structuring steps of the Transactions if to do so would
alter the economic arrangement of the Parties as set forth in this Agreement
and the Separation Agreement. Solely for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this _Section 5.15(b)_ shall provide grounds for Entergy, TransCo, or ITC to
alter any obligation or limitation imposed upon it under this Agreement or the
Other Transaction Agreements.

 

(c) Each of Entergy and TransCo agrees to use reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Tax Opinion, and ITC shall reasonably cooperate with Entergy and
TransCo in obtaining such opinion; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
Entergy nor ITC shall be required to modify the corporate structuring steps of
the Transactions if to do so would alter the economic arrangement of the
Parties as set forth in this Agreement and the Separation Agreement. In
rendering the Tax Opinion, counsel shall be permitted to rely upon and assume
the accuracy of customary representations provided by (A) ITC and Merger Sub
and (B) Entergy; _provided_ , _however_ , that Entergy shall not make any
representation that will affect either TransCo or ITC on or after the date of
the Distribution without the prior written consent of ITC.

 

(d) Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, all matters related to
the Ruling, Ruling Request and IRS Submissions are governed solely by this
_Section 5.15_.

Section 5.16 _Alternative Transaction Structures_. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement, the Parties may mutually agree that an
alternative transaction structure is preferable with respect to certain
aspects of this Transaction, in which case the Parties shall work together in
good faith to negotiate a definitive transaction agreement that reflects such
mutually agreed alternative structure. Without limiting the express rights of
the Parties contained in this Agreement (including the conditions precedent
and termination rights hereunder), Entergy and ITC agree to reasonably
cooperate in good faith in the consideration and implementation of alternative
structures in the event that any particular Non-FERC Approvals are not
obtained (or not obtainable on terms and conditions acceptable to the Parties
as contemplated by the provisions of this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no Party shall be required to take any action pursuant to this _Section
5.16_ if the other Party or Parties is in material breach of this Agreement
or any Other Transaction Agreement.

then capable of being satisfied (other than the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.01(f)_,  _Section 6.01(h)_, _Section 6.02(g)_ (to the extent

Approvals)), the Outside Date may be extended by Entergy or ITC by written

70   _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 7.01(b)_ shall not be available to a Party if the failure of the

terminating Party must have complied with its obligations hereunder to

obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate under this 
_Section 7.01(d)_ shall not be available to ITC where the failure to obtain
the ITC Shareholder Approval shall have been caused by ITCs material breach
of this Agreement;

 

(e) by ITC, if Entergy shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement or the Separation Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform (i) would result in a failure of a condition set
forth in _Section 6.01_ or _Section 6.02_ or in the Separation Agreement
and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured prior to the earlier to occur of (A)
sixty (60) calendar days after the giving of written notice referred to in the

(f) by Entergy, if ITC shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement or the Separation Agreement, which

forth in _Section 6.01_ or _Section 6.03_ or in the Separation Agreement and
(ii) cannot be or has not been cured prior to the earlier to occur of (A)
sixty (60) calendar days after the giving of written notice referred to in
the following proviso or (B) the Outside Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that

5.07_, which breach cannot be or has not been cured prior to the earlier to
occur of (A) ten (10) calendar days after the giving of written notice
referred to in the following proviso or (B) the Outside Date, _provided_ ,

order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (which the terminating
Party must have complied with its obligations hereunder to resist, resolve or
lift) permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting any material
component of the transactions hereunder or imposing an Entergy
Burdensome Condition, and such order, decree, ruling or other action becomes
final and non-appealable, _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
pursuant to this _Section 7.01(j)_ shall not be available if Entergys
failure to perform any of its obligations under _Section 5.01_ resulted in
such order, decree or ruling; and

 

(k) by ITC, if Entergy takes any action without the prior written consent of
ITC that would reasonably be expected to cause an RTO Adverse Impact.

In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7.01_, this Agreement shall terminate (except for the provisions of the last
two sentences of _Section 5.04_, _Section 7.02_, _Section 8.02_, _Section
8.04_, _Section 8.05_, _Section 8.06_ and  _Section 8.09_), and, subject
to _Section 7.02_, there shall be no other liability on the part of ITC or
Entergy to the other except under such provisions, liability arising out of
fraud or an intentional breach of this Agreement or the Separation Agreement
or as provided for in the Confidentiality Agreements, in which case the
aggrieved Party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law
or in equity.

 

Section 7.02 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) Entergy and ITC agree that (i) if this Agreement is terminated by (A)
Entergy pursuant to _Section 7.01(i)_ or (B) ITC pursuant to _Section
7.01(h)_ or (ii) (A) if this Agreement is terminated by Entergy pursuant to
_Section 7.01(g)_, or by ITC or Entergy pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)_, (B)
prior to any such termination, any Person (other than Entergy or
its Affiliates) shall have made an ITC Takeover Proposal which shall have
been publicly announced or disclosed and not publicly withdrawn or abandoned
by such Person at least five (5) Business 

 



72  Days prior to the ITC Shareholder Meeting, and (C) within twelve (12) months
after such termination of this Agreement, ITC shall have entered into an
agreement to consummate, or shall have consummated, an ITC Takeover
Transaction, then ITC shall pay to Entergy the ITC Termination Fee as
liquidated damages. The ITC Termination Fee shall be paid to Entergy by ITC in
immediately available funds (x) upon termination of this Agreement in the
case of a termination pursuant to clause (i)(B) above, (y) within five (5)
Business Days after termination in the case of a termination pursuant to
clause (i)(A) above and (z) upon the execution of or entrance into
a definitive agreement with respect to an ITC Takeover Transaction in the
case of a termination pursuant to clause (ii) above.

(b) Solely for purposes of this _Section 7.02_, " _ITC Takeover Transaction_
" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in _Section 5.07_, except that all
references to "fifteen percent (15%) or more" shall be changed to "more than
fifty percent (50%)."

Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and
obligations contained in this _Section 7.02_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these covenants
and obligations, the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement and
that the ITC Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Entergy and TransCo in the
circumstances in which such ITC Termination Fee is payable for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement, the Separation Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision. Upon payment of the ITC Termination Fee in accordance with
this _Section 7.02_, none of ITC, Merger Sub and any of their respective
former, current or future Affiliates or Representatives shall have any
further liability to Entergy, TransCo or their respective shareholders with
respect to this Agreement or the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Entergy shall have the right to elect in writing to sue for damages arising
out of ITCs intentional breach of this Agreement in lieu of (and prior to)
payment of the ITC Termination Fee in circumstances in which the ITC
Termination Fee would otherwise be payable, and upon such election in
writing, Entergy shall no longer be entitled to payment of the ITC Termination
Fee; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing herein shall release ITC from
liability for fraud. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall
ITC be required to pay the ITC Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

74 Section 8.05 _Specific Performance; Jurisdiction_. The Parties understand
and agree that the covenants and agreements on each of their parts herein
contained are uniquely related to the desire of the Parties and their
respective Affiliates to consummate the Transactions, that the Transactions
are a unique business opportunity at a unique time for each of Entergy and
ITC and their respective Affiliates, and further agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms and further agree that,
although monetary damages may be available for the breach of such covenants
and agreements, monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy therefor. It is
accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy that may
be available to it, including monetary damages, each of the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal
court within the State of Delaware). Each of the Parties further agrees that
no Party to this Agreement shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any
bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining
any remedy referred to in this  _Section 8.05_ and each Party waives any
objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have to require
the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.
In addition, each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that
any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights
and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder brought by the other Party hereto or its successors or assigns,
shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if
the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware).
Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action
or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees
not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in
any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that
it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for
any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section
8.05_, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding
is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts.

 



75 Section 8.06 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES

Party to the other Party in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
8.07_. Any notice to Entergy shall be deemed notice to all members of the
Entergy Group, and any notice to TransCo shall be deemed notice to all members
of the TransCo Group.

 

Section 8.08 _Amendments and Waivers_.

(a) This Agreement may be amended and any provision of this Agreement may be
waived, _provided_ , _however_ , that any such waiver shall be binding upon a
Party only if such waiver is set forth in a writing executed by such Party
and any such amendment shall be effective only if set forth in a writing
executed by each of the Parties. No course of dealing between or among any
Persons having any interest in this Agreement shall be deemed effective to
modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or any rights or
obligations of any Party under or by reason of this Agreement.

(b) No delay or failure in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall affect or operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
such a right, power or remedy preclude any further exercise thereof or of any
other right, power or remedy. The rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative
and not exclusive of any rights or remedies that any Party would otherwise
have. Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character of any
breach or default under this Agreement or any such waiver of any provision of
this Agreement must satisfy the conditions set forth in  _Section 8.08(a)_
and shall be effective only to the extent in such writing specifically set
forth.

 

Section 8.09 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is solely for the
benefit of the Parties and does not confer on third parties (including any
employees of any member of the Entergy Group or the TransCo Group) any remedy,
claim, reimbursement, claim of action or other right in addition to those
existing without reference to this Agreement.

 

Section 8.10 _Assignability; Binding Effect_. This Agreement is not assignable
by any Party without the prior written consent of the other Parties and any
attempt to assign this Agreement without such consent shall be void and of no
effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

Section 8.11 _Construction; Interpretation_. Headings of the Articles and
Sections of this Agreement are for convenience of the Parties only and shall
be given no substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of
contents to this Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever required
by the context, any pronoun used in this Agreement or the Entergy Disclosure
Letter or ITC Disclosure Letter shall include the corresponding masculine,
feminine or neuter forms, and the singular forms of nouns, pronouns and verbs
shall include the plural and vice versa. Reference to any agreement, document,
or instrument means such agreement, document, or instrument as amended or
otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof, and
if applicable hereof. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are

 



78  used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The Parties
have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement
and the Other Transaction Agreements. In the event an ambiguity or question
of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 8.12 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.

 

Section 8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts (any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than
one Party), each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement,
and any amendments hereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or other electronic transmission, shall be treated in all
manner and respects as an original agreement and shall be considered to have
the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of any Party, the other Party
shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to the requesting
Party. No Party shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or other electronic
means to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature was transmitted
or communicated through the use of facsimile machine or other electronic means
as a defense to the formation of a Contract and each such Party forever waives
any such defense.

 

Section 8.14 _Disclosure Letters_. There may be included in the Entergy
Disclosure Letter and/or the ITC Disclosure Letter items and information that
are not "material," and such inclusion shall not be deemed to be an
acknowledgment or agreement that any such item or information (or any non-
disclosed item or information of comparable or greater significance) is
"material," or to affect the interpretation of such term for purposes of this
Agreement. Matters reflected in the Entergy Disclosure Letter and ITC
Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited to matters required by this
Agreement to be disclosed therein. The Entergy Disclosure Letter and ITC
Disclosure Letter set forth items of disclosure with specific reference to the
particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information in
the Entergy Disclosure Letter and ITC Disclosure Letter, as applicable,
relates; _provided_ , _however_ , that any information set forth in one
Section of such disclosure letter shall be deemed to apply to each other
Section or subsection thereof to which its relevance is reasonably apparent
on its face.
