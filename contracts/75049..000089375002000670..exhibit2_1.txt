-vi-     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER,
dated as of November 3, 2002 (this "Agreement"), among General Electric
Company, a New York corporation ("Parent"), Oasis Acquisition, Inc., a
Minnesota corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger
Sub"), and Osmonics, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the "Company").  
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that it is
in the best interests of the Company and the shareholders of the Company and
declared it advisable to enter into this Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub
providing for the merger (the "Merger") of the Company with and into Merger
Sub in accordance with the Minnesota Business Corporation Act (the "MBCA"),
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and (ii)
resolved to recommend approval of this Agreement and the Merger by
the shareholders of the Company;   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub have each approved this Agreement pursuant to
which the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub in accordance with the
MBCA upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and  
WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  
THE MERGER   SECTION 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the MBCA, at the
Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub. As a
result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall
cease and Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving corporation of the
Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").   SECTION 1.2 Closing; Effective
Time. Subject to the provisions of Article VII, the closing of the Merger
(the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Simpson Thacher and
Bartlett, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, as soon as practicable,
but in no event later than the second business day after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (excluding conditions that,
by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing), or at such other
place or at such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree. The
date on which the Closing actually occurs is hereinafter referred to as the
"Closing Date". At the    Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger (the "Articles of
Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota, in such form
as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of
the MBCA (the date and time of the filing of the Articles of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota, or such later time as is
specified in the Articles of Merger and as is agreed to by the parties
hereto, being the "Effective Time") and shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the MBCA in connection with the Merger.   SECTION
1.3 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
applicable provisions of the MBCA. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 1.4 Articles of
Incorporation; By-Laws. (a) At the Effective Time and without any further
action on the part of the Company and Merger Sub, the articles of
incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended as provided therein and under the MBCA.   (b) At
the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of the Company
and Merger Sub, the by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with their terms or the articles
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as provided by law.  
SECTION 1.5 Directors and Officers. The directors of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall submit their resignations to be effective
as of the Effective Time. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the articles
of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until the earlier
of their resignation or removal or their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed (as the case may be) and qualified.   SECTION 1.6 Tax
Consequences. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this
Agreement will constitute a "plan of reorganization" for the purposes of
Section 368 of the Code.    2     ARTICLE II   EFFECT OF THE MERGER
ON THE CAPITAL STOCK  OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS   SECTION 2.1
Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of
any of the following securities:   (a) Subject to Sections 2.3 and 2.6(e),
each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the
"Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled
pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
2.5(a)) shall be converted into the right to receive the following (the
"Merger Consideration"):   (i) for each such share of Company Common Stock
with  respect to which an election to receive cash has  been effectively
made and not revoked or lost  pursuant to Section 2.2 (the "Electing
Company  Shares"), the right to receive $17.00 in cash (the  "Cash
Consideration"); and   (ii) for each such share of Company Common Stock
(other  than Electing Company Shares), the right to receive  a number of
validly issued, fully paid and  non-assessable shares of common stock, par
value  $0.06 per share, of Parent (the "Parent Common  Stock") equal to the
Cash Consideration, divided by  the Average Price (as defined below), subject
to  adjustment in accordance with Section 2.1(d) (the  "Exchange Ratio," and
together with any cash in lieu  of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
to be  paid pursuant to Section 2.6(e), the "Stock  Consideration"). The
"Average Price" means the  average of the Volume weighted sales prices per 
share of the Parent Common Stock on the New York  Stock Exchange, Inc. (the
"NYSE"), as reported by  Bloomberg Financial Markets (or if not reported 
thereby any other authoritative source as the  parties shall agree in
writing) for the ten  consecutive full trading days in which such shares 
are traded on the NYSE ending on the third trading  day prior to, but not
including, the Effective  Time. The Average Price shall be calculated to
the  nearest one-hundredth of one cent and the Exchange  Ratio shall be
calculated to the nearest  ten-thousandth.   (b) Each share of Company
Common Stock owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of such persons, in each case immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled and retired without any
conversion thereof and no stock of Parent, cash or other consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.   (c) Each share of common stock of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall remain outstanding and unchanged following the Effective Time as shares
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.    3     (d) If, after
determination of the Average Price and prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall pay a dividend in, subdivide, combine into a smaller number of shares
or issue by reclassification of its shares, any shares of Parent Common
Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be the number of shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding
immediately after, and the denominator of which shall be the number of such
shares outstanding immediately before, the occurrence of such event, and the
resulting product shall from and after the date of such event be the Exchange
Ratio, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this sentence.  
SECTION 2.2 Cash Elections. (a) Each person who, on or prior to the Election
Date (as defined below), is a record holder of shares of Company Common Stock
shall be entitled, with respect to all or any portion of such person\'s
shares, other than Dissenting Shares, to make an unconditional election (a
"Cash Election") on or prior to the Election Date to receive the Cash
Consideration, on the basis hereinafter set forth.   (b) Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company to act as
exchange agent hereunder (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares
of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") and shares of Company Common
Stock represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares").   (c) Parent shall
prepare a form of election (the "Form of Election"), which shall be subject
to the approval of the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld), and the Company shall mail or cause to be mailed the Form of
Election with the Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 3.12) to the record
holders of shares of Company Common Stock as of the record date for the
Shareholders Meeting. The Form of Election shall be used by each record
holder of shares of Company Common Stock (or, in the case of nominee record
holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and documentation)
who wishes to elect to receive cash for any or all shares of Company Common
Stock held by such holder, subject to the provisions of Section 2.3. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make the Form of Election
available to all persons who become holders of shares of Company Common Stock
during the period between the record date for the Shareholders Meeting and
the Election Date. Any holder\'s election to receive cash shall have been
properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have received at
its designated office, by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on (1) the date of
the Shareholders Meeting or (2) if the Closing Date is more than four
business days following the Shareholders Meeting, two business days preceding
the Closing Date (which Closing Date shall be publicly announced by Parent
and the Company by press release at least five business days prior to the
Closing Date) (the "Election Date"), a Form of Election properly completed
and signed and accompanied by (i) Certificates representing the shares of
Company Common Stock to which such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in
blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the
Company (or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates as
set forth in such Form of Election from a firm which is an "eligible
guarantor institution" (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")); provided that such
Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time set
forth in such guarantee of delivery) or (ii) in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, any additional documents specified in the procedures set forth in the
Form of Election. Any Form of Election may be revoked by the shareholder
submitting it only by written notice    4    received by the Exchange
Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Election Date. If a Form
of Election is revoked, the Certificate or Certificates (or guarantees of
delivery or Book-Entry Shares, as appropriate) for the shares of Company
Common Stock to which such Form of Election relates shall be promptly
returned by the Exchange Agent to the shareholder of the Company submitting
the same. For the avoidance of doubt, any shares of Company Common Stock with
respect to which there shall not have been submitted an effective, properly
completed Form of Election in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.2
(other than Dissenting Shares and shares canceled in accordance with Section
2.1(b)), shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration
in accordance with Section 2.1(a)(ii).   (d) The determination of the
Exchange Agent (or the mutual determination of the Company and Parent in the
event that the Exchange Agent declines to make any such determination) shall
be binding as to whether or not Cash Elections have been properly made or
revoked pursuant to this Section 2.2 with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock and as to when Cash Elections and revocations were received by it. If
the Exchange Agent reasonably determines in good faith that any Cash Election
was not properly made with respect to shares of Company Common Stock, such
shares shall be treated by the Exchange Agent as shares which were not
Electing Company Shares at the Effective Time, and such shares shall be
converted in the Merger into the right to receive the Stock Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii). The Exchange Agent (or the Company and Parent
by mutual agreement in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make any
such determination) shall also make all computations as to the allocation and
the proration contemplated by Section 2.3, and any such computation shall be
conclusive and binding on the shareholders of the Company. The Exchange Agent
may, with the mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent, make such
rules as are consistent with this Section 2.2 for the implementation of the
Cash Elections provided for herein and as shall be necessary or desirable to
fully effect such Cash Elections.   SECTION 2.3 Proration. (a) As promptly
as practicable following the Election Date, the Exchange Agent shall
calculate the allocation among holders of Company Common Stock of rights to
receive Parent Common Stock and cash in accordance with the Forms of Election
received and this Section 2.3.   (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the
"Maximum Cash Election Number" shall equal the number of Electing Company
Shares that, together with (i) the number of Dissenting Shares, if any, and
(ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger
Sub canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b), equals 55% of the number of
issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If the aggregate number of Electing Company Shares
exceeds the Maximum Cash Election Number, each Electing Company Share shall
be converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock or cash
in accordance with the terms of Section 2.1 in the following manner:   (i)
a proration factor (the "Cash Proration Factor")  shall be determined by
dividing the Maximum Cash  Election Number by the number of Electing
Company  Shares;   (ii) the number of Electing Company Shares covered by 
each Cash Election that will be converted into the  right to receive cash
shall be determined by    5     multiplying the Cash Proration Factor
by the total  number of Electing Company Shares covered by such  Cash
Election and rounding that result down to the  nearest whole share; and  
(iii) all Electing Company Shares, other than those  shares converted into
the right to receive cash  calculated in accordance with Section
2.3(b)(ii),  shall be converted into the right to receive shares  of Parent
Common Stock as if such shares were not  Electing Company Shares, in
accordance with the  terms of Section 2.1(b)(ii).   (c) Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3, the Maximum Cash Election Number
shall be reduced, (i) if the aggregate Cash Consideration with respect to
Electing Company Shares plus an amount equal to (x) the Cash Consideration
multiplied by (y) the sum of the number of Dissenting Shares, if any, and the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub
canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) (the product of (x) and (y) being
referred to as the "Other Shares Value") would represent more than 55% of the
fair market value of the aggregate Merger Consideration plus the Other Shares
Value (with the Stock Consideration being valued on the basis of the average
of the high and low prices of the Parent Common Stock as reported on the NYSE
Composite Transaction Tape on the Closing Date), to the minimum extent
necessary so that the aggregate Cash Consideration with respect to Electing
Shares plus the Other Shares Value equals 55% of the aggregate value of the
Merger Consideration plus the Other Shares Value or (ii) if otherwise
necessary to permit the delivery of the tax opinions referred to in Sections
7.2(d) and 7.3(e), to the minimum extent necessary to enable such opinions to
be rendered.   (d) To the extent practicable, the Form of Election shall
permit each holder that beneficially owns shares of Company Common Stock
and/or whose affiliates beneficially own shares of Company Common Stock, in
more than one name or account in the event that the aggregate of the Electing
Company Shares exceeds the Maximum Cash Election Number, to specify how to
allocate the cash paid and Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger among the
various accounts that such holder of Company Common Stock beneficially owns
and, with the requisite consent of such holder\'s affiliates, among the
accounts beneficially owned by such holder and its affiliates.   SECTION
2.4 Treatment of Options and other Share-based Company Plans. (a) At the
Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock held by any Company Employee (as defined in Section 3.10(a)) (an
"Option") which is outstanding and unexercised (whether or not exercisable)
immediately prior thereto shall (i) cease to represent a right to acquire
shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) be converted automatically into an
option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock, on the same terms and
conditions (to the extent practicable with respect to non-
substantive administrative procedures) as were available under the Option
(but taking into account any changes thereto, including the acceleration or
the exercisability thereof, provided for in the Company Stock Plans (as
defined in Section 3.3) or in such Option by reason of this Agreement or the
transaction contemplated hereby), (x) equal to such number of shares of
Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the Option by the Exchange Ratio (rounded, if
necessary, to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock or, for any
incentive    6    stock option under Section 422 of the Code, rounded
if necessary down to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock) and (y)
having a per share exercise price equal to the per share exercise price
specified in the Option divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounded, if necessary,
to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent); provided, however, that in the case
of any Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its
qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the number
of shares subject to such Option and the terms and conditions of exercise of
such Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements
of Section 424(a) of the Code.   (b) The Company shall take all action
reasonably necessary so that, effective as of the last day of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the Closing Date occurs, the Company
1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (as amended) (the "Stock Purchase Plan")
shall terminate and all participants in such plan shall be entitled to
receive a refund of all cash amounts in their accounts under such plan
promptly thereafter, all in accordance with the terms of the Stock Purchase
Plan.   (c) Parent shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares
of Parent Common Stock for delivery in accordance with this Section
2.4, including upon the exercise of options to purchase Parent Common Stock.
Parent shall file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) or
a post-effective amendment to a previously filed registration statement prior
to the Effective Time for purposes of registering all shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable after the Effective Time upon exercise of the options
to purchase Parent Common Stock that are issued in connection with the
Merger, and shall have such registration statement or post-effective
amendment become effective and comply, to the extent applicable, with state
securities or blue sky laws with respect thereto at the Effective Time.
Within a reasonable period of time after the Closing Date, Parent shall also
deliver to the holders of Options notices setting forth (i) the new number of
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Option and the new per share
exercise price calculated in accordance with this Section 2.4, and (ii)
changes, if any, to the non-substantive administrative procedures with
respect to the Option (including, without limitation, the procedures for
exercising the Option).   SECTION 2.5 Dissenting Shares. (a) Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock
that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
which are held by holders of shares of Company Common Stock who have not
voted in favor of or consented to the Merger and who have properly demanded
and perfected their rights to dissent from the Merger and to be paid the fair
value of such shares in accordance with Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the
MBCA (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof shall be entitled
to only such rights as are granted by the MBCA; provided, however, that if
any such shareholder of the Company shall fail to perfect or shall
effectively withdraw or lose such shareholder\'s right to dissent under the
MBCA, such shareholder\'s shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, as set forth in Section 2.1 of this
Agreement, without any interest thereon (and, if no election is timely made
by such holder pursuant to Section 2.2, into the Stock Consideration).   
7     (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) notice of any notice received
by the Company of intent to demand the fair value of any shares of Company
Common Stock, withdrawals of such notices and any other instruments served
pursuant to the MBCA and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of
dissenters\' rights under the MBCA. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by applicable law,
make any payment with respect to any such exercise of dissenters\' rights or
offer to settle or settle any such rights.   SECTION 2.6 Surrender of
Shares. (a) Prior to or as of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the shareholders of the Company, (i)
cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration and any
payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.6(e) and
(ii) sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock to make all exchanges pursuant
to Section 2.6(b). Any cash so deposited shall be invested by the Exchange
Agent as directed by Merger Sub or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation; provided that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor\'s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $500 million. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or
income produced by, such investments will be payable to Parent.   (b)
Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to
be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares (other than such holders who properly made an election to
receive cash with respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with Section 2.2(c) and other than Dissenting Shares), a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in
the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares for payment of
the Stock Consideration therefor. After the Effective Time, with respect to
properly made elections to receive cash for Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
in accordance with Section 2.2(c) or upon surrender, in accordance with this
Section 2.6(b), to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a new
certificate or new certificates (the "New Certificates") representing the
number of full shares of Parent Common Stock and/or cash (including any cash
payable in lieu of fractional shares), in each case, to be received by the
holder thereof pursuant to this Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall accept
such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions
as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. After the Effective Time, there
shall be no further transfer on the records of the Company or its transfer
agent of shares of Company Common Stock and, if Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Company for transfer, they shall be canceled
against delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration. If any New
Certificate is to be issued in, or if cash is to be remitted to, a   
8    name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered
for exchange is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed, with
signature guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the
person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Company or its transfer
agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of New
Certificates in, or remittance of cash to, a name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.6(b),
each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.1.   (c)
No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be received in respect thereof and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such
holder pursuant to Section 2.6(e), in each case until the surrender of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article II.
Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to the holder of the New
Certificate or New Certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in connection therewith, without interest, (i) at the time of
such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.6(e) and any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, any dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.   (d) The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of Article I and this Article II
(including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.6(e)) shall be deemed to have
been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock so exchanged.   (e) (i) No New Certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued in connection with the Merger and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder
of the Company after the Merger, and (ii) notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged
pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all
shares of Company Common Stock delivered by such holder) shall receive, in
lieu thereof, a cash payment (without interest rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled by the closing price for a share of
Parent Common Stock as reported on the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape on
the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Effective Time
occurs.   (f) At any time following the date which is twelve months after
the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent
to deliver to it any Parent Common    9    Stock or funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) which have been made available to
the Exchange Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors
thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of
the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares of Company
Common Stock for the Merger Consideration.   ARTICLE III  
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   The Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, except as set forth on
the company disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to the Parent and
Merger Sub prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule"):   SECTION 3.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. (a)
The Company and each of its subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization
and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
except where any such failures to be so organized, existing or in good
standing or to have such power or authority would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect
(as defined below). The Company and each of its subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except for any such failures to be so qualified or licensed or in
good standing which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. "Company Material
Adverse Effect" means any change, event, occurrence or effect that would be
materially adverse to the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than
any change or effect resulting from (i) changes in general economic
conditions, (ii) the announcement and performance of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the covenants set forth
herein or (iii) general changes or developments in the industries in which
the Company and its subsidiaries operate that do not have a materially
disproportionate effect (relative to other industry participants) on the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.   (b) Set forth in Section
3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule is a list of all subsidiaries of
the Company together with the jurisdiction of organization of each such
subsidiary and the percentage of each such subsidiary\'s outstanding capital
stock or other ownership interests owned, directly or indirectly, by the
Company. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries directly or
indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar
interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business
association or entity.    10     SECTION 3.2 Articles of Incorporation
and By-laws. The Company has heretofore furnished or otherwise provided to
Parent a complete and correct copy of its articles of incorporation and the
First Amended and Restated By-Laws (the "By-Laws") of the Company as
currently in effect and the certificates of incorporation, bylaws or all such
equivalent documents for each of the Company\'s subsidiaries (the "Subsidiary
Governing Documents"). The articles of incorporation of the Company and the
By-Laws are in full force and effect and no other organizational documents
are applicable to or binding upon the Company. The Company is not in
violation of any provisions of its articles of incorporation or By-Laws and
none of the Company\'s subsidiaries is in violation of any of the Subsidiary
Governing Documents.   SECTION 3.3 Capitalization. The authorized capital
stock of the Company consists of (i) 50,000,000 shares of Company Common
Stock and (ii) 500,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share
(the "Company Preferred Stock"). As of September 30, 2002, (i) 14,648,744
shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of which were
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and were issued free of
preemptive rights, (ii) 1,251,794 shares of Company Common Stock were

Plan (as amended) and the Company 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (as
amended) (collectively, the "Company Stock Plans") and (iii) no shares of
Company Preferred Stock were outstanding. Except as set forth in Section 3.3
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since September 30, 2002, no options to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock have been
granted and no shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock have been issued,
except (i) for shares of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to (A) the
exercise of Options, (B) the Company 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (as
amended) (in accordance with the Company\'s past practice with respect to
such plan) and (C) the Company 1995 Director Stock Option Plan (as amended)
(with respect to "restricted stock", as defined in such plan), or (ii) as

operations or engage in any business as of the date hereof, each of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the Company\'s subsidiaries is
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and all
such shares are owned by the Company or another wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company and are owned free and clear of all security interests, liens,
claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in voting rights, charges or
other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.    11     SECTION 3.4

power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and

Company Requisite Vote. The only vote of the shareholders of the Company
required to approve this Agreement and the Merger is the Company Requisite
Vote. The Board of Directors of the Company has approved and taken all
corporate action required to be taken by the Board of Directors for
the consummation by the Company of the Merger. As of the date hereof,
the Company\'s Board of Directors has adopted resolutions (i) approving
and declaring advisable this Agreement, determining that the Merger is
advisable and that the terms of the Merger are fair to, and in the best

and (v) of subsection (b) below have been obtained and all filings described
in such clauses have been made, conflict with or violate any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or by which its or any of their respective properties are bound
or (iii) result in any breach or violation of or constitute a default (or an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) or
result in the loss of a benefit under, or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration of, any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit or
other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
its or any of their respective properties are bound, except, in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults, losses, rights or other occurrences which would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (b)
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and
the consummation of the Merger by the Company do not and will not require any
consent,    12    approval, authorization or permit of, action by,
filing with or notification to, any governmental or regulatory authority,
federal, state or local court, administrative or regulatory agency or
commission or other federal, state, local or foreign governmental entity or

Agreement in any material respect or (B) have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.6 Compliance. (a)

None of the Company SEC Reports (including the financial statements contained
therein), when filed (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the

its subsidiaries as of the date hereof or under which the Company or any of
its subsidiaries has any liability ("Foreign Plans"), except for any such
failures to so establish, contribute to, sponsor, maintain or administer as
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. All contributions that have been required, pursuant to any Company

respect to each Company Plan or Foreign Plan, no investigations, audits,
actions, suits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits payable

pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened.   (f) Each Company
Plan intended to satisfy Section 401(a) of the Code has received from the IRS
a favorable determination letter with respect to the current form of such
Company Plan (except for any amendment with respect to which the remedial
amendment period in Section 401(b) of the Code is available), and nothing has
occurred since the date of the last determination which would reasonably be
expected to result in the revocation of such determination.   (g) Except as
provided under the terms of the Company Plans set forth in Section 3.1(g) of

3.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of the Company,
no claim for unpaid Taxes has been asserted against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries in writing by a Tax authority which, if resolved in a manner
unfavorable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be,
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   (d) There are no mortgages, pledges,
security interests, encumbrances, liens or charges of any kind (collectively

(including any related notes thereto) included in the Parent SEC Reports (the
"Parent SEC Financial Statements") fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Parent and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operation and cash flows for the respective periods set
forth therein, in each case, in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of
unaudited consolidated quarterly statements, (i) as permitted by Form 10-Q of
the SEC, (ii) as may be indicated in footnotes thereto or in the Parent SEC
Reports and (iii) that they are subject to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments).   (c) Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has incurred
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be reflected or
reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent prepared in
accordance with GAAP except (i) as and to the extent set forth on the audited
balance sheet of Parent and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001
(including the notes thereto), (ii) as incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) as incurred after December
31, 2001 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice,
(iv) as described in the Parent SEC Reports filed since December 31, 2001 but
prior to the date of this Agreement or (v) as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.   SECTION 4.6 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except
as contemplated by this Agreement and except as disclosed in the Parent
SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, since December 31,
2001, there has not been any change, event or occurrence which has had or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.7 Form S-4; Proxy Statement.
None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the
time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or
supplemented and at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading and (ii) the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is
first mailed to the shareholders of the Company and at the time of the
Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or   
27    necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Form S-4
will, as of its effective date, and the prospectus contained therein will, as
of its date, comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements
of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub make no
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by the
Company or any of its representatives which is contained or incorporated by
reference in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement.   SECTION 4.8 Brokers. No
broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder\'s
or other fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by and on behalf of Parent or
Merger Sub.   SECTION 4.9 Ownership of Shares. As of the date of this
Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates do not own
(directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record) any shares of Company
Common Stock and none of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective affiliates
hold any rights to acquire any shares of Company Common Stock except pursuant
to this Agreement.   SECTION 4.10 Vote/Approval Required. No vote or consent
of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary
to approve this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated
hereby. The vote or consent of Parent as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub
(which shall have occurred prior to the Effective Time) is the only vote or
consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub
necessary to approve this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby.   SECTION 4.11 Reorganization Qualification. Neither
Parent nor Merger Sub, nor to Parent\'s knowledge, any other affiliate of
Parent, has taken or agreed to take any action, or knows of any
circumstances, that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   ARTICLE

Business. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company\'s or its
subsidiaries\' operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its
subsidiaries\' operations.   ARTICLE VI   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS  
SECTION 6.1 Shareholders Meeting. (a) As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company, acting through its Board
of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof, shall (i) duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders for
the purpose of approving the Merger and this Agreement (the
"Shareholders Meeting") and (ii) subject to Section 6.5, (A) include in the
Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Board of Directors that the
shareholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval of the Merger and
this Agreement and, subject to the approval of the Financial Advisor, the
written opinion of the Financial Advisor, dated as of the date hereof that,
as of such date, the Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration, taken in
the aggregate, is fair to the holders of Company Common Stock from a
financial point of view and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
necessary approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the shareholders of
the Company.   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to hold the Shareholders
Meeting if this Agreement is terminated.   SECTION 6.2 Form S-4 and Proxy
Statement. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall, with the assistance and approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) of Parent, prepare the Proxy Statement and
Parent, with the assistance and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) of the Company, shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in
which the Proxy Statement shall be included as a prospectus. Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company will cooperate with each other in the preparation of the
Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub and the Company will furnish to each
other the information relating to it required by the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and the    30    rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder to be set forth in the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form
S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as soon as reasonably
practicable after it is filed with the SEC. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
shareholders of the Company as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form
S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take
any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in
connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the
Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company
as may be reasonably required in connection with any such action. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to correct any information provided
by it for use in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement which shall have become
false or misleading. Parent shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify
the Company of the effectiveness of the Form S-4, and each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify the other
of the receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4 or
the Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Form
S-4 or the Proxy Statement or for additional information.   SECTION 6.3
Resignation of Directors. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation of all
directors of the Company, effective at the Effective Time.   SECTION 6.4
Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) Subject to the limitations set
forth herein, from the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice, the
Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
subsidiaries, officers, directors and employees to, afford the
officers, employees, auditors, consultants and other authorized
representatives of Parent reasonable access, consistent with applicable law,
at all reasonable times to its officers, employees, properties, offices,
plants and other facilities (including, without limitation, until November
25, 2002, such access necessary for Parent and its representatives to conduct
Phase II or other environmental testing or samplings at the sites and in the
manner specified in the Environmental Access Agreement, dated the date
hereof, among Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (the "Environmental Tests"))
and to all books and records, and shall furnish Parent with all financial,
operating and other data and information as Parent through its officers,
employees or authorized representatives, may from time to time reasonably
request in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or
consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
subsidiaries. If Parent believes that any condition to closing of Parent and
Merger Sub contained in Article VII hereof would fail to be satisfied due
primarily to the results of the Environmental Tests, then Parent shall notify
the Company in writing as to such fact no later than December 2, 2002. If
Parent so notifies the Company that it believes that any such condition to
closing would fail to be satisfied due primarily to the Environmental Tests,
Parent shall provide such information with respect to such purported failure
as the Company reasonably requests. If Parent does not so notify the Company
that it believes that any such condition to closing would fail to be
satisfied due primarily to the Environmental Tests, then Parent and Merger
Sub shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to assert a failure
of any of the conditions in Article VII to be satisfied due primarily to the
Environmental Tests. Not later than December 2, 2002, Parent shall notify the
Company in writing of the estimate of the remediation costs and related   
31    expenses determined as a result of the Environmental Tests and
promptly following any request, such supporting documentation with respect
thereto as the Company shall reasonably request.   (b) Parent and Merger
Sub will hold and treat and will cause its officers, employees, auditors,
consultants and other authorized representatives to hold and treat in
confidence all documents and information concerning the Company and its
subsidiaries furnished to or obtained by Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable,
in connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement
(including, without limitation, any information obtained in connection with
the Environmental Tests) in accordance with the confidentiality agreement,
dated July 30, 2002, as amended as of August 8, 2002, between the Company and
Parent, which confidentiality agreement shall remain in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.   SECTION 6.5 Acquisition Proposals. (a) The
Company agrees that (i) it and its employees, officers and directors shall
not, (ii) its subsidiaries and its subsidiaries\' employees, officers and
directors shall not and (iii) it shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure
that its and its subsidiaries\' agents, accountants, consultants, financial
and other advisors, investment bankers, attorneys, and representatives
("Representatives") shall not, (A) directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit
or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer with respect to a tender offer or exchange offer, proposal
for a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the
Company and its subsidiaries or any proposal or offer, in each case, to
acquire in any manner 20% or more of the equity in the Company or any of its
material subsidiaries or 20% or more of the assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as
an "Acquisition Proposal") or (B) directly or indirectly, engage in any
negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide access to its properties,
books and records or any confidential information or data to, any person
relating to an Acquisition Proposal or which may reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of
Directors from (i) prior to the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by
the Company\'s shareholders by the Company Requisite Vote, providing access
to its properties, books and records and providing information or data in
response to a request therefor by a person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal not resulting from a breach of Section
6.5(a) if the Board of Directors receives from the person so requesting such
information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms substantially
similar to those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (except for such
changes specifically necessary in order for the Company to be able to comply
with its obligations under this Agreement), (ii) prior to the approval of the
Merger and this Agreement by the Company\'s shareholders by the Company
Requisite Vote, engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any person
who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
not resulting from a breach of Section 6.5(a) or (iii)(A) withdrawing,
modifying or changing in any adverse manner its approval or recommendation of
this Agreement or (B) recommending an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal; if and only if in connection with the foregoing
clauses, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with its legal counsel and financial advisors that
(x) in the case of clause (iii) above only, such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) in the case of clauses (i) and (ii)
above only, as a result of such actions, such Acquisition Proposal will
result in, or could reasonably be expected    32    to constitute or
result in, a Superior Proposal. The Company agrees that it will immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any persons conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall also (1) promptly (and in any event
within 48 hours) notify Parent of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal
after the date hereof, which notice shall include the identity of the person
making such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms thereof (including
any material modifications or amendment to such terms) and (2) keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status and details of any such proposal
or inquiry.   (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.5 to the
contrary, if, at any time prior to the approval of the Merger and this
Agreement by the Company\'s shareholders by the Company Requisite Vote, the
Company\'s Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, in response to an
Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited and that did not otherwise result
from a breach of Section 6.5(a), that such proposal is a Superior Proposal,
the Company or its Board of Directors may terminate this Agreement; provided,
however, that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
sentence, and any purported termination pursuant to this sentence shall be
void and of no force or effect, unless the Company prior to or concurrently
with such termination pursuant to this Section 6.5(b) pays to Parent the fee
payable pursuant to Section 8.2(b) and enters into a definitive agreement
concerning the Superior Proposal; and provided, further, however, that the
Company shall not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 6.5(b) until after three business days following Parent\'s
receipt of written notice (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the amount or form of
consideration of the Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new
three business day period) advising Parent that the Company\'s Board of
Directors intends to cause the Company to accept such Superior Proposal,
specifying the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal (it
being understood that neither the delivery of a notice of a Superior Proposal
nor any subsequent public announcement thereof shall constitute a violation
of Section 6.5(a) or entitle Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(e)) and that the Company shall, during such three business day
period, negotiate in good faith with Parent to make such adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal
would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal.   (c) Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 6.5 to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall
prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to
its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
shareholders required to be made by applicable statute, law, rule or
regulation in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or
exchange offer) or from making any legally required disclosure
to shareholders with regard to any Acquisition Proposal.   As used herein,
the term "Superior Proposal" shall mean an Acquisition Proposal to acquire
all of the equity interest in or all or substantially all of the assets of
the Company (on a consolidated basis) and which the Board of Directors of the
Company reasonably determines, in good faith after consultation with its
financial advisors and legal advisors taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, is more favorable to
the Company and its shareholders than the Merger and is reasonably capable of
being completed (including    33    with respect to the ability of such
third party to obtain any external financing). Reference in the foregoing
definition to the "Merger" shall include any proposed alteration of the terms
of this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent in response to such
Acquisition Proposal.   SECTION 6.6 Employment and Employee Benefits
Matters. (a) For a period of at least one year following the Effective Time
(such period of time, the "Protected Period"), Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates to provide to employees of the
Company pay (which shall include rates of base salary or wages and annual
bonus opportunities), benefits and benefit plans, programs and policies
(including, without limitation, severance benefits, medical and welfare
plans), which are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided
by the Company to the employees of the Company on the date hereof.
Notwithstanding anything set forth above, the participation of the employees
of the Company in any Parent\'s option or similar equity grant or purchase
programs or plans shall be subject to the eligibility requirements of such
programs or plans.   (b) Current employees of the Company shall also be
provided credit for all service with the Company and its subsidiaries, to the
same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by the Company and
its subsidiaries for such employees, under (i) all employee benefit plans,
programs, policies and fringe benefits arrangements to be provided to such
employees for purposes of eligibility and vesting, (ii) severance plans,
programs and policies to be provided to such employees for purposes of
calculating the amount of each such employee\'s severance benefits and (iii)
vacation and sick leave plans, programs and policies for purposes of
calculating the amount of each such employee\'s vacation and sick leave. With
respect to each employee benefit plan, program or policy of Parent that is a
"welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) in which current
employees of the Company participate following the Effective Time, the Parent
or its subsidiaries shall (A) cause there to be waived any pre-existing
condition or eligibility limitations and (B) give effect, in determining any
deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations payable during the plan year
in which the Effective Time occurs, to claims incurred and amounts paid by,
and amounts reimbursed to, current employees of the Company during such plan
year under similar plans maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (c) Parent will, or will cause
the Surviving Corporation to, assume and either will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, discharge the obligations under each employment or
severance agreement listed in Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.   (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this Section 6.6 shall impede or limit Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any of their affiliates from terminating any of their employees at
any time for any reason or no reason, subject to the provisions of applicable
law.   SECTION 6.7 Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and
Insurance. (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may
have under any employment agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time
through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and
hold harmless each present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer
or    34    director of the Company and its subsidiaries (the
"Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including, without limitation, attorneys\' fees and disbursements
(collectively, "Costs"), incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that the
Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries and (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including, without limitation, this Agreement and the
transactions and actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement
of expenses incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation from Parent or the Surviving Corporation within ten business
days of receipt by Parent from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor;
provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the MBCA, to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled
to indemnification.   (b) The articles of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or
present directors, officers and employees than are presently set forth in
the Company\'s articles of incorporation and By-laws, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any such individuals.   (c) Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in
effect for six years from the Effective Time the current policies of the
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company
(provided that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which
are not materially less advantageous to any beneficiary thereof) with respect
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, provided,
however, that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of the amount
specified in Section 6.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and provided,
further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
specified amount, Parent shall be obligated to obtain, or to cause the
Surviving Corporation to obtain, a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such specified amount.   (d) This
covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal
representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.   (e) In the event that the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in Section 6.6 and this Section 6.7.    35    
SECTION 6.8 Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws
and regulations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of
a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and to supply
as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act, to make any
additional filings required by any applicable Antitrust Law, and to take all
other actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the
approval of the Merger pursuant to the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws as
soon as practicable. Each of Parent and the Company (to the extent directed
by Parent) shall as promptly as practicable comply with the Foreign Antitrust
Laws.   (b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, in connection
with the efforts referenced in Section 6.8(a) to obtain all requisite
approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection
with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party
(including sharing copies of any such filings or submissions reasonably in
advance of the filing or submission thereof); (ii) keep the other party
informed of any communication received by such party from, or given by such
party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice (the "DOJ") or any other U.S. or foreign
governmental authority ("Governmental Authority") and of any communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii)
permit each of the other parties hereto to review in advance any
communication intended to be given by it to, and consult with the other
parties in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any
such other Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC,
the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Authority or other person, give
the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings
and conferences. For purposes of this Agreement, "Antitrust Law" means the
Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other federal, state and
foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and
judicial doctrines and other laws that are designed or intended to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization
or restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or
acquisition.   (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of
the parties contained in Sections 6.8(a) and (b), each party hereto shall use
its reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
Antitrust Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in connection with any filing or submission required or action to
be taken by either Parent or the Company to consummate the Merger, in no
event shall Parent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates be obligated to
propose or agree to accept any undertaking or condition, to enter into any
consent decree, to make any divestiture or accept any operational

Electric Company GE Power Systems  4200 Wildwood Parkway Atlanta, Georgia
30339 Attention: James M. Waterbury, Esq.  Ladies and Gentlemen:  
General Electric Company, a New York corporation ("Parent"),
Oasis Acquisition, Inc., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Osmonics, Inc., a Minnesota
corporation (the "Company") have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
dated as of November 3, 2002 (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger") whereby each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the
"Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) shall be converted into
the right to receive a number of shares of common stock, par value $0.06 per
share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") or a specified amount of cash. The
undersigned acknowledges that the undersigned may be deemed an "affiliate" of
the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 ("Rule 145") promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), although nothing contained herein should
be construed as an admission of such fact.   If, in fact, the undersigned
were such an affiliate under the Securities Act, the undersigned\'s ability
to sell, assign or transfer the shares of Parent Common Stock received by the
undersigned in the Merger may be restricted unless such transaction is
registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is
available. The undersigned understands that such exemptions are limited and,
to the extent the undersigned felt necessary, the undersigned has obtained
advice of counsel as to the nature and conditions of such exemptions,
including information with respect to the applicability to the sale of such
securities of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated under the Securities Act. The
undersigned understands that Parent is under no obligation to register Parent
Common Stock for sale, transfer or other disposition by the undersigned or
take any action to make compliance with an exemption from registration
available to the undersigned.   The undersigned hereby represents to and
covenants with Parent that the undersigned will not sell, assign, transfer or
otherwise dispose of any of the Parent Common Stock received (including
through a cashless exercise of stock options) by the undersigned in the
Merger except (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act, (ii) in conformity with the volume and other limitations of
Rule 145 or (iii) in a transaction which, in the written opinion of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to Parent or as described in a "no-action" or
interpretive letter from the Staff of the SEC specifically issued with
respect to a transaction to be engaged in by the undersigned, is not required
to be registered under the Securities Act.      In the event of a sale or
other disposition by the undersigned of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Rule
145, the undersigned will supply Parent with evidence of compliance with such
Rule, in the form of a letter in the form of Annex I hereto, a broker\'s
letter in customary form or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent
and its counsel and, to the extent required by the preceding paragraph, the
written opinion of counsel or no-action letter referred to in such paragraph.
The undersigned understands that Parent may instruct its transfer agent to
withhold the transfer of any shares of Parent Common Stock disposed of by the
undersigned, but that (provided such transfer is not prohibited by any other
provision of this letter agreement) upon receipt of such evidence of
compliance, Parent shall cause the transfer agent to effectuate the transfer
of the Parent Common Stock sold as indicated in such letter. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent shall revoke the stop transfer instructions with
respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock held by the undersigned or a
transferee of the undersigned as to which the legend referred to below has
been removed.   The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that the legend set
forth below will be placed on certificates representing any Parent Common
Stock received by the undersigned in connection with the Merger or held by a
transferee thereof, which legend will be removed by delivery of substitute
certificates (A) upon the transfer by the undersigned of Parent Common Stock
(i) if one year shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired the
Parent Common Stock received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule
145(d)(2) are then available to the undersigned, (ii) if two years shall have
elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired the Parent Common Stock
received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then
applicable to the undersigned or (iii) pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act or (B) upon receipt of an opinion in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent from independent counsel
(which may be Simpson Thacher and Bartlett) reasonably satisfactory to Parent
to the effect that such legends are no longer required for purposes of the
Securities Act.   There will be placed on the certificates for Parent Common
Stock issued to the undersigned in connection with the Merger, or, except as
otherwise provided herein, any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in
substance:   "The shares represented by this certificate were  issued
pursuant to a business combination, in a transaction  to which Rule 145
promulgated under the Securities Act of  1933, as amended, applies. The
shares represented by this  certificate may be transferred only in accordance
with the  terms of a letter agreement, dated _________, 2002, between  the
registered holder hereof and General Electric Company,  a copy of which is on
file at the principal offices of  General Electric Company. The shares have
not been acquired  by the holder with a view to, or for resale in
connection  with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the 
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The shares may not be  sold, pledged or
otherwise disposed of except pursuant to a  registration statement under, or
in accordance with an  exemption from the registration requirements of, the 
Securities Act of 1933."   The undersigned acknowledges that (i) the
undersigned has carefully read this letter and understands the requirements
hereof and the limitations imposed upon the distribution, sale,   
2    transfer or other disposition of shares of Parent Common Stock and
(ii) the receipt by Parent of this letter is an inducement to Parent\'s
obligations to consummate the Merger.   Very truly yours,    
[NAME]  Dated: ___________, ____      3      
[DATE]  [NAME]   On _________, the undersigned sold ___ shares of common
stock (the "Parent Common Stock") of Parent ("Parent") which were received by
the undersigned in connection with the merger of Osmonics, Inc. with and into
a subsidiary of Parent.   Based upon the most recent report or statement
filed by Parent with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the shares of
Parent Common Stock sold by the undersigned were within the prescribed
limitations set forth in paragraph (e) of Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").   The
undersigned hereby represents that the shares of Parent Common Stock were
sold in "brokers\' transactions" within the meaning of Section 4(4) of
the Securities Act or in transactions directly with a "market maker" as that
term is defined in Section 3(a)(38) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. The undersigned further represents that the undersigned has
not solicited or arranged for the solicitation of orders to buy the Parent
Common Stock, and that the undersigned has not made any payment in connection
with the offer or sale of the Parent Common Stock to any person other than to
the broker who executed the order in respect of such sale.   Very truly
yours,     '
