ARTICLE II

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

SECTION 2.01 _Conversion of Shares, Options and RSUs_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any equityholder of the Company:

 

(a) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_.
Each share of Company Common Stock (each a " _Share_ " and collectively, the
" _Shares_ ") held in the treasury of the Company or owned by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (each a " _Company
Subsidiary_ ") and each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall automatically be canceled without any conversion thereof and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

 

(b) _Shares of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, no par value
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par value per share, of the
Surviving Company.

(c) _Company Common Stock_. Except as provided in _Sections 2.01(a)_
and _(b)_ , each Share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive $53.00 in cash, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The Merger Consideration is payable
in accordance with _Section 2.02(b)_.

 

(d) _Company Options_. Each Company Option (other than a Rollover
Option) that has an exercise price that is less than the Merger Consideration
and that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the
Effective Time and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the holder of such Company Option or any other Person, be cancelled
and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal
to the product of (A) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Company
Option multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the applicable per share exercise price under such Company Option.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Company
Option that has an exercise price that equals or exceeds the Merger
Consideration shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist without receiving
any payment therefor.

 



-3- ##### Table of Contents

  

(e) _Rollover Options_. Each Rollover Option shall be assumed by
Parent and shall be converted into and become an option to acquire Parent
Common Stock, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, as follows:

(i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each
Rollover Option assumed by Parent shall be determined by multiplying the
number of Shares that were subject to such Rollover Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting
number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and

 

(ii) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of each Rollover Option assumed by Parent shall be determined
by dividing the applicable per share exercise price of such Rollover Option,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Exchange Ratio,
and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent.

(iii) Any restriction on the exercise of any Rollover Option assumed
and converted by Parent shall continue in full force and effect and the term,
exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Rollover Option
shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption of such
Rollover Option, in each case except to the extent otherwise provided in any
Company Equity Plan, or any stock option, employment, change of control or
other agreement between the holder of a Rollover Option and the Company.

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Company Option held by a non-
employee director of the Company that is outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall not be assumed by
Parent and shall instead be cancelled in exchange for a payment by Parent of
an amount in cash equal to the product of (a) the aggregate number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option multiplied by (b) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable per share
exercise price under such Company Option.

(f) _Company RSUs_. Each Company RSU (other than a Rollover RSU)
that is unexpired, unsettled and outstanding as of the Effective Time shall
be, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of such Company
RSU or any other Person, cancelled and automatically converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in cash for each Share subject to such
Company RSU.

 

(g) _Rollover RSUs_. Each Rollover RSU that is unexpired, unsettled
and outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent and shall
be converted into a restricted stock unit to receive, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the Rollover RSU immediately prior to
the Effective Time, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Rollover
RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares
of Parent Common Stock. Any restriction on the settlement of any Rollover RSU
assumed by Parent shall continue in full force and effect and the term,
settlement terms, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Rollover RSU
shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption and conversion
of such Rollover RSU, in each case except to the extent otherwise provided in
any Company Equity Plan, or any restricted stock unit, employment, change of
control or other agreement between the holder of a Rollover RSU and the
Company.

 



-4- ##### Table of Contents

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Company RSU held by a non-employee director
of the Company that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, shall not be assumed by Parent and shall
instead be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash for each Share subject to such Company RSU.

(h) _Company Performance RSUs_. Each Company Performance RSU that is
unexpired, unsettled and outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be, by
virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of such Company
Performance RSU or any other Person, cancelled and automatically converted
into the right to receive the product of (i) the Merger Consideration
multiplied by (ii) a number Shares equal to the Target Number of Units as set
forth in each Notice of Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award and
Award Agreement pursuant to which such Company Performance RSUs were granted.

 

(i) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the
Company, the Company Board and the Compensation and Organizational Development
Committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of
_Sections 2.01(c)_ - _(h)_. The Company shall take all actions necessary to
ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving
Company will be required to deliver Shares or other capital stock of the
Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of any Company Options,
Company RSUs or Company Performance RSUs. All payments made to holders of
Company Options, Company RSUs and Company Performance RSUs pursuant to
_Sections 2.01(d)_ , _(f)_ and  _(h)_ shall be effected within 14 calendar
days of the Closing. Within five Business Days following the Effective Time,
Parent shall deliver to any holder of a Company Option and/or Company RSU that
has been assumed by Parent an appropriate notice setting forth such former
participants rights with respect to the Company Options and Company RSUs
assumed and converted by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.01(e)_ or _Section
2.01(g)_.

 

SECTION 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i)
appoint a nationally recognized financial institution approved (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) in advance by the
Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and (ii) enter into a paying
agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company,
with such Paying Agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Article II_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or
cause the Surviving Company to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration required to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by
the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments
shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or
any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or
P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$5 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that
are then publicly available), or a combination of the foregoing. Any net
profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments
shall be payable to the Surviving Company.

 



-5- ##### Table of Contents

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be mailed to each Person who
was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ : (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Shares shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Shares to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates evidencing such Shares
(each, a " _Certificate_ " and, together, the " _Certificates_ ") or the
transfer of non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ ") in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of
Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent for cancellation, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto (and such other documents as may customarily be
required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ , and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered are registered
if the Certificate representing such Shares shall be presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required solely
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.02_ , each Certificate
shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration to which the
holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_. No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Any holder of
Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this 
_Article II_. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one or more Book-
Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to
receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event more than
three Business Days thereafter), the Merger Consideration for each Book-Entry
Share.

 

(c) _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, holders
of Shares shall cease to have any rights as Company Shareholders, except as
provided herein or by Law.

 

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares 12 months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company, upon demand, and
any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_
shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Company for, and Parent
and the Surviving Company shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for
the Merger Consideration (unless surrendered to a public official pursuant to
any escheat or similar Law). Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date that is immediately prior to such
time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Company and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to

 



-6- ##### Table of Contents

  

 this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company Options, Company RSUs or
Company Performance RSUs such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to such payment under all applicable federal, state or local Tax
laws and pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority. To the extent that amounts are so properly withheld by the Paying
Agent, the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be, and paid over to
the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Shares, Company Options, Company RSUs or Company Performance RSUs in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be.

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon (i) the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and (ii) if required by the Surviving Company, an
indemnity bond in form and substance and with surety reasonably satisfactory
to the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the
termination of the Payment Fund and subject to _Section 2.02(d)_ , Parent)
shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.01(c)_.

 

SECTION 2.03 _Share Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, (a) all
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist in exchange for the
consideration issued pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ , and all holders
of Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights as Company Shareholders except as provided for in
_Section 2.01(c)_ and (b) the share transfer books of the Company shall be
closed with respect to all Shares and there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or after
the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the
Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Company for any reason shall be
canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_.

 

SECTION 2.04 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding
Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination,
consolidation or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred,
then the Merger Consideration and the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide the holders of Shares, Rollover Options and Rollover RSUs
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event; _provided_ that this sentence shall not be construed to permit
the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by this Agreement.

 SECTION 2.05 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Shares issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder
or record who did not vote in favor of the Company Shareholder Approval (or
consent thereto in writing) and is entitled to demand, and has properly
demanded, that the Company purchase such Shares (such Shares, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") for fair market value in accordance with, and in
compliance in all respects with, Chapter 13 of the CCC shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
_Section_

 



-7- ##### Table of Contents

  

  _2.01(c)_ , but instead at the Effective Time shall be converted into the
right to receive payment of the fair market value of such Shares as may be
determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to
Chapter 13 of the CCC. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise
waives, withdraws or loses the right to payment of the fair market value of
such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CCC, or becomes
ineligible for such payment, then the right of such holder to receive such
payment in respect of such Dissenting Shares will cease and such Dissenting
Shares will be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into
and will be exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest or duplication.

 

(b) The Company will give Parent prompt notice of any demands received
by the Company for the purchase of Shares pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CCC,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the CCC and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid
the fair market value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time (unless required by Law), the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or
compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any portion
of the aggregate Merger Consideration made available to the Payment Agent to
pay for Shares that have become Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent
upon demand.

provisions of the Company Articles or the Company Bylaws. None of the Company

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

SECTION 6.01 _Proxy Statement; Company Shareholders  Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, and in any event within twenty (20) Business Days, the Company
shall prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. Each of
the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself and
its Affiliates that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement, and
each of the Company and Parent covenants that none of the information supplied
or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation in the Proxy Statement
will, at the date it is filed with the SEC or first mailed to the Company
Shareholders or at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting or at the
time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable
to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the definitive Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Company Shareholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date on which the Company is informed that the Proxy
Statement will

 



-28- ##### Table of Contents

  

 not be reviewed, or that the SEC staff has no further comments thereon. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the
SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with a copy of all
material written correspondence between the Company or any Company
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other
hand, with regards to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall give Parent and
its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement, including all amendments and supplements thereto, prior to filing
such documents with the SEC or disseminating to the Company Shareholders and
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all responses to requests for
additional information and shall give due consideration to all reasonable
changes suggested by Parent. If, at any time prior to the Company
Shareholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any
of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by
the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the Company Shareholders.

 

(b) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than the fifth
Business Day following the date of this Agreement) conduct a "broker search"
as contemplated by and in accordance with Rule 14a-13 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company Shareholders Meeting (based on a
record date that is the shortest number of days permitted under applicable
Law (without regard to Rules 14a-13(3)(i) and (ii)) and the Companys
organizational documents). If at any time the current record date for the
Company Shareholders Meeting is not reasonably likely to satisfy the
requirements of the Companys organizational documents and applicable Law, the
Company shall, in consultation with Parent, set a new record date (which shall
be the shortest number of days permitted under the Companys organizational
documents and applicable Law) and shall continue to comply with the "broker
search" requirements of Rule 14a-13 promulgated under the Exchange Act with
respect to any such new record date. 

(c) Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_
, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date on
which the Company is informed that the Proxy Statement will not be reviewed or
that the SEC staff has no further comments thereon, take all action necessary
under all applicable Laws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Shareholders Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, (i) if
(A) on a date for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is scheduled, the
Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares
to constitute a quorum and to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, whether
or not a quorum is present or (B) prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting,
to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement that is required by applicable Law is provided to the Company
Shareholders within the minimum amount of time prior to the Company
Shareholders Meeting required by applicable Law, the Company shall, after
consultation with Parent, have the right to, and (ii) upon the written
direction of Parent, if the Company has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of Shares to constitute a quorum and to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall,
in either case, make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of
the Company Shareholders Meeting; _provided_ that the Company Shareholders
Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 30 calendar
days after the date for which the Company Shareholders Meeting was

 



-29- ##### Table of Contents

  

 originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required
by applicable Law). The Company shall, unless there has been a Change of Board
Recommendation, use its reasonable efforts to solicit from the Company
Shareholders proxies in favor of the Company Shareholder Approval, and to take
all other actions necessary or advisable to secure the Company Shareholder
Approval.

 

(d) Except in the event that the Company Board shall have made a Change
of Board Recommendation as permitted by _Section 6.03_ , (i) the Proxy
Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation and (ii) the Company
Board Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to
Parent, and no resolution by the Company Board or any committee thereof to
withdraw the Company Board Recommendation or modify the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent shall be adopted; _provided_ that
the Company shall not be prohibited from including in the Proxy Statement an
accurate statement that an Acquisition Proposal has been made and such
statement shall not be deemed a Change of Board Recommendation in and of
itself.

 

SECTION 6.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

terms of any Contract entered into prior to the date hereof or as would be

Company shall (and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the Company
Representatives to), at Parents expense: (i) provide to Parent, Merger Sub
and the Parent Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours
and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company by Parent, to the officers,
agents, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, and to the books and records thereof (including Tax
Returns, but excluding any confidential information contained in personnel

Privacy and Security Laws), and with the Companys consent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to the employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and (ii) furnish as promptly as
practicable to Parent such information concerning the business, properties,
Contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries as Parent or the Parent Representatives may

Representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ shall be kept confidential in

Merger Sub and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause the Parent
Representatives and the Company Representatives, as applicable, to comply
with, all of their respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.

any Acquisition Proposal, or any proposals or offers that would be reasonably
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or

this _Section 6.03(b)_ , (iii) otherwise knowingly facilitate the making or
submission of an Acquisition Proposal, or knowingly facilitate any inquiries,
proposals or offers that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or (iv) approve, recommend or execute or enter into any
Acquisition Agreement; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company may grant a waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or
standstill agreement, to the extent necessary to allow a confidential
Acquisition Proposal to be made to the Company or the Company Board so long as
the Company promptly notifies Parent of any such waiver, amendment
or release.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any
time following the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the

or participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person (or such
Persons representatives) that has made an Acquisition Proposal and (ii)
furnish to the Person (or such Persons representatives) that has made an
Acquisition Proposal non-public information relating to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and/or afford access to the business, properties,

Subsidiaries, in each case pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ that the Company did not receive such
Acquisition Proposal as a result of a material breach of this _Section 6.03_
and prior to engaging or participating in any such discussions or negotiations
with, or furnishing any information to, such Person, (A) the Company Board (1)
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably
be expected to lead to or result in, a Superior Proposal, and (2) determines
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its
failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) the Company provides
written notice to Parent of the determination referenced in clause (A) and
(C) the Company receives from such Person, or such Person is subject to, an
executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) (i)

Acquisition Proposal or (B) any inquiries, proposals or offers received by the
Company concerning an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) disclose to Parent the
material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or any such inquiry, offer,

 material development) of the status and details (including material

and in any event within 24 hours, following a determination by the Company
Board that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, notify Parent of
such determination.

the Company Board, as applicable, shall, and neither shall publicly propose
to: (i) withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger
Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any Acquisition Agreement or (iv) fail
to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or
exchange offer within 10 Business Days after the commencement thereof (any
such action, a " _Change of Board Recommendation_ ").

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior
to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may (x)
effect a Change of Board Recommendation, if the Company receives a written
Acquisition Proposal not received as a result of a material breach of this
_Section 6.03_ that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a
Superior Proposal and determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that its failure to take such actions would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company
Shareholders under applicable Law or (y) withhold, withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation if
an Intervening Event occurs and as a result thereof the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Shareholders under
applicable Law; _provided_ that:

 

(i) prior to effecting a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to
a Superior Proposal, (A) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it
intends to effect a Change of Board Recommendation (which notice itself shall
not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation), (B) the Company has provided
Parent a copy of all proposed definitive agreements (including all financing
documents, if applicable) with respect to such Superior Proposal, (C) if
requested to do so by Parent, for a period of four calendar days following
delivery of such notice (the " _Superior Proposal Notice Period_ "), the

with Parent and its Representatives, any bona fide proposed modifications to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (D) the Company Board (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) shall have
determined in good faith, after considering the terms of any irrevocable
written offer to modify the terms of this Agreement made by Parent prior to
the expiration of the Superior Proposal Notice Period that would, upon
acceptance by the Company thereof, be binding on Parent, that such Superior
Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make a
Change of Board Recommendation in connection therewith would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company
Shareholders under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any
change to the financial or other material terms of a proposal that was
previously the subject of a notice hereunder shall require a new notice to
Parent as provided above, but with respect to any such subsequent notices
references herein to a "four calendar day period" shall be deemed references
to a "two calendar day period"); and

(ii) prior to effecting such a Change of Board Recommendation with
respect to an Intervening Event, (A) the Company has notified Parent in

Board Recommendation), (B) if requested to do so by Parent, for a period of
four calendar days following delivery of such notice (the " _Intervening Event
Notice Period_ "), the Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good
faith, and shall have made the Company Representatives available to discuss

proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (C)

terms of any irrevocable written offer to modify the terms of this Agreement
made by Parent prior to the expiration of the Intervening Event Notice Period
that would, upon acceptance by the Company thereof, be binding on Parent, that
the failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the
Company Shareholders under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that
any changes to the circumstances applicable to the Intervening Event after the
start of the Intervening Event Notice Period shall require a new notice to
Parent as provided above, but with respect to any such subsequent notices
references herein to a "four calendar day period" shall be deemed references
to a "two calendar day period").

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or
the Company Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
or complying with Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012 of Regulation M-A or
otherwise complying with Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012 of Regulation M-A under the
Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or from making any
disclosure to the Company Shareholders if the Company Board determines (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its failure to do so would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ that,
in each case, any Change of Board Recommendation may only be made in
accordance with _Section 6.03(f)_. For the avoidance of doubt, a factually
accurate public statement that describes the Companys receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
shall not, in and of itself, be deemed a Change of Board Recommendation.

(h) Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that in the event any
Company Representative or any Company Subsidiary takes any action, on behalf
of the Company, which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a material
breach of this _Section 6.03_ , and the Company does not take
reasonable action to seek to cure such breach within three Business Days of
the date on which the Company obtains Knowledge of such breach, then the
Company shall be deemed to be in breach of this _Section 6.03_.

 

SECTION 6.04 _Appropriate Action; Consent; Filings_. 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its best
efforts to obtain any Consents of third parties with respect to any Contracts
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, as may be necessary for the
consummation of the Transactions or required by the terms of any Contract of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a result of the execution,
performance or consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ that the Company
and Parent shall determine reasonably and jointly whether to seek any Consents
from third parties under any Material Contract. In the event that such third
party Consent described in this _Section 6.04(a)_ shall not be obtained, the
Company and Parent shall determine reasonably and jointly whether to take any
further 

 



-33- ##### Table of Contents

  

 actions with respect to such Contracts; _provided_ , _further_ , that
without its consent, the Company shall not be required to pay any amount or
change its business practices in order to obtain any such Consent.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
use its reasonable best efforts (subject to compliance with applicable Law) to
promptly take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to promptly do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate
and make effective the Transactions and to use their respective reasonable
best efforts to cause the conditions to each partys obligation to consummate
the Transactions as set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied as promptly as
practicable (but in no event later than the Outside Date), including (i)
promptly obtaining all authorizations, Consents, Orders, approvals, licenses,
permits, and waivers of all Governmental Authorities and officials that may be
or become necessary for the performance of its obligations pursuant to this
Agreement, (ii) cooperating fully with the other party in promptly seeking to
obtain all such authorizations, Consents, Orders, approvals, licenses, permits
and waivers, (iii) responding as promptly as practicable and providing such
other information to any Governmental Authority as such Governmental
Authority may lawfully request in connection herewith, (iv) obtaining all
Governmental Consents required for the satisfaction of the condition set forth
in _Section 7.01(c)_ as promptly as practicable and (v) contesting
and defending any Action, whether legislative, judicial or administrative,
brought under, pursuant to or relating to any regulatory Law challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) (an " _Antitrust Order_ ") that
restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any of the
other Transactions under any Antitrust Law.

(c) In connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 6.04(b)_ and
without limiting the generality of the undertaking pursuant thereto, Parent
and the Company shall promptly make all filings that may be required for the
satisfaction of the condition set forth in _Section 7.01(c)_ by each of them
in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, which, in any event,
shall be made within 10 Business Days following the date of this Agreement
with respect to the initial filings required under the HSR Act and within 15
Business Days after the date of this Agreement with respect to the required
Governmental Approvals set forth on _Section 7.01(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. Each party shall furnish to the other party such
necessary information and assistance as the other party may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation of any necessary filings or
submissions by it to any Governmental Authority.

 

(d) If any objections are asserted with respect to the Transactions
under any Antitrust Law, or if any suit is instituted or threatened by any
Governmental Authority or any other Person challenging any of the Transactions
as violating any Antitrust Law or if a filing pursuant to _Section 6.04(b)_ is
reasonably likely to be rejected or conditioned by a Governmental Authority,
then each of the parties shall use its best efforts to resolve such objections
or challenges as such Governmental Authority or other Person may have to such
transactions so as to permit consummation of the Transactions as soon as
practicable and in any event prior to the Outside Date. Without limiting the
generality of the undertaking of Parent pursuant to _Section 6.04(b)_ , Parent
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its and their best
efforts, and promptly take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law or any other Person so as to
enable the parties hereto to consummate the Transactions as promptly as
practicable, and in any event prior to the Outside Date, including (i)
proposing, negotiating, offering to commit and effect (and if such offer
is accepted,

 



-34- ##### Table of Contents

  

 committing to and effecting), by consent decree, hold separate orders or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of such of its
and their assets, properties or businesses, or of the assets, properties or
businesses to be acquired by Parent pursuant hereto, (ii) terminating or
amending any existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations or
(iii) otherwise offering to take or offering to commit to take any actions
(and if such offer is accepted, taking or committing to take), such actions as
are necessary or advisable, whether or not such actions limit or modify
Parents rights of ownership in, or ability to conduct the business of, one or
more of its operations, divisions, businesses, product lines, customers or
assets, including, after the Closing, the business of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, in each case as if such action is necessary to satisfy
the condition set forth in  _Section 7.01(c)_ prior to the Outside Date
and/or to avoid the entry of, and the commencement of litigation seeking the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other Antitrust Order in any suit or proceeding by a
Governmental Authority or any other Person under any Antitrust Laws that would
otherwise have the effect of delaying or preventing the consummation of the
Merger and the other Transactions beyond the Outside Date. The Company shall
agree, if required by Parent, to divest, hold separate or take other actions
with respect to its business and assets in furtherance of Parents obligation
under this _Section 6.04(d)_ ; _provided_ that any such action shall
be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger, and in no event shall the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries be required or expected to pay any
amount or incur additional costs or expenses in order to obtain any such
Governmental Consent. Parent acknowledges its obligation under _Section
6.04(b)_ to contest and defend any Action challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions in no way limits the obligation of Parent to
use, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to use, its and their best efforts,
and to take any and all steps necessary to eliminate each and every impediment
under any Antitrust Law to consummate the Transactions prior to the Outside
Date.

 

(e) Each party shall keep the other parties apprised (to the extent
legally permissible) of the content and status of any communications with,
and communications from, any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Transactions, including promptly notifying the other parties hereto of any
material communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to any review or investigation of the
Transactions under the HSR Act or any other applicable non-United States
Antitrust Laws and shall permit the other parties to review in advance (and
to consider any comments made by the other party in relation to) any proposed
substantive communication by such party to any Governmental Authority relating
to such matters. The parties to this Agreement will coordinate and cooperate
fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing such
assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions, the parties agree to (i) give each
other reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any Governmental
Authority relating to any Antitrust Laws, (ii) give each other an opportunity
to participate in each of such meetings, (iii) give each other reasonable
advance notice of all substantive oral communications with any Governmental
Authority relating to any Antitrust Laws, (iv) if any Governmental Authority
initiates a substantive oral communication regarding any Antitrust Laws, to
promptly notify the other parties of the substance of such communication, (v)
provide each other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment
upon all written communications (including any analyses, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals) with a Governmental
Authority regarding any Antitrust Laws and (vi) provide each other with copies
of all written communications from any Governmental Authority relating to any
Antitrust Laws. The parties to this Agreement shall provide each other with
copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of
their representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental

 



-35- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that
materials may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation
of the Company, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and
(iii) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns. Any disclosures or provision of copies by one party
to the other may be made on an outside counsel basis, if appropriate.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to the Companys consultation and participation rights described
above, Parent shall have the principal responsibility for devising and
implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition
or investment review clearances as promptly as practicable, and in any event
prior to the Outside Date, including in connection with the determination of
any actions to be taken under _Section 6.06(b)_ , and shall take the lead in
all meetings and communications with any Governmental Authority in connection
with obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition or investment review
clearances.

 

(f) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall enter into any agreement,
transaction or any agreement to effect any transaction (including any merger
or acquisition) that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or
materially and adversely affect Parents or Merger Subs ability to: (i)
obtain the timely expiration or termination of the waiting period under the
HSR Act, or the authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals required under
any other applicable Antitrust Law, applicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) avoid the entry of, the commencement of
litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order that would materially
delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions, or (iii) obtain all
authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals of Governmental Authorities
necessary for the consummation of the Transactions in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 6.05 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that, for a period commencing upon the Effective Time
and ending on December 31, 2017 (or, if shorter, during the period of
employment), Parent shall, or it shall cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to, (i) provide each employee of the Company and of each of the
Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (each a " _Company Employee_ ")
that remains an employee of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates (each, a " _Continuing
Employee_ "), other than any Continuing Employee covered by a Collective
Bargaining Agreement, with at least the same level of base salary or base
hourly wage, if applicable, that was provided to each such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) provide each Continuing
Employee with a cash incentive compensation opportunity that is at least equal
(including with respect to individual target bonus as a percentage of base
salary) to that provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (iii) provide the Continuing Employee with employee
benefits (other than equity-based awards and defined benefit or non-qualified
arrangements) that are materially no less favorable in the aggregate than the
employee benefits (other than equity-based awards and defined benefit or non-
qualified arrangements) provided to such Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time. No later than February 5, 2017, the Company shall
pay bonuses for the Companys fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 pursuant
to the Companys annual incentive plan at the actual performance level during
the applicable performance period excluding the effect of accounting
adjustments related to the Closing and expenses incurred in connection with
the Transactions (but in no event less than 80% of target levels), including
to (x) an employee whose employment is terminated (other than due to a 

 



-36- ##### Table of Contents

  

 termination for cause or a resignation) or (y) an individual that is party
to a Change of Control Retention and Severance Agreement, who has a
"Termination Upon a Change of Control", in either case upon such termination.
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to,
honor in accordance with their terms all applicable Collective Bargaining
Agreements as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, it being
understood that the foregoing shall not limit the right of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company, to amend or terminate any
Collective Bargaining Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their
terms, all employment, change in control, retention and severance agreements
and other Company Benefit Plans listed on _Section 6.05(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time that
are applicable to any current or former employees or directors of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, and all obligations thereunder, including any
rights or benefits arising as a result of the Transactions (either alone or
in combination with any other event, including termination of employment). The
Company and Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall cooperate in good faith to
mitigate and/or minimize the impact of the tax consequences of Section 280G
of the Code (including as a result of the Transactions under all employment,
change of control, severance and termination agreements, equity awards, other
compensation arrangements and Company Benefit Plans);  _provided_ , that such
cooperation shall not be deemed to require Parent to provide any "gross ups"
or to incur any material cost or liability.

 

(c) Company Employees shall receive credit for their service on or
prior to the Effective Time with the Company, any Company Subsidiary and all
of the Companys Affiliates for all purposes (including, for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to
receive benefits, but excluding benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan or post-retirement medical arrangement) under any "employee
benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, established or maintained
by Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
under which each Company Employee may be eligible to participate on or after
the Effective Time (collectively, " _New Plans_ ") to the same extent
recognized by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under comparable
Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time and as would not
result in duplication of benefits. Such plan, program or arrangement shall
credit each such Company Employee for service accrued or deemed accrued on or
prior to the Effective Time with the Company, any Company Subsidiary and all
of the Companys Affiliates where service with the Affiliate was credited
under a comparable Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) To the extent any Company Employee participates in a New Plan that
is a welfare plan or arrangement of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
following the Closing Date (a " _Parent Welfare Plan_ "), Parent and any of
its Subsidiaries will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and any
insurer or service provider under the applicable Parent Welfare Plan, cause
all (i) pre-existing condition limitations which otherwise would be applicable
to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents under a group
health plan to be waived to the extent satisfied under a Company Benefit Plan
comparable to such Parent Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date
or, if later, immediately prior to such Company Employees commencement of
participation in such Parent Welfare Plan, (ii) participation waiting periods
under each Parent Welfare Plan that would otherwise be applicable to such
Company Employee to be waived to the same extent waived or satisfied under the
Company Benefit Plan comparable to such Parent Welfare Plan immediately prior
to the Effective Time or, if later, immediately prior to such Company
Employees commencement of participation in

 



-37- ##### Table of Contents

  

 such Parent Welfare Plan and (iii) co-payments and deductibles paid by
Company Employees in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs to be
credited for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out of
pocket requirement under any such Parent Welfare Plan that is a group health
plan.

 

(e) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that
consummation of the Transactions will constitute a change of control of the
Company under the terms of the Companys employee plans, programs,
arrangements and contracts containing provisions triggering payment, vesting
or other rights upon a change of control or similar transaction.

(f) The Company shall take any and all actions with respect to the
ESPP as are necessary to provide that (i) participation in the ESPP shall be
limited to those employees who were participants on the date hereof, (ii) such
participants may not increase their payroll deduction election or purchase
elections from those in effect on the date hereof, (iii) the ESPP shall
terminate, effective as of the earlier of (A) the end of the current Purchase
Period (as defined in the ESPP) or (B) two Business Days before the Effective
Time (the " _ESPP Termination Date_ "), and (iv) each purchase right under
the ESPP outstanding as of the ESPP Termination Date shall be automatically
exercised by applying the payroll deductions of each participant in the ESPP
for such Purchase Period to the purchase of a number of whole Common Shares
(subject to the provisions of the ESPP regarding the number of shares
purchasable) at a purchase price per share equal to 85% of the Fair Market
Value (as defined in the ESPP) of a Common Share on the Offering Date (as
defined in the ESPP) or on the ESPP Termination Date, whichever is lower.

 

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as
Parent may reasonably request so as to enable the Surviving Company to effect
such actions relating to the 401(k) plan of the Company (the " _401(k) Plan_
") and any Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code
as Parent may deem necessary or appropriate, including amending and/or
terminating the 401(k) Plan or any such other plan prior to the Effective
Time, subject to the terms of the 401(k) Plan or any such other plan and
applicable Law and provided that such action does not preclude the immediate
participation of the Company Employees in any successor 401(k) plan or other
replacement plan.

 

(h) This _Section 6.05_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
_Section 6.05_ , express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other
Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this _Section 6.05_. Nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as an
amendment of any particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third party
any right to enforce the provisions of this _Section 6.05,_ (iii) require
Parent or any of its Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular Company
Benefit Plan or (B) retain the employment of any particular Company Employee

Surviving Company, to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan in
accordance with its terms; it being understood that no amendment or
termination of any employment, change in control, retention or severance
agreements or other Company Benefit Plan that requires the consent of the
employee to amend or terminate such agreement or Company Benefit Plan may be
effected without such consent.

 

(i) Parent shall (i) file with the SEC, promptly after the date on
which the Merger becomes effective, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
any successor form), Form S-3 (or any successor form) or another appropriate
form, relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to
the Company Options and Company RSUs assumed by Parent in accordance with

  _Section 2.01(e)_ and _Section 2.01(g)_ , (ii) use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and
maintain the current status of the prospectuses contained therein for so long
as such assumed Company Options and Company RSUs remain outstanding and (iii)
deliver to each holder of an assumed Company Option or Company RSU an
appropriate notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant to such award.

(j) Following the date hereof, each of Parent and the Company (and
their respective Affiliates) will use reasonable best efforts in all matters
necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section 6.05_ and
the requirements of any applicable Law and will provide, and will cause each
of their respective representatives, including legal, human resources and
regulatory compliance personnel, to provide, all cooperation reasonably
requested by the other party in that regard, including, cooperating and

notification and other required processes under applicable Law to take place
and (ii) relating to workers compensation, employee benefits and employee
benefit plan coverages (in each case, except to the extent prohibited by
applicable Law or to the extent that such information and data relates to
performance ratings or assessments of employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries), making any and all required filings and notices, making any and
all required communications with Company Employees and obtaining any permits
or authorizations from any Governmental Authority required hereunder. Such
cooperation will include the provision of any information and consultation
required by applicable Law, the terms of any Contract, or as reasonably
requested by the other party. Each of Parent and the Company will make
available its representatives at such times and in such places as the other
party may reasonably request for purposes of discussions with representatives
of any such works council, economic committee, union or similar body.

 SECTION 6.06 _Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Parent hereby
guarantees the due, prompt and faithful payment, performance and discharge by
Merger Sub of, and the compliance by Merger Sub with, all of the covenants,

announcing the execution of this Agreement. Thereafter, each of Parent and the
Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or

of the Transactions, except to the extent public disclosure is required by
applicable Law or the requirements of the NYSE or NASDAQ, in which case the

SECTION 6.09 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Company shall, jointly and severally, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless each of the
Companys and the Company Subsidiaries respective present or former
directors, officers and employees (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ", and
collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with
any Action (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or relating
to any action or omission in their capacity as an officer, director,
employee, fiduciary or agent, whether occurring on or before the Effective
Time. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, Parent and the Surviving Company
shall, jointly and severally, pay all expenses (including reasonable legal
fees and expenses) of each Indemnified Party in advance of the final
disposition of any such Action, subject to receipt from the Indemnified Party
to whom such expenses are advanced of an undertaking, to the extent required
by the CCC, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined in
accordance with applicable Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification. In the event of any such Action, (i) Parent or the Surviving
Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the
Indemnified Parties promptly after statements therefor are received, (ii)
neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened Action to which an
Indemnified Party is a party (and in respect of which indemnification could be
sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such Action or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Company shall cooperate
in the defense of any such matter; _provided_ that neither Parent nor the
Surviving Company shall be liable for any settlement effected without the
Surviving Companys written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event
that any claim for indemnification is asserted or made within such six-year
period, all rights to indemnification in respect of such claim shall continue
until the disposition of such claim. The rights of each Indemnified Party

have under the certificate of incorporation or

 



-40- ##### Table of Contents

  

 bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of the Company and the
Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries, or under any Law or under any
indemnification agreement of any Indemnified Party with the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, to the
fullest extent permitted under the CCC, honor and fulfill in all respects the
obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under any and all
indemnification agreements between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and
any Indemnified Party in existence on the date of this Agreement (the " _D andO
Indemnification Agreements_"). In addition, the articles of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Company shall contain provisions no less favorable
with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses of
directors, officers and employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
than are set forth in the Company Articles or the Company Bylaws, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the
Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall bind and purchase directors
and officers runoff insurance coverage (the " _D andO Runoff Insurance_"),
which by its terms shall survive the Merger for not less than six years for
the benefit of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Companys and
any Company Subsidiaries past and present directors and/or officers that are
insured under the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The DandO
Runoff Insurance shall provide coverage for the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and such persons in their capacity as directors, officers and/or
employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time that is not less favorable in the aggregate than the Companys
existing directors and officers policy or, if substantially equivalent
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage. The Surviving
Company shall maintain the DandO Runoff Insurance in full force and effect and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder for a period of six years after
the Effective Time or, if such policies are terminated or cancelled, obtain
(subject to the limitations set forth in the next sentence) alternative DandO
Runoff Insurance on substantially similar terms as set forth in this _Section
6.09(c)_. Neither the Company nor the Surviving Company shall be required to
pay an annual premium for the DandO Runoff Insurance in excess of 300% of the
last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum
Amount_ ") (it being understood and agreed that in the event the cost of such

capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth in _Annex A_ attached
hereto.

 SECTION 9.04 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement
that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall

SECTION 9.06 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the

 purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the
preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

SECTION 9.07 _Parties in Interest_. Other than the provisions of
_Article II_ (which, from and after the Effective Time, shall be for the
benefit of the holders of Shares, Company Options, Company RSUs and Company
Performance RSUs as of the Effective Time to the extent necessary for such
holders to receive the consideration due such holders thereunder) and _Section
6.09_ (which is for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby and may
be enforced by such Persons), this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this

where Parent or the Company is obligated to consummate the Merger and the
Merger has not been consummated, each of Parent and the Company expressly
acknowledges and agrees that the other party and its shareholders shall have

compensate such other party and its shareholders and that such other party on
behalf of itself and its shareholders shall be entitled to enforce
specifically Parents or the Companys, as the case may be, obligation to
consummate the Merger. Each party further agrees that no other party or any
other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section 9.08_ , and each party irrevocably waives any
right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
bond or similar instrument. In the event that a party initiates a proceeding
seeking equitable relief pursuant to this _Section 9.08_ , the Outside Date
shall automatically be extended until such proceeding is finally resolved.

Material Adverse Effect and (y) shall not be construed as an admission by the
Company of any non-compliance with, or violation of, any third party rights
(including any intellectual property rights) or any Law or Order of any
Governmental Authority, such disclosures having been made solely for the
purposes of creating exceptions to the representations made herein or of
disclosing any information required to be disclosed under this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, no reference to or disclosure of a possible
breach or violation of any Contract or agreement, Law or Order shall be

has actually occurred.

different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement. Any such counterpart, to the extent
delivered using Electronic Delivery shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original executed counterpart and shall be considered to have
the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. No party hereto shall raise the use of Electronic
Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic
Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such party
forever waives any such defense, except to the extent that such defense
relates to lack of authenticity.
