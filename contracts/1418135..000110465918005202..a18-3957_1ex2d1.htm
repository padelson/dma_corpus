 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 ** _EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK_**

 



 

Section 3.01 _Effect on Capital Stock of Maple Parent_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of DPSG, Maple
Parent or Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) Each share of Class A common stock, $0.01 par value, of Maple Parent ( the
" _Maple Parent Class A Shares_") and each share of Class B common stock,
$0.01 par value, of Maple Parent (the " _Maple Parent Class B Shares_" and
collectively with the Maple Parent Class A Shares, the " _Maple Parent Shares_
") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive a number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of DPSG Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (collectively, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section
3.01(c)_, and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Laws
in accordance with _Section 3.04_, upon delivery of duly executed letters of
transmittal in accordance with _Section 3.02_, and each record holder of such
Maple Parent Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter
cease to have any rights with respect thereto except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, in consideration therefor pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. The Merger Consideration issued (and paid) in accordance with the
terms of this _Article III_ upon conversion of any Maple Parent Shares and
delivery of duly executed letters of transmittal in accordance with _Section
3.02_ will be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such Maple Parent Shares, and after the Effective
Time there will be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of Maple Parent Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any duly executed letters of transmittal with respect to former Maple
Parent Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Transfer Agent
for any reason, they will be treated in accordance with this _Article III_. "
_Exchange Ratio_ " means a number equal to the product of (i) 6.6923 and (ii)
the quotient obtained by dividing the number of Fully Diluted DPSG Shares by
the number of Fully Diluted Maple Parent Shares (each as set forth in the
applicable certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 3.01(e)_).

 



 

(c) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time (and as permitted by _Article VI_), the number of Fully
Diluted DPSG Shares or the number of Fully Diluted Maple Parent Shares shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of
shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split,
combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred,
then the Merger Consideration and the Special Dividend Per Share Amount shall
be appropriately and proportionately adjusted to provide to the holders of the
shares of DPSG Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , _however_ , that no adjustment

 



      
 

 



 

under this _Section 3.01(c)_ shall be made with respect to any change in the
number of Fully Diluted DPSG Shares resulting from issuances permitted by
_Section 6.02_.

 



 

(d) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Maple Parent or the holders of
the Maple Parent Shares, each Maple Parent Share held in the treasury of Maple
Parent shall automatically be cancelled without any conversion thereof and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

 



 

(e) _Fully Diluted DPSG Shares; Fully Diluted Maple Parent Shares_. Prior to
the Closing, (i) DPSG shall deliver to Maple Parent a certificate signed on
behalf of DPSG by the Chief Financial Officer of DPSG setting forth the total
number of Fully Diluted DPSG Shares as of the close of business on the
Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date (after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated in _Section 7.05_), and (ii) Maple Parent shall
deliver to DPSG a certificate signed on behalf of Maple Parent by the Chief
Financial Officer of Maple Parent setting forth the total number of Fully
Diluted Maple Parent Shares as of the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Closing Date (after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated in _Section 7.06_ and the Maple Parent
Restructuring). Absent manifest error or fraud, each certificate delivered
pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be final and binding on the parties
and all holders of Equity Interests in any of the parties.

 



 

Section 3.02 _Exchange of Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Transfer Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, DPSG shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("
_Transfer Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders of the Maple Parent
Shares, a number of shares of DPSG Common Stock, in book-entry or certificated
form, equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration issuable pursuant to
_Section 3.01(b)_ for the purpose of exchanging Maple Parent Shares for the
Merger Consideration.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Prior to the Effective Time, Maple Parent will
provide to each Person who is or will be, as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a holder of record of Maple Parent Shares (for the avoidance
of doubt, after giving effect to the Maple Parent Restructuring contemplated
by _Section 7.15_), a letter of transmittal (which shall contain customary
representations and warranties of the type commensurate with a private
placement of securities exempt from registration under the Securities Act and
such other provisions as DPSG may reasonably specify (including a provision
confirming that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of such letter of transmittal). Upon delivery
to the Transfer Agent of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Transfer Agent or DPSG,
the holder of such Maple Parent Shares will be entitled to receive (following
the Effective Time) in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration (together
with cash in lieu of fractional shares) that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_, and the respective
Maple Parent Shares will forthwith be canceled. Until exchanged as
contemplated by this _Section 3.02_, any Maple Parent Shares will be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such exchange Merger Consideration as contemplated

 



      
 

 



 

by this _Section 3.02_. No interest will be paid or accrue on any cash
payable upon exchange of any Maple Parent Shares.

 



 

Section 3.03 _No Fractional Shares_.

 



 

(a) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of DPSG Common
Stock will be issued upon the conversion of Maple Parent Shares pursuant to
_Section 3.02_, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of DPSG Common Stock. For
purposes of this _Section 3.03_, all fractional shares to which a single
record holder would be entitled will be aggregated, and calculations will be
rounded up to three decimal places.

 



 

(b) Fractional shares of DPSG Common Stock that would otherwise be allocable
to any former holders of Maple Parent Shares in the Merger will be aggregated,
and no holder of Maple Parent Shares will receive cash in exchange therefor
equal to or greater than the value of one full share of DPSG Common Stock. The
Transfer Agent will cause the whole shares obtained thereby to be sold, in the
open market or otherwise as reasonably directed by DPSG, and in no case later
than 20 Business Days after the Effective Time (assuming all Maple Parent
Shares have been surrendered pursuant to _Section 3.02_ by such date). The
Transfer Agent will make available the net proceeds thereof, after deducting
any required withholding Taxes and brokerage charges, commissions and transfer
Taxes, on a pro rata basis, without interest, as soon as practicable to the
holders of Maple Parent Shares entitled to receive such cash. Payment of cash
in lieu of fractional shares of DPSG Common Stock will be made solely for the
purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to DPSG of issuing
fractional shares of DPSG Common Stock and will not represent separately
bargained-for consideration.

 



 

Section 3.04 _Withholding Rights_. DPSG, the Surviving Corporation, and the
Transfer Agent, as the case may be, will deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise required to be distributed pursuant to this Agreement
(including the Special Dividend) such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. Any withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been distributed to the Persons otherwise entitled hereto.

 



 

Section 3.05 _No Liability_. None of the parties hereto, the Surviving
Corporation or the Transfer Agent will be liable to any Person in respect of
any shares of DPSG Common Stock properly delivered to any public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Law.

 



 

Section 3.06 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by DPSG or Maple Parent to be necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title, and possession, and to all rights and
property, of Merger Sub and Maple Parent, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and DPSG shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Merger Sub, in the name of Maple Parent, and otherwise) to take such action.

each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification or
licensing, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified, licensed or
in such good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably be expected to have a Maple
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) True and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws
of Maple Parent, each as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have
previously been made available to DPSG.

of securities, and are not subject to or issued in violation of any purchase
option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription
right or any similar right under any provision of the DGCL, the Maple
certificate of incorporation, the Maple by-laws or any Contract to which Maple

(e) Except as set forth in _Section 4.02(b)_ of the Maple Parent Disclosure
Letter, all of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of each Maple
Parent Subsidiary are owned by Maple Parent, directly or indirectly, free and
clear of any Liens, other than Liens for Taxes that are not yet due and
immaterial Liens or Permitted Liens, and free of any restriction on the right
to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such Equity Interests (other than
restrictions under applicable securities Laws), and all of such Equity
Interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Except for the Equity Interests
of the Maple Parent Subsidiaries, as of the date of this Agreement, Maple
Parent does not beneficially own directly or indirectly any capital stock,
membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest or other
Equity Interest in any Person.

Agreement, every holder of record of Maple Parent Shares duly executed and

currently in effect and has not been rescinded. The Maple Parent Stockholder
Consent will be effective immediately following the execution of this
Agreement. Maple Parent has all necessary corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, and, upon the effectiveness of the Maple
Parent Stockholder Consent, to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions, and to perform its other obligations hereunder. The execution,
delivery and, upon the effectiveness of the Maple Parent Stockholder Consent,
performance of this Agreement by Maple Parent and the consummation by Maple
Parent of the Merger and the other Transactions, has been duly and validly

approvals, and, upon the effectiveness of the Maple Parent Stockholder
Consent, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Maple Parent are
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Maple Parent and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties
hereto) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Maple Parent,

performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
respective properties or assets of Maple Parent or any Maple Parent Subsidiary
under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any contract, note, bond,

Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their respective

aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Maple Parent Material Adverse
Effect and (2) in the case of clause (ii)(B), for any such violations,

precedent to Maple Parents obligations to effect the Closing hereunder, no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would

or funding of the

be expected to have a DPSG Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.02 _Capitalization_. (a) (i) As of the date of this Agreement, the
authorized DPSG capital stock consists of (A) 800,000,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _DPSG Common Stock_ ") and (B)

DPSG or any of its Subsidiaries to issue shares of DPSG Common Stock or other
Equity Interests of DPSG or any DPSG Subsidiary to any Person (other than
Maple Parents shareholders) and will not result in a right of any holder of
DPSGs Equity Interests to adjust the exercise, conversion, exchange or reset
price under any of such securities.

 



 

(iii) Assuming the accuracy of Maple Parents representations and warranties
in _Section 4.17_, the shares of DPSG Common Stock constituting Merger

than restrictions on transfer under applicable securities Laws) and issued in
compliance with all applicable Laws governing the issuance of securities and
will not be subject to or issued in violation of any purchase option, call
option, right of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any

to any voting trust, proxy, voting agreement, stockholder agreements or other
similar agreement with respect to the voting, transfer or dividend rights of
any Equity Interests in DPSG. There are no outstanding agreements or other
obligations of DPSG or any of its Subsidiaries requiring the registration for
sale of any shares of DPSG Common Stock or other Equity Interests of DPSG or
any of its Subsidiaries convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or
evidencing the right to subscribe for or purchase shares of DPSG Common Stock
and no such additional agreements is currently contemplated.

rights.

delivered to Merger Sub the Merger Sub Stockholder Consent pursuant to Section
228 of the DGCL. DPSG has delivered to Maple Parent a copy of the Merger Sub
Stockholder Consent, which Merger Sub Stockholder Consent is currently in
effect and has not been rescinded. The Merger Sub Stockholder Consent will be

Agreement by Merger Sub and the consummation by Merger Sub of the Merger and
the other Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action, and, upon the effectiveness of the Merger Sub Stockholder
Consent, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Merger Sub are
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions. The board of
directors of DPSG (the " _DPSG Board_ ") has determined that this Agreement
and the Merger and the other Transactions are in the best interests of DPSG
and its stockholders, has adopted this Agreement and recommended that its
stockholders vote in favor of approving the DPSG Charter Amendment and the
DPSG Stock Issuance and has directed that the DPSG Charter Amendment and the
DPSG Stock Issuance be submitted to DPSGs stockholders for approval at a duly
held meeting of such stockholders for such purpose (the " _DPSG Stockholders
Meeting_ "). Assuming the accuracy of Maple Parents representations and
warranties in _Section 4.17_, except for (i) the approval of the DPSG Charter
Amendment by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of
DPSG Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon and (ii) the

Common Stock present and which have actually voted at the DPSG Stockholders
Meeting ((i) and (ii), collectively, the " _DPSG Stockholders Approval_ "), no
other corporate proceedings on the part of DPSG or any other vote by the
holders of any class or series of DPSG Capital Stock are necessary to approve
or adopt this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions
(except for the filing of the appropriate merger documents and the DPSG
Charter Amendment as required by the DGCL and except for DPSG Board action to
declare the Special Dividend). This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by DPSG and Merger Sub and (assuming due

 



      
 

 



 

authorization, execution and delivery by Maple Parent and the accuracy of
Maple Parents representations and warranties in _Section 4.17_) constitutes
the valid and binding obligation of DPSG and Merger Sub, enforceable against
DPSG and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms (except as may be limited by
the Enforceability Limitations).

 



 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by DPSG or Merger Sub
nor the consummation by DPSG or Merger Sub of the Merger or the other
Transactions, nor compliance by DPSG or Merger Sub with any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement, will (i) constitute a breach or violation of, or
a default under, the DPSG Charter or the DPSG By-laws or (ii) assuming that
the consents, approvals and filings referred to in _Section 5.04_ are duly
obtained and/or made, (A) assuming the accuracy of Maple Parents
representations and warranties in _Section 4.17_, violate any Injunction or
any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or
decree applicable to DPSG or any DPSG Subsidiary or any of its respective
properties or assets or (B) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of any
provision of or the loss of any benefit under, constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or
cancelation under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of DPSG
or any DPSG Subsidiary under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
any contract, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease,
agreement or other instrument or obligation to which DPSG or any of the DPSG
Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound or affected, except, (1) in the case of
_clause (ii)(A)_ , for such violations that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a DPSG Material Adverse Effect and
(2) in the case of _clause (ii)(B)_ , for any such violations, conflicts,
breaches, defaults, terminations, rights of termination or cancelations,
accelerations or Liens that would not individually and not in the aggregate
with any such other violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations,
rights of termination or cancelations, accelerations or Liens, reasonably be
expected to have a DPSG Material Adverse Effect.

the Regulatory Agencies, and have paid all fees and assessments due and
payable in connection therewith, except in each case where the failure to file

ERISA, Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA or (2) a "multiple

been adopted and no proceeding has been commenced by the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation to terminate any such plan.

material compliance with its terms and with all applicable Law. No non-exempt
"prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA and

a DPSG Material Adverse Effect.

nothing has occurred or is reasonably expected to cause the loss of such
qualification.

 



 

(g) Except as would not reasonably be likely to result in material liability
to DPSG and the DPSG Subsidiaries taken as a whole, neither the execution or
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions will

(A) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to
be provided, to any director, employee or independent contractor of DPSG or
any of the DPSG Subsidiaries, (B) increase the amount or value of any benefit
or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such
director, employee or independent contractor, (C) result in the acceleration
of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit or compensation
or (D) result in the payment of any amount that could, individually or in
combination with any other payment or benefit, constitute an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) No Person is entitled to receive any additional payment (including any tax
gross-up payment) from DPSG or any of the DPSG Subsidiaries as a result of the
imposition of additional taxes under Section 4999 or Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(i) Except as would not reasonably be likely to result in material liability
to DPSG and the DPSG Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (i) each DPSG Benefit Plan

obligation of DPSG or the DPSG Subsidiaries exists with respect to any DPSG
Foreign Benefit Plan that has not been accrued in accordance with applicable

Subsidiaries (or in the case of DPSG Subsidiaries acquired by DPSG after such
date, since the date of such acquisition) have withheld all material amounts
required by applicable Law to be withheld from the wages, salaries, and other

ordinary course of business consistent with past practice).

 



 

(m) Except as would not, reasonably be expected to have a DPSG Material
Adverse Effect, DPSGs execution and delivery of this Agreement and DPSGs
performance of this Agreement does not require DPSG to seek or obtain consent,

(a) DPSG has designed and maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of DPSGs financial reporting and the preparation of DPSGs

records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of DPSG; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP and that receipts and
expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and the DPSG Board; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the assets of DPSG that could have a material effect on its
financial statements. DPSGs management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of DPSGs system of internal control over financial reporting in

the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, and that assessment concluded that
those controls were effective.

that all information required to be disclosed by DPSG in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and is
accumulated and communicated to DPSGs management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable the principal
executive officer of DPSG and the principal financial officer of DPSG to make
the certifications required under the

 



      
 

 



 

Exchange Act with respect to such reports and (ii) has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, to DPSG
auditors and the DPSG Board and audit committee of the DPSG Board (A) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect DPSGs ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in DPSGs internal control over financial reporting. Since December 31,
2016, none of DPSG, DPSGs auditors, DPSGs Board or the audit committee of

officer of DPSG, as applicable) have made all certifications required by Rule
13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the
SEC and the NYSE, and the statements contained in any such certifications are
complete and correct in all material respects.

be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities
Act that has not been disclosed in the DPSG SEC Reports publicly filed or
furnished with the SEC following December 31, 2015.

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among DPSG or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance-sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose

Material Adverse Effect:

 



 

(a) DPSG and the DPSG Subsidiaries are, and have been, in compliance, with all
Environmental Laws applicable to their respective operations, which compliance
includes the possession and maintenance of, and compliance with, all Permits
required under applicable Environmental Laws for the operation of the business
of DPSG and the DPSG Subsidiaries. Neither DPSG nor any of the DPSG
Subsidiaries has received any written notice, demand, letter or claim alleging
that DPSG or any DPSG Subsidiary is in violation of or liable under any
Environmental Law, including with respect to any alleged release of or
exposure to any Hazardous Substances or the validity of or failure to comply

DPSG, no such notice, demand or claim has been threatened.

 



 

(b) Neither DPSG nor any of the DPSG Subsidiaries is a party to or is the
subject of any pending or, to the Knowledge of DPSG, threatened Legal
Proceeding (i) alleging any Liability or responsibility under or noncompliance
with any Environmental Law or (ii) seeking to impose any financial
responsibility for any investigation, cleanup, removal, containment or any
other remediation of or exposure to, Hazardous Substances, and, to DPSGs
Knowledge, no Hazardous Substances are present at, on or under any DPSG Owned
Real Property or DPSG Leased Real Property of a type or in a condition that
would reasonably be expected to give rise to liability under Environmental
Laws on the part of DPSG or any DPSG Subsidiaries. Neither DPSG nor any DPSG
Subsidiary is subject to any Order or agreement by or with any Governmental
Entity or third party imposing any material liability or obligation on DPSG or
any DPSG Subsidiary with respect to any of the foregoing.

 



 

Section 5.16 _Real Property_. Except as would not have a DPSG Material Adverse
Effect, DPSG or a DPSG Subsidiary has good fee simple title to all real
property owned by DPSG or any DPSG Subsidiaries (the " _DPSG Owned Real
Property_ ") in each case free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted
Liens. DPSG or a DPSG Subsidiary has a valid leasehold estate in all real
property leased, subleased, licensed or otherwise occupied by DPSG or any DPSG
Subsidiaries (the " _DPSG Leased Real Property_ "), free and clear of all
Liens except for Permitted Liens, except for any such invalidity that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a DPSG Material Adverse
Effect. All buildings, structures, fixtures and other improvements on the DPSG
Owned Real Property and the DPSG Leased Real Property are in good condition
and are adequate to operate the business as currently conducted, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
DPSG Material Adverse Effect. Neither DPSG nor any DPSG Subsidiary owns,
holds, has granted or is obligated under any option, right of first offer,
right of first refusal or other contractual right to sell or dispose of any of
the DPSG Owned Real Property or any portion thereof or interest therein that
is individually or in the aggregate material to DPSG and the DPSG Subsidiaries
taken as a whole.

Subsidiaries for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, or in any other document
filed with any other Regulatory Agency in connection with the Merger and the
other Transactions, will not, in the case of the Proxy Statement, at the date
it is first mailed to DPSGs stockholders or at the time of the DPSG

 



      
 

 



 

Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made,
not misleading. The Proxy Statement (except for such portions thereof that
relate only to Maple Parent or any of the Maple Parent Subsidiaries) will
comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 



 

Section 5.18 _Takeover Statutes; Other Restrictions_. As of the date hereof
and assuming the accuracy of Maple Parents representations and warranties in
_Section 4.17_, DPSG has taken all action necessary to exempt this Agreement,
the Merger and the other Transactions from the restrictions on business
combinations in Section 203 of the DGCL, and, accordingly, neither such
section nor any other antitakeover or similar statute or regulation (each, a "
_Takeover Statute_ ") applies to this Agreement, the Merger or the
Transactions. Assuming the accuracy of Maple Parents representations and
warranties in _Section 4.17_, no other "control share acquisition," "fair
price," "moratorium" or other antitakeover Laws enacted under U.S. state or
federal Laws apply to this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



 

Section 5.19 _Intellectual Property_. (a) Except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a DPSG Material Adverse
Effect, DPSG and the DPSG Subsidiaries, collectively, own, license or
otherwise have the right to use, free and clear of all Liens, all Intellectual
Property Rights used in the operation of their respective businesses as
currently conducted (collectively, the " _DPSG IP Rights_ "). The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger
and the other Transactions will not affect ownership of the Intellectual
Property Rights owned or purported to be owned by DPSG or any of the DPSG
Subsidiaries (the " _DPSG Owned IP_ "), except for any adverse effect that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
DPSG Material Adverse Effect. All issued Patents, registered Trademarks and
registered copyrights included in the DPSG Owned IP are subsisting, valid and
enforceable, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a DPSG Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) (i) The conduct of the business as currently conducted by DPSG and the
DPSG Subsidiaries does not infringe, dilute misappropriate or otherwise
violate the Intellectual Property Rights of any third Person, and since
December 31, 2015, there has been no such claim, action or proceeding asserted
or, to DPSGs Knowledge, threatened against DPSG or any of the DPSG
Subsidiaries; (ii) there is no claim, action or proceeding asserted or, to
DPSGs Knowledge, threatened against DPSG or any of theDPSG Subsidiaries that
seeks to cancel, limit or challenge the ownership, validity, registrability,
enforceability, or use of or right to use any DPSG Owned IP and; (iii) to
DPSGs Knowledge, no third Person is infringing, diluting, misappropriating or
otherwise violating any DPSG Owned IP, except, in the case of _clauses (i)_ ,
_(ii)_ and _(iii)_ , as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a DPSG Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) DPSG and each of the DPSG Subsidiaries has taken commercially reasonable
precautions to protect and maintain the confidentiality of all Trade Secrets
included in the DPSG Owned IP (" _Confidential DPSG IP_ "), except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a DPSG
Material Adverse Effect. To DPSGs Knowledge, no Confidential DPSG IP has been
used by or disclosed to any third Person (except

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement or other binding obligation to maintain
confidentiality), except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a DPSG Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) Since December 31, 2015, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a DPSG Material Adverse Effect (i)
DPSG and the DPSG Subsidiaries are in compliance with (A) all of their
respective stated privacy policies and (B) all data protection, privacy and
other applicable Laws that concern the collection, retention, storage,
recording, processing, transfer, sharing or other disposition or use of any
personally identifiable information and no claims have been asserted or
threatened against DPSG or any DPSG Subsidiaries alleging a violation of any
Persons privacy or personal information or data rights, and (ii) there have
not been any security breaches in the information technology systems used by
DPSG and each of the DPSG Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 5.20 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. Prior to the execution of this
Agreement, the DPSG Board has received the oral opinion (to be confirmed in
writing) of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (" _Credit Suisse_ ") to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications
and limitations upon the review undertaken, the consideration (as defined in
such opinion) provided for pursuant to the terms of this Agreement is fair,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of DPSG Common Stock (other
than, to the extent applicable, JAB Holding Company LLC (" _JAB_ "), Mondelēz

of such written opinion will be delivered to Maple Parent solely for
informational purposes reasonably promptly following receipt thereof by DPSG.

 



 

Section 5.21 _Advisors  Fees_. None of DPSG, any of the DPSG Subsidiaries or
any of their respective officers or directors on behalf of DPSG or any DPSG
Subsidiary has employed any Advisor, or incurred any liability for any

with the Merger or other Transactions, other than Credit Suisse and an advisor
to be engaged by DPSG following the date of this Agreement to deliver the
Solvency Opinion (the " _Solvency Advisor_ "). _Section 5.21_ of the DPSG
Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, DPSGs good
faith estimate of the out-of-pocket fees payable by it or any DPSG Subsidiary
to Credit Suisse and the Solvency Advisor in connection with this Agreement,
the Merger and the other Transactions.

including the Debt Financing and the payment of the Special Dividend, the DPSG
Payoff Amount, the Maple Parent Payoff Amount and all other amounts required
to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, and the
payment of all related fees and expenses), DPSG shall be Solvent.

 



 

Section 5.23 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, none of DPSG, any
of the DPSG Subsidiaries or DPSGs Affiliates nor any other Person makes any
express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of DPSG, any of the
DPSG Subsidiaries or DPSGs

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliates or any other Person, and each of DPSG, the DPSG Subsidiaries and
DPSGs Affiliates hereby disclaims any such representation or warranty whether
by DPSG, any of the DPSG Subsidiaries or any of DPSGs Affiliates.

DPSG or any of the DPSG Subsidiaries or direct the business or operations of

in this Agreement will give DPSG, directly or indirectly, the right to control

operations of Maple Parent or any of the Maple Parent Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Maple Parent and DPSG

shall it authorize or permit their respective Representatives directly or
indirectly to:

 



 

(i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage, induce or assist any inquiries or
the making, submission, announcement or consummation of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal;

 



 

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding or provide or furnish any non-public information or
data relating to DPSG or any of the DPSG Subsidiaries, or afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books, records or personnel of DPSG or any of
the DPSG Subsidiaries to any Person (other than Maple Parent or any of its
Affiliates, designees or Representatives) that could reasonably be expected to
initiate, solicit, encourage, induce or assist the making, submission or
commencement of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(iii) approve, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or similar
document, agreement or commitment, or agreement in principle (whether written
or oral, binding or nonbinding) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other
than a confidentiality agreement contemplated by this _Section 6.04_); or

 



 

(iv) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the time
that, but not after, the DPSG Stockholder Approval is obtained, if DPSG has
not materially breached _Section 6.04(a)_, DPSG and the DPSG Subsidiaries and
its and their Representatives may (A) notify any Person of the provisions of
this Section 6.04, (B) provide information (which may include non-public
information) in response to a request therefor by a Person or group of Persons
who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if DPSG
receives from the Person or group of Persons so requesting such information an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms not more favorable to such other
Person or group of Persons than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and which shall not prohibit DPSG from complying with the terms of
this _Section 6.04_, and prior to or promptly thereafter delivers to Maple
Parent any such information to the extent not previously provided to Maple
Parent and (C) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with
any Person or group of Persons who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, prior to taking any
action described in clauses (B) and (C) above, the DPSG Board has determined
in good faith based on the information then available and (x) after
consultation with DPSGs outside legal

 



       
 

 



 

counsel that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
(y) after consultation with DPSGs outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal, indication of interest or offer
(other than from Maple Parent of its Affiliates) relating to or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to (i) a merger, joint venture, partnership,
consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, exchange offer,
recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business combination or
similar transaction or series of related transactions involving DPSG or any of
its significant subsidiaries (as such term is defined in Rule 1-02 of
Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act) in which a Person (or stockholders of
any Person, taken as a whole) directly or indirectly would acquire beneficial
ownership of (y) 20% or more of the outstanding DPSG Common Stock or (z) 20%
or more of the aggregate voting power of the surviving entity or a resulting
direct or indirect parent of DPSG or such surviving entity, (ii) any
acquisition by any Person which if consummated would result in any Person
becoming the beneficial ownership of, directly or indirectly, in one or a
series of related transactions, 20% or more of the total voting power or of
any class of equity securities of DPSG, or (iii) the acquisition, purchase or
disposition of 20% or more of the consolidated assets (measured on a fair
market value basis) (including equity securities of the DPSG Subsidiaries),
revenues, net income or earnings of DPSG and its Subsidiaries outside the
ordinary course of business, in each case other than the Transactions.

 



 

" _Intervening Event_ " means an event, development or change in circumstances
material to DPSG and the DPSG Subsidiaries taken as a whole, becoming known to
the DPSG Board after the date of this Agreement, but prior to the approval of
the DPSG Charter Amendment and the DPSG Stock Issuance by the DPSG
Stockholders Approval, that relates to DPSG (but does not relate to any
Acquisition Proposal); provided, however, that in no event shall any change
in, or event or condition generally affecting, the industry in which DPSG
operates that has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have a
disproportionate effect on DPSG constitute an Intervening Event.

 



 

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal that would result in any Person (or its stockholders) becoming the
beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the consolidated
assets (measured on a fair market value basis) of DPSG and its Subsidiaries or
more than 50% of the total voting power of the equity securities of DPSG that
the DPSG Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with DPSGs
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, taking into account,
among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects
of the Acquisition Proposal and the Person making the Acquisition Proposal
(including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, the
availability of financing, and any conditions to consummation relating to
financing, regulatory approvals or other conditions beyond the control of the
party having the right to invoke the condition) and other aspect of the
Acquisition Proposal that the DPSG Board deems relevant (i) is more favorable
to DPSGs stockholders from a financial point of view than the Transactions
(after taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed

 



      
 

 



 

by Maple Parent and any other information provided by Maple Parent pursuant to
_Section 6.04(c)_) and (ii) is reasonably likely to be consummated.

officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants,
consultants and other advisors or representatives.

(i) (A) fail to include the DPSG Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (B)
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Maple Parent,
the DPSG Recommendation, (C) publicly approve, recommend or otherwise declare
advisable any Acquisition Proposal or (D) publicly propose to do any of the
foregoing (any action or omission described in this subsection _(i)_ being
referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_ "); or

 



 

(ii) authorize, approve, recommend, declare advisable or permit (or publicly
propose to authorize, approve, recommend, declare advisable or permit) DPSG to
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or agreement relating to
any Acquisition Proposal (other than this Agreement or a confidentiality
agreement entered into in compliance with and subject to the limitations set
forth in _Section 6.04(a)_) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the DPSG Stockholders Meeting, the DPSG Board may make a Change of
Recommendation and, solely with respect to a Superior Proposal, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(h)_ if and only if (A) in connection with
a Change of Recommendation, the DPSG Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with DPSGs outside legal counsel) that the failure to make a
Change of Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (B) DPSG complies
with the provisions of this _Section 6.04(c)_, it being understood that the
board of directors of DPSG may make a Change of Recommendation only in
response to (1) any Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal
or (2) an Intervening Event; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such action may
be taken pursuant to this _Section 6.04(c)_ or _Section 9.01(h)_ until after
the fourth Business Day following Maple Parents receipt of notice (which
notice shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation) from DPSG (as may be
extended or renewed pursuant to this paragraph, the " _Notice Period_ ")
containing the action proposed to be taken and the basis therefor, including
(i) in the case of an Acquisition Proposal, all necessary information under
Section 6.04(f) (which notice shall not constitute a Change of
Recommendation), the current version of the agreement documenting such
Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person or group of Persons making
such Acquisition Proposal and (ii) in the case of an Intervening Event, a
reasonably detailed description of the Intervening Event; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that (i) during the Notice Period, DPSG shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement,
(ii) DPSG shall negotiate, and shall direct its financial advisors and outside
legal

 



      
 

 



 

counsel to negotiate, with Maple Parent in good faith during the Notice Period
(to the extent Maple Parent desires to negotiate) to enable Maple Parent to
propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement that obviate the need of the
DPSG Board to make a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.01(h)_, including in the case of a Superior Proposal,
by such Superior Proposal no longer constituting a Superior Proposal, (iii)
following the end of the Notice Period, the DPSG Board shall have considered
in good faith any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Maple
Parent and any other information provided by Maple Parent and shall have
determined that, if such changes were to be given effect, in the case of a
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(h)_ (after
consultation with DPSGs outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel), any such Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior
Proposal and, after consultation with DPSGs outside legal counsel, a failure
to make a Change of Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law or, in
the case of a Change in Recommendation (after consultation with DPSGs outside
legal counsel), the failure to make such Change of Recommendation would
continue to reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (iv) in the event of modifications
to the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of
consideration) or any other material terms of any Superior Proposal, DPSG
shall, in each case, have delivered to Maple Parent an additional notice
consistent with that described in the first proviso of this paragraph, and a
new Notice Period under this paragraph shall commence, during which time DPSG
shall be required to comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.04(c)_
anew with respect to such additional notice, including clauses (i) through
(iv) of this proviso, _provided_ that any such additional Notice Period shall
end after the third Business Day following Maple Parents receipt of such
notice from DPSG. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that a notice
required under this _Section 6.04(c)_ (in connection with a termination
pursuant to _Section 9.01(h)_) relates to a Superior Proposal for which the
requisite notice or additional notice has been given pursuant to this _Section
6.04(c)_ (in connection with a Change of Recommendation), no new or additional
notice or Notice Period will be required for such termination pursuant to
_Section 9.01(h)_.

 



 

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.04_
shall be deemed to prohibit DPSG from complying with its disclosure
obligations under United States federal or state Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if such disclosure does not reaffirm the DPSG Recommendation or has the
substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the DPSG
Recommendation, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change of
Recommendation and Maple Parent shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement as set forth in _Section 9.01_ (it being understood that any "stop,
look or listen" communication that contains only the information set forth in
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to have the
substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the DPSG
Recommendation or otherwise deemed to violate DPSGs obligations under this
_Section 6.04(d)_).

 



 

(e) _Existing Discussions and Agreements_. DPSG agrees that it will, and will
cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors and officers to,
and will direct, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause, its and its
Subsidiaries other Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. DPSG also agrees that (i)
it will promptly request each Person that has executed a confidentiality
agreement prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

date of this Agreement in connection with such Persons consideration of an
Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person or its Representatives by or on behalf of
DPSG or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such consideration, (ii)
DPSG and its Subsidiaries shall not release any party from, or terminate,
waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, any
confidentiality or standstill provision in any agreement to which DPSG or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the DPSG
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
it would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the board of
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law not to do so, DPSG may waive
any standstill or similar provisions in such agreements to the extent
necessary to permit a Person to make, on a non-public basis to the DPSG Board,
an Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon such Person agreeing to disclosure
of such Acquisition Proposal to Maple Parent, in each case as contemplated by
and subject to compliance with this _Section 6.04(e)_ and (iii) subject to
the proviso in the immediately preceding clause (ii), DPSG shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any such
agreement, including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of such
provisions and to enforce specifically such provisions thereof in any court of
the United States of America or of any state having jurisdiction. Nothing
contained in this _Section 6.04(e)_ shall be deemed to prohibit DPSG from
disclosing any information to the extent necessary to comply with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law or any disclosure obligations under
applicable U.S. federal or state Law.

 



 

(f) _Notice_. DPSG agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within 24
hours) notify Maple Parent if any inquiries, proposals or offers are received
by, any such information is requested from, or any such discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its
Representatives, in each case, with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including copies of
any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and
thereafter shall keep Maple Parent reasonably informed, on a timely basis, of
the status and material terms of any such proposals or offers (including any
amendments thereto and, in no event later than 24 hours after receipt, copies
of any additional or revised written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations,
including any change in DPSGs intentions as previously notified. DPSG agrees
that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date hereof that prohibits DPSG from providing any
information to Maple Parent in accordance with this _Section 6.04(f)_.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or _Section 6.04(a)_, DPSG
shall notify Maple Parent in advance of beginning to provide information to
any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal or beginning discussions or
negotiations with any Person regarding an Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(g) Any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.04_ by any
director or officer of DPSG or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a
breach of this _Section 6.04_ by DPSG.

 



 

Section 6.05 _Conduct of Maple Parent Business Prior to Effective Time_.
During the Interim Period, except as required by Law or GAAP, as expressly
contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, as specifically set forth in
_Section 6.05_ of the Maple Parent

 



      
 

 



 

Disclosure Letter, or as consented to in writing by DPSG (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Maple Parent will, and will
cause each Maple Parent Subsidiary to, (a) conduct its business in the
ordinary course in all material respects and (b) use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain and preserve intact its business organization and
advantageous business relationships.

 



 

Section 6.06 _Forbearances_. During the Interim Period, except as required by
Law or GAAP, as expressly contemplated or permitted by this Agreement or as
consented to in writing by DPSG (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), Maple Parent will not, and will not permit any of the
Maple Parent Subsidiaries to:

 



 

(a) enter into any new line of business that is material to Maple Parent and
the Maple Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

 



 

(b) take any action that would, or would be reasonably likely to, individually
or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions; or

 



 

(c) agree, commit, or resolve to take any of the actions prohibited by this
_Section 6.06_.

appropriate consents, waivers and approvals under any DPSG Material Contracts
or Maple Parent Material Contracts, as applicable, to which DPSG or any of its
Subsidiaries, or Maple Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, is a
party in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions so as to maintain and preserve the benefits under such DPSG
Material Contracts or Maple Parent Material Contracts following the
consummation of the Transactions. In addition to the foregoing, DPSG shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
to obtain the Solvency Opinion from the Solvency Advisor in satisfaction of
the condition set forth in _Section 8.03(f)_. In addition to the foregoing,
neither DPSG, Merger Sub nor Maple Parent, on the one hand, nor, except for
actions taken in accordance with _Section 6.04_, DPSG, on the other hand,
shall take any action, or fail to

 



      
 

 



 

take any action, that is intended to, or has (or would reasonably be expected
to have) the effect of, preventing, impairing, materially delaying or
otherwise adversely affecting the consummation of the Merger or the ability of
such party to fully perform its obligations under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither DPSG nor Maple Parent
shall be required prior to the Effective Time to pay any consent or other
similar fee, or other similar payment or other consideration (including
increased rent or other similar payments) to obtain the consent, waiver or
approval of any Person under any Contract.

 



 

Section 7.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Law and reasonable
limitations limiting access to outside counsel, DPSG shall, and shall cause
each of the DPSG Subsidiaries, to, afford to Maple Parent and the Maple Parent
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives reasonable access, during
the Interim Period, to all their respective properties, books, Contracts,
personnel and records and, during such period, DPSG shall, and shall cause
each of the DPSG Subsidiaries to, (i) furnish promptly to Maple Parent all

Maple Parent may reasonably request, and (ii) engage with Maple Parent and the
Maple Parent Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives on integration

ordinary course of business) and in accordance with _Section 6.04_ (provided
that DPSG and the DPSG Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or disclosure),
(B) the disclosure of which would violate any Law or fiduciary duty (provided
that DPSG and the DPSG Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to
make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not
in violation of any Law or fiduciary duty), (C) that is subject to attorney-
client or other privilege (provided that DPSG and the DPSG Subsidiaries shall
use their reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to
the maximum extent that would not result in a waiver of any such attorney-
client or other privilege), (D) concerning Acquisition Proposals, which shall
be governed by _Section 6.04_, or (E) regarding the deliberations of the DPSG
Board or any committee thereof with respect to the Transactions or the entry

(b) All information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 7.02_ shall be
subject to the confidentiality agreement dated October 12, 2017, between DPSG
and Maple Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). For the avoidance of
doubt, neither the foregoing nor any other provision of this Agreement or the

made by Maple Parent and its Affiliates to the Financing Sources, rating
agencies, prospective traders, existing lenders (and related agents) or
otherwise in connection with efforts or activities to obtaining the Debt
Financing.

Agreement, each of DPSG, Merger Sub and Maple Parent shall use its reasonable

be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate the Merger and make effective all of the other Transactions, as
soon as practicable after the date hereof, including preparing and filing, in

extensions thereof) as soon as practicable (including by requesting early
termination of the waiting period thereunder) and (ii) each of Maple Parent
and DPSG agree, as applicable, to (A) cooperate and to provide each other with
information as reasonably requested to determine whether any other waiting
period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses,

Antitrust Law (collectively, " _Antitrust Clearances_ "), may be necessary to
consummate the merger and (B) file as promptly as practicable all

its Subsidiaries be required pursuant to this _Section 7.03_ to agree to or
take any such actions, restrictions or conditions with respect to obtaining
any consents, registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting
periods or authorizations in connection with the Merger and the other
Transactions unless such actions are effective after or conditioned upon the
Effective Time. Maple Parent shall have the right to direct all matters with
any Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations hereunder; _provided_
, that, subject to reasonable limitations limiting access to outside counsel,
Maple Parent and DPSG shall have the right to review in advance and, to the

faith the views of the other in connection with, any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to or other communication with any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions (and to
receive a copy of all documents and information submitted to such Governmental
Entity). In exercising the foregoing rights, each of DPSG and Maple Parent
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

contained in this _Section 7.03_, Maple Parent shall take, and cause its
Affiliates to take all steps as may be necessary to obtain all required
Antitrust Clearances, including accepting operational restrictions or
limitations on, and committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate orders, trust or otherwise, the sale, license, disposition or holding
separate of, such assets or businesses of Maple Parent, Merger Sub, DPSG, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates (and the entry
into agreements with, and submission to decrees, judgments, injunctions or
orders of such Governmental Entity) as may be required to obtain such
Antitrust Clearances or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of
or vacate or lift, any decrees, judgments, injunctions or orders under any
Antitrust Laws that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the consummation of the Transactions, including the
Merger.

 



 

(c) _Antitrust Matters_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to
this _Section 7.03_, each of Maple Parent and DPSG agree to promptly provide
to each and every federal, state or foreign Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any Antitrust Laws non-privileged information
and documents that are necessary, proper and advisable to permit the
consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

(d) _Information_. Subject to reasonable limitations limiting access to
outside counsel, DPSG and Maple Parent each shall, upon request by the other,
furnish the other promptly with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Maple Parent, DPSG or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions.

 



 

(e) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and as required by any Governmental
Entity or rules and regulations of NYSE, and subject to reasonable
restrictions limiting access to outside counsel, DPSG and Maple Parent each
shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion
of the Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices, correspondence, or other communications received by Maple Parent or
DPSG, as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other
Transactions. Neither DPSG nor Maple Parent shall permit any of its officers
or any other Representatives or agents to participate in any meeting or engage
in any substantive communication with any Governmental Entity in respect of
any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to the Transactions
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate thereat. Each of DPSG and Maple Parent shall, to the
extent practicable, give the other reasonable prior notice of any such meeting
or communication and in the event one party is prohibited by Law, a
Governmental Entity or rules and regulations of NYSE from participating in or
attending any such meeting or engaging in any such communication, keep such
party reasonably apprised with respect thereto.

in _Section 7.05_ to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official
notice of issuance prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(g) _Litigation_. DPSG shall give Maple Parent the opportunity to participate
in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against DPSG or its
directors relating to the Merger and the other Transactions, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to by DPSG without the prior written consent of

delayed).

 



 

Section 7.04 _Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting_.

 



 

(a) In accordance with the DGCL, the DPSG Charter, the DPSG By-laws, the
Exchange Act, and any applicable rules and regulations of NYSE, DPSG, in
consultation with Maple Parent, shall call, give notice of, convene and hold
the DPSG Stockholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the date upon which the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC (with the record
date and meeting date to be set by the board of directors of DPSG after
consultation with Maple Parent regarding such dates) and shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, for the purpose
of obtaining the DPSG Stockholders Approval, duly set a record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at the DPSG
Stockholders Meeting (such date to be at least 20 Business Days following the
initiation of a broker search pursuant to Rule 14a-13 under the Exchange Act).
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the DPSG Board of Directors shall
recommend that the stockholders of DPSG vote in favor of the approval of the
DPSG Charter Amendment and the DPSG Stock Issuance. DPSG shall comply with the
DGCL, the DPSG Charter and DPSG By-laws, the Exchange Act, and the rules and
regulations of NYSE in connection with the DPSG Stockholders Meeting,
including preparing and delivering the Proxy Statement to DPSGs stockholders,
as required pursuant to the Exchange Act and _Section 7.04(b)_ below. Subject
to the terms of this Agreement, unless there has been a Change of
Recommendation, DPSG shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit
(or cause to be solicited) from its stockholders proxies constituting the DPSG
Stockholders Approval. DPSG shall not change the date of, postpone or adjourn
the DPSG Stockholders Meeting without the consent of Maple Parent (which may
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that,
without Maple Parents consent, DPSG may adjourn or postpone the DPSG
Stockholders Meeting as may be required by applicable Law and no more than two
times (i) to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is provided to DPSGs stockholders within a reasonable amount of
time in advance of the DPSG Stockholders Meeting, (ii) to allow reasonable
additional time to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of approval
of the DPSG Charter Amendment and the DPSG Stock Issuance, (iii) if as of the
time for which the DPSG Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set
forth in the Proxy Statement) or the time scheduled for reconvening the DPSG
Stockholders Meeting, there are insufficient shares of DPSG Capital Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the DPSG Stockholders Meeting or at such time DPSG has
not received proxies sufficient to allow the receipt of the DPSG Stockholders
Approval at the DPSG Stockholders Meeting, or (iv) as required by applicable
Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that the DPSG Stockholders Meeting shall not be
postponed, recessed or adjourned pursuant to this proviso to a date that is
more than 30 days after the date on which the DPSG Stockholders Meeting was
originally scheduled without the prior written consent of Maple

 



      
 

 



 

Parent. Maple Parent may cause DPSG to postpone or adjourn the DPSG
Stockholders Meeting by prior written notice to DPSG once for a period of no
longer than ten Business Days and at such time DPSG has not received proxies
sufficient to allow the receipt of the DPSG Stockholders Approval at the DPSG
Stockholders Meeting and Maple Parent informs DPSG that Maple Parent believes
in good faith that additional time is required to solicit stockholder proxies
in favor of approval of the DPSG Charter Amendment and the DPSG Stock
Issuance.

 



 

(b) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, DPSG, with the assistance
of Maple Parent, shall prepare, and DPSG shall file with the SEC, the
preliminary Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to each of DPSG and Maple Parent
relating to the Merger and the Transactions. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement, the Proxy Statement shall reflect the DPSG Recommendation and shall
include a description of the other Board Actions. Maple Parent shall, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives and
Affiliates to, cooperate with DPSG in the preparation of the preliminary Proxy
Statement and the definitive Proxy Statement and shall furnish to DPSG all
information relating to it required by the Exchange Act for inclusion in, or
to assist DPSG in preparing, the Proxy Statement (and responding to any
comments from the SEC or its staff with respect thereto), including without
limitation, such financial statements and other information relating to it and
its Affiliates required to be included in the Proxy Statement by Regulation
14A under the Exchange Act or other applicable Law to be included in the Proxy
Statement. In addition, Maple Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its independent accountants to provide assistance and cooperation to
DPSG in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement, including
without limitation, to the extent required by applicable Law, providing
consent to DPSG to include their audit reports in the Proxy Statement and
providing reasonable assistance in the preparation of pro forma financial
statements to be included in the Proxy Statement. DPSG shall promptly provide
Maple Parent and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall
inform them of any oral comments, that DPSG or its counsel may receive from
the SEC or its staff with respect to any preliminary Proxy Statement, and DPSG
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, after consultation with and
with the assistance of Maple Parent, to respond as promptly as practicable to
any such comments of the SEC or its staff and to cause the Proxy Statement in
definitive form to be mailed to DPSGs stockholders at the earliest
practicable time. Each of DPSG and Maple Parent shall promptly advise the
other if it determines that any information provided by it for use in the
Proxy Statement was or shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect and shall promptly notify the other if it becomes aware of any
material fact not contained in the Proxy Statement and required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. DPSG shall take all
steps necessary to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of shares of DPSG Capital Stock, in
each case as, and to the extent, required by applicable Law. DPSG shall
promptly provide Maple Parent and its counsel with copies of any written
comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that DPSG or its counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff requesting any amendments or supplements
to the preliminary Proxy Statement or the definitive Proxy Statement, and DPSG
and Maple Parent shall cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff, and if
required by applicable Law, DPSG shall mail to its stockholders, as promptly
as reasonably practicable, such amendment or supplement. DPSG shall provide
Maple Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review any written
responses to all SEC comments with respect to a preliminary or definitive
Proxy Statement and

 



       
 

 



 

DPSG shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by Maple Parent and its counsel.

 



 

Section 7.05 _DPSG Stock Plan_. As of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each outstanding award issued under a DPSG Stock Plan shall vest, with DPSG
PSUs vesting at target performance levels or at such higher performance levels
as may be required pursuant to the applicable terms of a DPSG Benefit Plan.
Prior to the Dividend Record Time, the DPSG Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof administering the DPSG Stock Plan) shall adopt such
resolutions as may be required to cause, as of the Effective Time, (a) except
as set forth in _Section 7.06(c)_, each DPSG Stock Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Dividend Record Time to be converted into a right of
the holder of such DPSG Stock Option to receive, on or as soon as
administratively practicable following the Effective Time and less applicable
Tax withholding, (i) a number of shares of DPSG Common Stock equal to the
number of shares underlying such DPSG Stock Option and (ii) an amount in cash
equal to (A) the number of shares underlying such DPSG Stock Option
_multiplied by_ (B) (1) the Special Dividend Per Share Amount, reduced (but
not below zero) by (2) the exercise price per share of such DPSG Stock Option
immediately prior to the Dividend Record Time, and (b) each DPSG RSU and DPSG
PSU to be settled in exchange for (i) a number of shares of DPSG Common Stock
equal to the number of shares underlying such DPSG RSU or DPSG PSU, as the
case may be, and (ii) an amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares
underlying such DPSG RSU or DPSG PSU, as the case may be _multiplied by_ (B)
the Special Dividend Per Share Amount, delivered to the holder of such DPSG
RSU or DPSG PSU, as the case may be, on or as soon as administratively
possible following the Effective Time and less applicable Tax withholding. All
shares of DPSG Common Stock issued pursuant to this _Section 7.05_ shall be
fully vested. Except as set forth in _Section 7.06(c)_, as of the Effective
Time, there shall be no rights outstanding under a DPSG Benefit Plan to
acquire DPSG Common Stock.

 



 

Section 7.06 _Maple RSUs_.

 



 

(a) Each compensatory restricted stock unit with respect to shares of Maple
Common Stock (a " _Maple RSU_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
consummation of the Maple Parent Restructuring shall be converted as part of
the Maple Parent Restructuring into a restricted stock unit with respect to
Maple Parent Shares (each, a " _Maple Parent RSU_ "), with the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such Maple RSU immediately prior to the
consummation of the Maple Parent Restructuring, and relating to the number of
Maple Parent Shares equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Maple
Common Stock subject to such Maple RSU immediately prior to the consummation
of the Maple Parent Restructuring and (ii) the exchange ratio applicable to
shares of Maple Common Stock in the merger of Maple into Maple Parent pursuant
to the Maple Parent Restructuring, with any fractional shares rounded to the
next whole number of shares. Any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents with
respect to any Maple RSU will be assumed and become an obligation with respect
to the applicable Maple Parent RSU.

 



 

(b) As of the Effective Time, each Maple Parent RSU that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including the Maple Parent RSUs
issued pursuant to _Section 7.06(a)_) shall be converted into a restricted
stock unit with respect to DPSG Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted Maple
Parent RSU_ "), with the same terms and conditions as

 



      
 

 



 

were applicable under such Maple Parent RSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and relating to the number of shares of DPSG Common Stock equal to the
product of (i) the number of Maple Parent Shares subject to such Maple Parent
RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, with
any fractional shares rounded to the next whole number of shares. Any accrued
but unpaid dividend equivalents with respect to any Maple Parent RSU will be
assumed and become an obligation with respect to the applicable Adjusted Maple
Parent RSU.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, each of DPSG and Maple Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take such actions with respect to the equity
compensation plans or arrangements of DPSG and Maple, respectively, as are
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by _Section 7.05_
and this _Section 7.06_ (including, without limitation, the consent of the
option holders to the option treatment set forth in _Section 7.05_). If,
following such efforts, DPSG is unable to obtain option holder consent to the
option treatment set forth in _Section 7.05_, and the DPSG Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the DPSG Stock Plan) shall,
after consultation with Maple Parent, adjust each DPSG Stock Option in a
manner that preserves the intrinsic value of such DPSG Stock Option after
taking into account the Special Dividend. Any failure of DPSG to obtain the
option holder consent to the option treatment set forth in _Section 7.05_
with respect to any DPSG Stock Option shall not be deemed to be a breach of
this Agreement.

 



 

(d) DPSG shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are
necessary for the conversion of the Maple RSUs pursuant to this _Section
7.06_, including the reservation, issuance and listing of DPSG Common Stock as
is necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this _Section
7.06_. DPSG shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on an
appropriate form, or a post-effective amendment to a registration statement
previously filed under the 1933 Act, with respect to the shares of DPSG Common
Stock subject to the Adjusted Maple Parent RSUs.

 



 

Section 7.07 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Each employee of DPSG and the DPSG Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time who continues to be employed with DPSG or its Subsidiaries
after consummation of the Merger (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") shall, during
the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the date that is 12
months following Closing (or such earlier date that such employee ceases to be
a Continuing Employee), be provided with (i) base salary or base wages, as
applicable, that are no less favorable than the base salary or base wages
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(ii) cash bonus and other short-term incentive compensation opportunities that
are no less favorable than the cash bonus and other short-term incentive
compensation opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (iii) a long-term incentive compensation award
opportunity (which may be provided in the form of equity or cash) that is no
less favorable (without regard to vesting terms) than the long-term incentive
compensation award opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that long-term incentive
compensation awards granted in 2019 to Continuing Employees with a title below
director, notwithstanding this _Section 7.07(a)(iii)_, shall not be required
to exceed $3,800,000; and (iv) severance benefits that are no less favorable
than

 



      
 

 



 

the severance benefits provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Each Continuing Employee shall, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2018 (or such earlier date that such
employee ceases to be a Continuing Employee), be provided with employee
benefits (other than benefits subject to the provisions of _Section 7.07(a)_)
that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided
to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the terms and
conditions of employment for those Continuing Employees covered by an
effective Collective Bargaining Agreement as of the Effective Date, shall
continue to be governed by such Collective Bargaining Agreement.

 



 

(c) Each employee eligible to participate in the DPSG Management Incentive
Plan or any other incentive compensation plan, shall be entitled to receive,
at such time as payments with respect to calendar year 2018 would normally be
paid without regard to the Transactions, a payment equal to the greater of
such employees (i) pro-rata target under the DPSG Management Incentive Plan
or other incentive compensation plan for the period between January 1, 2018
and the Closing Date and (ii) the actual incentive award for such period under
the DPSG Management Incentive Plan or other incentive compensation plan,
provided that such employee has either remained employed by DPSG or any DPSG
Subsidiary through December 31, 2018, or such employees employment has
terminated under such circumstances as would, under the applicable terms of
the DPSG Management Incentive Plan or other incentive compensation plan,
entitle such employee to receive a payment under such plan with respect to
calendar year 2018 notwithstanding such termination of employment. Prior to
the Effective Time, Maple Parent and DPSG shall negotiate in good faith to
establish new incentive compensation plans (the " _Replacement 2018 Incentive
Compensation Plans_ ") with respect to the portion of the 2018 calendar year
following the Effective Date applicable to each Continuing Employee eligible
to participate in the DPSG Management Incentive Plan for 2018 or any other
incentive compensation plan. The Replacement 2018 Incentive Compensation Plans
shall in each case be no less favorable to each eligible Continuing Employee
than the incentive compensation plan or plans provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, after taking into account
the effect of the Transactions and the payments contemplated by the first
sentence of this _Section 7.07(c)_.

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, DPSG shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any pre-existing conditions
or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans
with respect to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, (ii)
credit each Continuing Employee for the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs for applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical
expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has been made
and (iii) credit each Continuing Employee with service credit for such
Continuing Employees employment for purposes of vesting, benefit accrual and
eligibility to participate under each applicable benefit plan, as if such
service had been performed with DPSG, provided, that the foregoing shall not
apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i) be treated as an
amendment of any particular DPSG Benefit Plan or Maple Parent Benefit Plan,
(ii) prevent the parties from amending or terminating any of their benefit
plans in accordance with their terms, (iii) prevent the parties after the
Effective Time, from terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee, or
(iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of DPSG or the
DPSG Subsidiaries or Maple Parent or the Maple Parent Subsidiaries or any
beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective bargaining representative
thereof.

 



 

Section 7.08 _Debt Matters_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, each of DPSG and the DPSG Subsidiaries shall, and
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective

(vi) except as provided in _Sections 7.08(h)_ and _(i)_ , if reasonably

(ix) reasonably cooperating with Maple Parent to satisfy the conditions

extent within the control of DPSG or the DPSG Subsidiaries, and taking of

(x) preventing the offer or placement of any debt securities or commercial

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) such requested cooperation shall not
unreasonably interfere in any material respect with the business or the
ongoing operations of DPSG and/or the DPSG Subsidiaries, (ii) nothing in
_Section 7.08_ shall (A) require cooperation to the extent that it would
reasonably be expected to conflict with or violate any applicable Law or

reasonable efforts to provide notice to Maple Parent promptly upon obtaining
knowledge that such information is being withheld (but solely if providing
such notice would not violate such obligation of confidentiality)), (iii)
neither DPSG nor any DPSG Subsidiary shall be required to pay or incur any
commitment or other similar fee or incur or assume any other liability or
obligation in connection with any Debt Financing or any offering of Debt
Securities (except the obligation to deliver the solvency certificate and
customary authorization and representation letters referenced in _Section
7.08(a)(v)_ and the obligations to issue notices of redemption and other
notices, officers certificates and opinions with respect to the Redemption
set forth in _Section 7.08(i) _below), in each case other than as are
contingent upon the Closing or which are concurrently reimbursed by Maple
Parent, (iv) none of the directors of DPSG or any DPSG Subsidiary that will
not be continuing directors, acting in such capacity, shall be required to
authorize or adopt any resolutions approving the agreements, documents,
instruments, actions and transactions contemplated in connection with the Debt
Financing that would be effective prior to the Effective Time, (v) provide
access to or disclose information that DPSG reasonably determines would
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or the attorney-work product doctrine
in favor of DPSG or any of its subsidiaries and (vi) none of DPSG, DPSGs
Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers, employees or agents,
shall be required to execute, deliver or enter into, or perform any agreement,
document or instrument (other than the solvency certificate and customary

the Debt Financing or any offering of Debt Securities that is not contingent
upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time;
provided however that the foregoing clause (vi) of this sentence shall not

to the Effective Time or contain additional conditions to the closing or

required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act prior to the
Closing Date in accordance with the time periods required by the Exchange Act.

 



 

(c) Maple Parent shall (i) promptly upon request by DPSG, reimburse DPSG for

_Section 7.08_ and (ii) except as a result of gross negligence, fraud,
willful misconduct of or material breach of this Agreement by DPSG, the DPSG

arising from information furnished in writing by or on behalf of DPSG and/or
its Subsidiaries (including financial statements and audits thereof),
indemnify DPSG, the DPSG Subsidiaries, its or their respective Affiliates and
its and their respective Representatives against any claim, loss, damage,
injury, liability, judgment, award, penalty, fine, Tax, cost (including cost
of investigation), expense (including reasonable and documented fees and
expenses of counsel) or settlement payment of any kind, incurred, imposed on,
sustained, suffered by or asserted against, any of them, directly or
indirectly relating to, arising out of or resulting from the Debt Financing,
the performance by DPSG, any DPSG Subsidiaries, its and their respective
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives of any obligations set
forth in this _Section 7.08_ and any information utilized in connection
therewith and such Representatives shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 7.08_.

 



 

(d) Unless, and to the extent, Maple Parent shall have sufficient cash from
other sources (including the Equity Financing and/or by reason of a capital
market or other financing transaction) available to pay the Required Amount,
Maple Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Debt Commitment Letter pursuant to its terms, (ii) negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or on other terms
agreed by Maple Parent (subject to the restrictions on amendments of the Debt
Commitment Letter set forth in _Section 7.08(e)_ below), and (iii) satisfy
(or, seek a waiver on a timely basis of) all conditions to funding in the Debt
Commitment Letter that are within its control and, in the event that all
conditions to funding in the Debt Commitment Letter are satisfied at or prior
to Closing, consummate the Debt Financing and cause the Financing Sources to
fund the Financing at the Closing. Maple Parent shall keep DPSG reasonably
informed on a reasonably timely basis and in reasonable detail of the status
of its efforts to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing. Maple Parent shall
promptly provide DPSG with copies of agreements relating to the Debt Financing
and such other information and documentation regarding such Debt Financing as
reasonably requested by DPSG to allow DPSG to monitor the progress of such
financing activities. Without limiting the foregoing, Maple Parent shall
notify DPSG promptly if at any time prior to the Effective Time: (A) the Debt
Commitment Letter or other definitive financing agreements with respect
thereto expire or are terminated for any reason (other than in accordance

 



      
 

 



 

with their terms by reason of an issuance of Debt Securities or other
financing transactions that comply with Section 7.08(e) below), (B) Maple
Parent obtains knowledge of any material breach or default by any party to any
Debt Commitment Letter (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any material breach or default thereunder), (C) Maple Parent receives any
written communication from any Financing Source providing the Debt Financing
with respect to any (1) actual, potential or threatened breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter with
respect to the obligation to fund the Debt Financing or (2) a material dispute
or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment Letter
with respect to the obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the amount of the
Debt Financing to be funded at the Closing or (D) if Maple Parent, for any
reason, otherwise no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to
obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms described in the
Debt Commitment Letter (except as the result of the issuance of any Debt
Securities or the effectiveness of any other financing transaction that
complies with _Section 7.08(e)_ below). As soon as reasonably practicable
after DPSG delivers to Maple Parent a written request therefor, Maple Parent
shall provide any information reasonably requested by DPSG relating to any
circumstance referred to in clause (A) through (D) of the immediately
preceding sentence; provided, that neither Maple Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall be under any obligation to disclose any information that is
subject to attorney client or similar privilege to the extent such privilege
is asserted in good faith or otherwise would violate or contravene any law,
rule or regulation or any obligation of confidentiality.

 



 

(e) Unless, and to the extent, Maple Parent shall have sufficient immediately
and unconditionally available cash from other sources (including the Equity
Financing and/or by reason of capital markets, securities or other financing
transactions) available to pay the Required Amount, from and after the
execution of this Agreement, Maple Parent shall not amend, modify, replace,
terminate or agree to any waiver under the Debt Commitment Letter without the
prior written approval of DPSG if such amendment, replacement, modification,
termination or waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing such that the aggregate funds that would be available on the Closing
Date, together with other immediately and unconditionally available sources,
would not be sufficient to pay the Required Amount, (ii) impose new or
additional conditions to the Debt Financing or otherwise expand, amend, modify
or waive any of the conditions to the Debt Financing (unless such expanded,
amended or modified conditions could not be reasonably expected to prevent,
impede or delay the funding of the Debt Financing or impose additional
material obligations upon DPSG or any DPSG Subsidiary), or (iii) otherwise
expand, amend, modify or waive any provision of the Debt Commitment Letter in
a manner that in any such case would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or
make less likely the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to the Debt Financing) on the Closing Date or (B) adversely impact
the ability of Maple Parent to enforce or cause the enforcement of its rights
against the Financing Sources; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, Maple Parent may modify, supplement or amend the Debt Commitment
Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date of this Agreement. In the event that new commitment letters and/or fee
letters are entered into in accordance with any amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification of the Debt Commitment Letter permitted
pursuant to this _Section 7.08(e)_ such new commitment letters and/or fee
letters shall be deemed to be the "Debt Commitment Letter" for all purposes of
this Agreement and references to "Debt Financing" herein shall include and
mean the financing contemplated by the Debt

 



      
 

 



 

Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified,
as applicable. Maple Parent shall promptly deliver to DPSG copies of any
termination, amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of the Debt
Commitment Letter.

 



 

(f) Unless, and to the extent, Maple Parent shall have immediately and
unconditionally available cash from other sources (including by reason of a
capital market or other financing transaction) available to pay the Required
Amount, in the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Maple
Parent shall promptly notify DPSG in writing and use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange alternative financing from the same or alternative sources
in an amount not less than the unavailable portion of the Debt Financing (the
" _Alternative Financing_ "); _provided_ , however, that Maple Parent shall
not be required to obtain financing which includes terms and conditions
materially less favorable (taken as whole and taking into account any "market
flex" provision) to DPSG and Maple Parent, taken as a whole, in each case
relative to those in the Debt Financing being replaced. Upon obtaining any
commitment for any such Alternative Financing, such financing shall be deemed
to be a part of the "Debt Financing" and any commitment and fee letters for
such Alternative Financing shall be deemed the "Debt Commitment Letter" for
all purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(g) DPSG hereby consents to use of its and its Subsidiaries logos on customary
marketing materials in connection with the Debt Financing or any offering of
Debt Securities; _provided_ , that such logos are used solely in a manner that
is not intended nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage DPSG or any of its
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of DPSG or any of its Subsidiaries
or their respective logos.

 



 

(h) On or prior to the Closing, DPSG shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause the agent under each of DPSG Credit Facilities to provide a copy of an
executed payoff letter (each a " _DPSG Payoff Letter_ ") with respect to each
of the DPSG Credit Facilities, in customary form, each DPSG Payoff Letter
shall (i) indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully satisfy all
principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs and any
other monetary obligations then due and payable (and not contingent or
unasserted) under each of the DPSG Credit Facilities as of the anticipated
Closing Date (and the daily accrual thereafter) (the " _DPSG Payoff Amount_
"), (ii) state that upon receipt of DPSG Payoff Amount under such Payoff
Letter, the DPSG Credit Facilities and all related loan documents shall be
terminated, as applicable and (iii) provide that all Liens and all guarantees
(if any) in connection therewith relating to the assets and properties of DPSG
or any of its Subsidiaries securing such obligations shall be, released and
terminated upon the payment of the DPSG Payoff Amount; provided that the
effectiveness of any such Payoff Letter shall be contingent upon the
occurrence of the Closing unless otherwise agreed by DPSG.

 



 

(i) If requested by Maple Parent, DPSG shall, to the extent permitted by the
applicable DPSG Existing Notes and the related indenture governing such DPSG
Existing Notes (the " _Indenture_ "), issue on the Closing Date a notice of
optional redemption for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of
any or all of the DPSG Existing Notes, pursuant to the redemption provisions
of the Indenture (the redemption of any or all series of DPSG Existing Notes,
the " _Redemption_ "); provided that DPSG shall not be obligated to issue a
notice of optional redemption pursuant to this _Section 7.08(i)_ until (i)
all of the conditions set forth in

 



      
 

 



 

Article VIII have been satisfied or waived by the applicable Persons and (ii)
the Closing will occur immediately following the delivery of such notice; and
provided further that in connection with the delivery of any such notice of
Redemption and consummation of the Redemption, DPSG shall deliver and shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause counsel for DPSG to deliver, customary
officers certificates and customary legal opinions, respectively, to the
trustee under each applicable Indenture, to the extent such certificates and
opinions are required thereby.

 



 

(j) On or prior to the Closing, Maple Parent shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause the agent under the Maple Credit Agreement to provide a copy of an
executed payoff letter (the " _Maple Parent Payoff Letter_ ") with respect to
the Maple Credit Agreement, in customary form, the Maple Parent Payoff Letter
shall (i) indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully satisfy all
principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs and any
other monetary obligations then due and payable (and not contingent or
unasserted) under the Maple Parent Payoff Letter as of the anticipated Closing
Date (and the daily accrual thereafter) (the " _Maple Parent Payoff Amount_
"), (ii) state that upon receipt of the Maple Parent Payoff Amount under such
Payoff Letter, the Maple Credit Agreement and all related loan documents shall
be terminated, as applicable and (iii) provide that all Liens and all
guarantees (if any) in connection therewith relating to the assets and
properties of the Maple Parent or any Maple Parent Subsidiary securing such
obligations shall be, released and terminated upon the payment of the Maple
Parent Payoff Amount.

 



 

Section 7.09 _Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) From the date hereof, DPSG
shall, to the fullest extent permissible by applicable Law, indemnify and hold
harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to
the Effective Time was, a director or officer of DPSG or of a DPSG Subsidiary
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") with respect to all claims,
liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including
amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and
expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any Legal Proceeding (whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on
or arising out of, in whole or in part, (i) the fact that an Indemnified Party
is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of DPSG or any DPSG
Subsidiary or (ii) acts or omissions by an Indemnified Party in the
Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of DPSG
or any DPSG Subsidiary or taken at the request of DPSG or any DPSG Subsidiary
(including in connection with serving at the request of DPSG or any DPSG
Subsidiary as a representative of another Person (including any employee
benefit plan)), in each case under clause (i) or (ii), at, or at any time
prior to, the Effective Time (including any Legal Proceeding relating in whole
or in part to the Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this
provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified
Party). Without limiting the foregoing, DPSG, from and for a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time, shall, unless otherwise required by Law, not
amend or modify its certificate of incorporation or bylaws to contain any
provisions that are less favorable to the Indemnified Parties or the employees
and agents of DPSG and the DPSG Subsidiaries with respect to limitation of
liabilities of directors, officers, employees and agents and indemnification
and advancement of expenses than are set forth as of the date of this
Agreement in the DPSG Charter, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnified Parties or the employees and agents of DPSG and
the DPSG Subsidiaries. In addition, from the date hereof, DPSG shall without
requiring a preliminary determination of entitlement to indemnification,
advance any

 



       
 

 



 

expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnified
Party incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with any Legal
Proceeding (including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations referred to in this _Section 7.09_) as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law.

 



 

(b) DPSG (whether prior to or after the Effective Time) shall not settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual
Legal Proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered under this _Section
7.09_ (each, a " _Claim_ ") for which indemnification could be sought by an
Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in
writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. DPSG and the Indemnified
Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall provide access
to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to
be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably
requested in connection therewith.

 



 

(c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
DPSG shall maintain in effect a directors and officers liability insurance
with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as DPSGs
insurance carrier as of the date hereof covering acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those individuals who are
currently (and any additional individuals who prior to the Effective Time
become) covered by DPSG directors and officers liability insurance policies
on terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as
favorable as DPSGs existing policies in effect on the date of this Agreement.
For the benefit of the Indemnified Parties, DPSG shall be permitted, prior to
the Effective Time, to obtain and fully pay the premium, subject to the
maximum annual premium referred to in the first proviso to this _Section
7.09(c)_, for the extension of (i) the directors and officers liability
coverage of DPSGs existing directors and officers insurance policies and
(ii) DPSGs existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for
a claims reporting or discovery period of six years from and after the
Effective Time that shall be from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as DPSGs insurance carrier as of the date hereof with respect
to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as DPSGs
existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or
the other Transactions). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, in no event shall Maple Parent or DPSG after the Effective Time be
required to expend for any policies contemplated by this clause (c) an annual
premium amount in excess of 350% of the annual premiums currently paid by DPSG
for such insurance; and, _provided_ , _further_ that if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, DPSG after the Effective Time
shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding such amount. If such prepaid DandO Insurance has been obtained by DPSG
prior to the Effective Time, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to
obtain insurance pursuant to this _Section 7.09(c)_ and DPSG shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such DandO Insurance to be maintained in full
force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all of its obligations
thereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.09_ will survive the Effective Time and
are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and (ii) in addition to, and not
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
such Indemnified Party may have under other contracts. After the Effective
Time, the obligations of DPSG under this _Section 7.09_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of
any Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 7.09_ applies unless (A) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (B) the affected
Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification.

 



 

(e) If DPSG (as the Surviving Corporation) after the Effective Time, Maple
Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision will be
made so that the successors and assigns of DPSG or Maple Parent, as
applicable, will assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.09_.

 



 

Section 7.10 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Maple Parent and DPSG shall each use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Merger to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, including (i) not taking
any action that such party knows would reasonably be expected to prevent such
qualification and (ii) considering and negotiating in good faith such
amendments to this Agreement as may be reasonably required in order to obtain
such qualification (it being understood that no party will be required to
agree to any such amendment). For federal income Tax purposes, each of DPSG,
Merger Sub and Maple Parent shall report the Merger and the other Transactions
in a manner consistent with such qualification.

 



 

(b) Prior to or at the Closing, Maple Parent shall deliver, or cause to be
delivered, to DPSG a properly executed affidavit, in a form reasonably
acceptable to DPSG, provided by Maple Parent pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3) certifying that (i) Maple Parent is not
and has not been a United States real property holding corporation during the
applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code, and (ii)
DPSG is not required to deduct or withhold any amounts under Section 1445 of
the Code from the Merger Consideration owing to the shareholders of Maple
Parent pursuant to this Agreement; and each shareholder of Maple Parent shall
deliver an IRS Form W-9 claiming a complete exemption from backup withholding
or an applicable IRS Form W-8.

 



 

(c) At least ten days prior to the Closing Date, Maple Parent shall provide to
DPSG in writing an estimate of its earnings and profits (computed under
federal income Tax principles) through the Closing Date, and for its taxable
year which includes the Closing Date which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
include any earnings and profits of Maple.

 



 

(d) At least ten days prior to the Closing Date, DPSG shall provide to Maple
Parent in writing an estimate of its earnings and profits (computed under
federal income

 



      
 

 



 

Tax principles) through the Closing Date, and for its taxable year which
includes the Closing Date.

 



 

(e) Prior to or at Closing, Maple Parent shall terminate all tax sharing,
allocation or similar agreements with and of its direct or indirect
shareholders and any other Person other than Maple Parent and its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) If Maple Parent receives the Change in Law Opinion from McDermott Will and
Emery LLP, it shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain a Tax-Free Opinion
from an alternative tax counsel of similar standing.

 



 

Section 7.11 _Section 16(a) Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, DPSG shall
take all such steps as may be required to cause (a) any dispositions of DPSG
Common Stock (including, in each case, derivative securities with respect
thereto) resulting from the Merger and the other Transactions by each
individual who will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to DPSG immediately prior to the Effective
Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (b)
any acquisitions of DPSG Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to DPSG Common Stock) resulting from the Merger and the other
Transactions, by each individual who may become subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to DPSG, to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 7.12 _Governance Matters_. DPSG shall take all necessary action to
cause, including procuring any necessary resignations of directors, effective
at the Effective Time, (a) the DPSG Board to be comprised of twelve (12)
directors and (b) the DPSG Board to be comprised of (i) eight (8) directors
identified by Maple Parent, (ii) two (2) directors identified by DPSG
(collectively, the " _Continuing Directors_ ") and (iii) two (2) directors
mutually agreed upon by Maple Parent and DPSG who shall be "independent" under
NYSE Listed Company Manual Rule 303A.02 and Rule 10A-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act. From and after the Effective Time, until the earlier of the day
immediately prior to the second annual meeting of stockholders of the
Surviving Corporation following the Closing or such time as a Continuing
Director informs DPSG in writing that he or she no longer wishes to serve as a
Continuing Director (in each such case, a " _Continuing Director Resignation_
"), (A) DPSG shall cause each Continuing Director to be included in
managements slate of nominees for the election of directors of DPSG at each
meeting of DPSG stockholders at which directors are to be elected and (B)
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the election of each applicable
Continuing Director to the DPSG Board at each such meeting, including by
recommending that the DPSG stockholders vote in favor of the election of each
such Continuing Director, soliciting proxies in respect thereof and otherwise
supporting each such Continuing Director for election in a manner no less
rigorous and favorable than the manner in which DPSG supports its other
nominees. From and after the receipt of a Continuing Director Resignation, the
obligations in subsections (A) and (B) of the immediately preceding sentence
will continue; _provided_ that, the reference in the immediately preceding
sentence to the Continuing Director who has delivered such Continuing Director
Resignation (or both Continuing Directors to the extent both Continuing
Directors have delivered a Continuing Director Resignation) shall be a
reference to an Independent Director selected by the members of the DPSG Board
who are Independent Directors. For purposes of this Agreement, an "Independent
Director" is a Person (x) who

 



      
 

 



 

qualifies as an "Independent Director" as defined in the NYSE Listed Company
Manual or who qualifies as "independent" under the applicable rules and
regulations of any other national securities exchange on which the Equity
Interests of DPSG are publicly traded after the date hereof, and (y) is not an
Affiliate of, employed by, or otherwise lacking in independence from, JAB,
Mondelēz or any of their respective Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, in
no event, following the Effective Time, will the DPSG Board be comprised of
less than two members who are either Continuing Directors or Independent
Directors. In no event shall DPSG, prior to June 18, 2018, call, give notice
of, convene or hold, an annual meeting of its stockholders for purposes of
electing directors or any other business other than the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (but for the avoidance of doubt, the election
of directors and other business may be among the proposals at the DPSG
Stockholders Meeting).

 



 

Section 7.13 _Special Dividend_.

 



 

(a) Maple Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish promptly to
DPSG (or, if requested by DPSG, directly to the Solvency Advisor) all

with the Solvency Advisors or the DPSG Boards consideration of the Special
Dividend. All information provided pursuant to this Section 7.13 shall be

least equal to $9,000,000,000, payable immediately following the record date
thereof to holders of record of the issued and outstanding shares of Maple
Parent capital stock as of immediately following the Effective Time (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall be solely DPSG as the sole holder of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation)) and (ii) provide the resolutions
declaring such dividend to DPSG (the " _Maple Parent Dividend Resolutions_ ").

 



 

(c) Subject to receipt of (i) the Solvency Opinion from the Solvency Advisor,
(ii) the Maple Parent Dividend Resolutions from Maple Parent and (iii) a
certificate (the " _Maple Parent Financing Certificate_ ") from Maple Parent
(which certificate may not be provided earlier than three Business Days, or
later than two Business Days, prior to the Closing Date) that (A) the
conditions to the Debt Financing have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) and, to
the Knowledge of Maple Parent, the Debt Financing will be funded at the
Closing and (B) assuming the financing of the Debt Financing and that the
Closing were held on the date such certificate were provided, the aggregate
proceeds from the Debt Financing will be sufficient in amount, together with
other financial resources of Maple Parent and the Maple Parent Subsidiaries,
for Maple Parent or the applicable payor to make (or cause the making of) the
payment of the Required Amount, the DPSG Board shall declare, in accordance
with applicable Law, a special cash dividend (the " _Special Dividend_ "), in
an amount per share of DPSG Common Stock (the " _Special Dividend Per Share
Amount_ ") equal to one hundred and three dollars and seventy five cents
($103.75), subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section 3.01(c)_,
payable on the date that is one Business Days after the Effective Time to
holders of record of the issued and outstanding shares of DPSG Common Stock as
of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing
Date (the " _Dividend Record Time_ " and such holders of record, the "
_Dividend Stockholders_ "), which Special Dividend will be made conditioned
upon the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, DPSG shall
designate Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to act as
the paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment of the Special Dividend
to the Dividend Stockholders. The agreement pursuant to which DPSG shall
appoint the Paying Agent shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Maple Parent. Immediately following the Effective Time, DPSG shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the product
of the Special Dividend Per Share Amount multiplied by the number of shares of
DPSG Common Stock entitled to receive the Special Dividend.

 



 

Section 7.14 _Investor Rights Agreements_. At the Effective Time, DPSG and
each other party identified in _Exhibit D_, shall execute and deliver an
Investor Rights Agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as

principles set forth in _Section 7.15_ of the Maple Parent Disclosure Letter.
Maple Parent shall keep DPSG reasonably informed in respect of the actions and
timing of the Maple Parent.

 



 

Section 7.16 _Director Powers_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, following the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a majority
of the Continuing Directors (or if no Continuing Directors exist, the
Independent Directors) shall be required for DPSG to amend, modify or waive
Section 7.12, Section 7.13 or this Section 7.16, or take any action in
connection with the Special Dividend (including to make any determination or
give any approval or authorization that is required to be taken or given by
the DPSG Board in connection therewith). The Continuing Directors (or if no
Continuing Directors exist, the Independent Directors) shall have the
authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to DPSG or
counsel that is selected solely by the Continuing Directors (or if no
Continuing Directors exist, the Independent Directors)) and other advisors at
the expense of DPSG as shall be determined by the Continuing Directors (or if
no Continuing Directors exist, the Independent Directors), and the authority
(acting as a committee of the DPSG Board, which shall be deemed to have been
duly constituted by the DPSG Boards approval of this Agreement) to institute
any action on behalf of DPSG or the Dividend Stockholders to enforce
obligations arising under or in connection with this Agreement.

Fee within two Business Days of consummation of such Acquisition Event;

 



 

(ii) by DPSG pursuant to _Section 9.01(h)_, then DPSG shall pay to Maple
Parent the Termination Fee prior to or concurrently with such termination; or

 



 

(iii) by Maple Parent pursuant to _Section 9.01(g)_, then DPSG shall pay to

event any such payment becomes due and payable and is paid, and, upon payment
of the Termination Fee or Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, DPSG or
Maple Parent, as applicable (and DPSGs or Maple Parents, as applicable,
Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees,
stockholders and Representatives) shall have no further liability to Maple
Parent or DPSG, as applicable, under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that DPSG or Maple Parent, as applicable, shall not be relieved or released
from any liabilities or damages arising out of its Willful Breach of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the aggregate amount of any damages
determined by a court to be payable by DPSG or Maple Parent, as applicable,
pursuant to the foregoing proviso shall be reduced by the amount of any
Termination Fee previously paid to Maple Parent or Reverse Termination Fee
previously paid to DPSG, as applicable, pursuant to this _Section 9.02(b)_.

 



 

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in _Section
9.02(b)_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if
DPSG fails to promptly pay the Termination Fee or Maple Parent fails to pay
the Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Maple Parent, or DPSG, as applicable, commences a suit that results
in a Judgment against DPSG for the Termination Fee (or a portion thereof) or
Maple Parent for the Reverse Termination Fee (or a portion thereof), as
applicable, DPSG or Maple Parent, as

 



      
 

 



 

applicable, shall pay Maple Parent or DPSG, as applicable, its costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together

payment was required to be made. All payments under _Section 9.02(b)_ shall
be made promptly by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the party receiving such payment.

DPSG Stockholder Approval has been obtained or the Merger Sub Stockholder

approval by the stockholders of DPSG, Maple Parent or Merger Sub shall be
effective only with the approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not

parties; _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, this _Section 9.03_, _Section 10.08_, _Section 10.10(b)_, _Section
10.10(c)_, _Section 10.11_ and _Section 10.14(b)_ (and any related

not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is materially adverse
to the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the parties to
the Debt Commitment Letter (not including Maple Parent), which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

Section 9.04 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
Maple Parent and DPSG (on behalf of itself and Merger Sub) may, to the extent

signed by an authorized officer on behalf of such party, but such extension or
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition will not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

Section 10.04 _Interpretation; Construction_. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to an Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or
Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents,
index of defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only, do not constitute part of this Agreement, and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Any
capitalized term used in any Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall
have the meaning assigned to such term in this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or

 



      
 

 



 

"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby,"
"herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. The words "date hereof" when used in this
Agreement shall refer to the date of this Agreement. The word "will" shall be
construed to have the same meaning as "shall". The words "made available to
DPSG" and words of similar import refer to documents and other information
posted to the Intralinks virtual data room by or on behalf of Maple Parent or
delivered in person or electronically to DPSG or its Representatives. The
words "made available to Maple Parent" and words of similar import refer to
documents and other information posted to the Merrill Datasite virtual data
room by or on behalf of DPSG or delivered in person or electronically to Maple
Parent or its Representatives. Unless the context requires otherwise, the word
"material" shall be construed in light of DPSG and the DPSG Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or Maple Parent and the Maple Parent Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, as the case may be. The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent"
in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or
other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if." The
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well
as the plural forms of such terms. Any agreement, instrument or Law defined or
referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or Law as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented, unless otherwise specifically
indicated. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and
assigns. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all references to "dollars"
and "$" will be deemed references to the lawful money of the United States of
America. No provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in favor of, or
against, any of the parties to this Agreement by reason of the extent to which
any such party or its legal counsel participated in the drafting thereof or by
reason of the extent to which any such provision is inconsistent with any
prior draft of this Agreement, and no rule of strict construction will be
applied against any party hereto. The Maple Parent Disclosure Letter and the
DPSG Disclosure Letter set forth items of disclosure with specific reference
to the particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the
information in the Maple Parent Disclosure Letter or DPSG Disclosure Letter,
as the case may be, relates; _provided_ that any fact or item that is
disclosed in any section of the Maple Parent Disclosure Letter or the DPSG
Disclosure Letter so as to make its relevance (a) to other representations
made elsewhere in the Agreement, (b) to the information called for by other
sections of the Maple Parent Disclosure Letter or the DPSG Disclosure Letter
or (c) to the annexes or exhibits to this Agreement reasonably apparent shall
be deemed to qualify such representations or to be disclosed in such other
sections of the Maple Parent Disclosure Letter, the DPSG Disclosure Letter or
the annexes or exhibits to this Agreement, as the case may be, notwithstanding
the omission of any appropriate cross-reference thereto; _provided_ ,
_further_ that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the inclusion of an item in either such disclosure schedule as an exception to
a representation or warranty will not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Maple Parent
Material Adverse Effect or a DPSG Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.
The exception for disclosures in the DPSG SEC Reports shall only apply to such
disclosures in the DPSG SEC Reports that are reasonably specific as to their
subject matter and reasonably apparent on their face to be applicable to one
or more representations and warranties set forth herein (and then only to such
representations and warranties). Except where the context otherwise requires,
references to the "other party" or "either party" will be deemed to refer to
Maple Parent, on the

 



      
 

 



 

one hand, and DPSG and Merger Sub, collectively, on the other hand. All
electronic communications from a Person shall be deemed to be "written" for
purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.05 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be
invalid, void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of
this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity
declares that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, void or
unenforceable, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are
fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 10.06 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered (by electronic communication, facsimile or otherwise) to
the other parties.

 



 

Section 10.07 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits
hereto), the DPSG Disclosure Letter, the Maple Parent Disclosure Letter and
the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties,
both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter
hereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF MAPLE PARENT, MERGER SUB NOR
DPSG MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS
TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE BY, OR MADE
AVAILABLE BY, ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY OF SUCH PARTYS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH
RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE
DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY
DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE
FOREGOING.

 



 

Section 10.08 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section
7.09_ (Indemnification Insurance) and in _Section 7.08(c)_ (Debt Matters -
Indemnification), Maple Parent and DPSG hereby agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms
of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer
upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties
set forth herein; provided, however, that the Financing Sources are hereby
made express third-party beneficiaries of _Section 9.03_, this _Section
10.08_, _Section 10.10(b)_, _Section 10.10(c)_, _Section 10.11_ and
_Section 10.14(b)_. The

 



      
 

 



 

representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 9.04_
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the Knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 



 

Section 10.09 _Obligations of Maple Parent and of DPSG_. Whenever this
Agreement requires Merger Sub or another Subsidiary of DPSG to take any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part
of DPSG to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and after the Effective
Time, DPSG shall be liable for any failure of such Person. Whenever this
Agreement requires any Subsidiary of Maple Parent to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Maple
Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective
Time, on the part of DPSG to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES, WHETHER OF
THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. Each of the parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits, for itself and with
respect to its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware and the appropriate respective appellate
courts therefrom (or only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
declines to accept or does not have jurisdiction over a particular matter, any
federal or other state court located in the State of Delaware and the
appropriate respective appellate courts therefrom) solely in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the
documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the Transactions,
and hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit
or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such
document, that it is not subject to jurisdiction thereto or that such action,
suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or
that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any
such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto
irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding
shall be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines
to accept or does not have jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal
or other state court located in the State of Delaware). The parties hereby
consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such
parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such
dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with
any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 10.02_ or in
such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient
service thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties agrees that it will
not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim, or
third-party claim of any kind or description (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise), against any Financing Source in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to any financing commitment or the
Equity Financing or the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, Borough of Manhattan or, if under applicable Law, exclusive jurisdiction
is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York in the County of New York (and appellate courts
thereof)

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
AND THEREBY OR TO THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF (INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION, IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEBT FINANCING CONTEMPLATED BY THE DEBT
COMMITMENT LETTER). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS Section 10.10.

 



 

Section 10.11 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, Maple Parent (and, following the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation) may, without the consent of any party hereto, assign, in whole or
in part, its rights under this Agreement to any of the Financing Sources as
collateral security. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be
void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

Section 10.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy therefor and therefore fully intend for specific
performance to be an available remedy for breaches of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.01_, the parties shall be entitled to an Injunction or
Injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
referred to in _Section 10.10(a)_, without proof of actual damages, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in
equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to object to a remedy of specific performance on the basis that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach. Each party further acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this _Section 10.12_ are an integral part of the Merger and the
other Transactions and that, without these agreements, it and the other
parties would not enter into this Agreement. Each party further agrees that no
other party hereto or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or
post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 10.12_, and each party
hereto irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 



 

Section 10.13 _Publicity_. The parties agree that the initial press release to
be issued with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions shall be a
joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by Maple Parent and DPSG.
Except (a) with respect to any Change of Recommendation made in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and (b) with respect to disclosures that are
consistent with prior disclosures made in compliance with this _Section
10.13_ or any communications plan or strategy previously agreed on by the
parties, Maple Parent and DPSG shall consult with each other before issuing,
and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the Merger or the other
Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may
reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange.

 



 

Section 10.14 _Non-Recourse_.

 



 

(a) No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, stockholder, agent, attorney, representative or affiliate of
any party hereto or of any of their respective Affiliates (unless such
Affiliate is expressly a party to this Agreement) shall have any liability
(whether in contract or in tort) for any obligations or liabilities of such
party arising under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Transactions;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 10.14 shall limit any
liability of the parties to this Agreement for breaches of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, DPSG agrees on
behalf of itself and the DPSG Subsidiaries and its Affiliates that (i) prior
to the Effective Time, none of the Financing Sources shall have any liability
or obligation to DPSG, the DPSG Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates relating to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt
Financing, any alternate debt financing or any of the transactions
contemplated herein and (ii) prior to the Effective Time, it will not (A) seek
to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this
Agreement against, or seek to recover

 



      
 

 



 

monetary damages from, any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement
or (B) seek to directly enforce the commitments against, make any claims for
breach of the Debt Commitment Letter against, or seek to recover monetary
damages from, or otherwise sue, any Financing Source for any reason in
connection therewith. DPSG, each DPSG Subsidiary and its Affiliates hereby
waive any and all claims and causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Financing Sources that may be
based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment
Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. This _Section
10.14(b)_ is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Financing Sources
and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of DPSG. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 10.14(b)_ shall limit the liability
or obligations of the Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment Letter or
the documents governing any existing credit facilities provided by any
Financing Source to Maple Parent or to DPSG or any DPSG Subsidiary after the
Effective Time.

 



 

Section 10.15 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions will be paid by the party
incurring such costs and expenses.

2. _Demand Registration._

 



 

(a) _Demand by Holders_.

 



 

(i) If, at any time beginning 90 days prior to the expiration of the
Standstill Period, the Company does not otherwise have an effective
registration statement on Form S-3 covering a Holders Registrable Securities
on file with the SEC and the Company shall have received a request, subject to
_Section 16_, from any Qualified Shareholder (the " _Requesting Shareholder_
") that the Company effect the registration under the Securities Act of all or
any portion of such Requesting Shareholders Registrable Securities (x) on
Form S-1 or any similar long-form Registration Statement (a " _Long-Form
Registration_") or (y) on Form S-3 or any similar short-form Registration
Statement, which shall include a prospectus supplement to an existing Form S-3
(a " _Short-Form Registration_") if the Company qualifies to use such short
form Registration Statement (any such requested Long-Form Registration or
Short-Form Registration, a " _Demand Registration_ "), and specifying the kind
and aggregate amount of Registrable Securities to be registered and the
intended method of disposition thereof, then the Company shall promptly, but
in no event later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the effective date of
the Registration Statement relating to such Demand Registration, give notice
of such request (a " _Demand Notice_ ") to the other Holders, specifying the
number of Registrable Securities for which the Requesting Shareholder has
requested registration under this _Section 2(a)_. During the ten (10)
Business Days after receipt of a Demand Notice, all Holders (other than the
Requesting Shareholder) may provide a written request to the Company,
specifying the aggregate amount of Registrable Securities held by such Holders
requested to be registered as part of such Demand Registration and the
intended method of distribution thereof; _provided_ that, if, on the date of
any request by a Qualified Shareholder, the Company qualifies as a well-known
seasoned issuer as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) eligible to
file an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to
_Section 3_ of this Agreement, the provisions of this _Section 2_ shall not
apply, and the provisions of _Section 3_ shall apply instead.

 



 

(ii) The Company shall file such Registration Statement with the SEC within
ninety (90) days of such request, in the case of a Long-Form Registration, and
thirty (30) days of such request, in the case of a Short-Form Registration;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company be obligated to
file such Registration Statement prior to the first Business Day after

 



      
 

 



 

the expiration of the Standstill Period, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective under
the Securities Act and the "blue sky" Laws of such jurisdictions as any
Participating Shareholder or any underwriter, if any, reasonably requests, as
expeditiously as possible, all to the extent necessary to permit the
disposition (in accordance with the intended methods thereof) of the
Registrable Securities so to be registered.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 2(a)_, (A)
the Company shall not be obligated to effect more than two (2) Long-Form
Registrations over any three (3) year period at the request of any Holder, (B)
from and after the time the Company becomes eligible for a Short-Form
Registration, the Holders shall be entitled to effect three (3) Short-Form
Registrations per calendar year in the aggregate in addition to the Long-Form
Registrations to which they are entitled (which Long-Form Registrations, at
the election of the Requesting Shareholder, may be effected as Short-Form
Registrations, in which case they will count as Long-Form Registrations for
purposes of the preceding clause (A)) and (C) the Company shall not be
obligated to effect a Demand Registration unless the aggregate proceeds
expected to be received from the sale of the Registrable Securities requested
to be included in such Demand Registration equals or exceeds five hundred
million dollars ($500,000,000) if pursuant to a Long-Form Registration, or
three hundred million dollars ($300,000,000) if pursuant to a Short-Form
Registration.

 



 

(b) _Demand Withdrawal_. A Participating Shareholder may withdraw its
Registrable Securities from a Demand Registration at any time prior to the
effectiveness of the applicable Registration Statement. Upon receipt of a
notice from all of the Participating Shareholders to such effect, the Company
shall cease all efforts to secure effectiveness of the applicable Registration
Statement, and such registration shall nonetheless be deemed a Demand
Registration for purposes of _Section 2(a)_ unless (i) the withdrawing
Participating Shareholders shall have paid or reimbursed the Company for their
pro rata share of all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and
expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the registration of the
withdrawing Participating Shareholders withdrawn Registrable Securities
(based on the number of Registrable Securities such withdrawing Participating
Shareholders sought to register, as compared to the total number of Company
Securities included on such Registration Statement), (ii) the withdrawal is
made following the occurrence of a Material Adverse Change, because the
registration would require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure or
because the Company otherwise requests withdrawal or (iii) the withdrawal
arose out of the fault of the Company (in each such case the Company shall be
obligated to pay all Registration Expenses in connection with such revoked
request except to the extent otherwise paid pursuant to clause (i)).

 



 

(c) _Company Notifications_. Within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt
by the Participating Shareholders of the Demand Notice, the Company will
notify all Participating Shareholders of the identities of the other
Participating Shareholders and the number of Registrable Securities requested
to be included therein.

 



 

(d) _Registration Expenses_. The Company shall be liable for and pay all
Registration Expenses in connection with any Demand Registration, regardless
of whether such registration is effected, subject to reimbursement pursuant to
_Section 2(b)(i)_, if applicable.

 



       
 

 



 

(e) _Effective Registration_. A Demand Registration shall be deemed to have
occurred if the Registration Statement relating thereto (i) has become
effective under the Securities Act and (ii) has remained effective for a
period of at least 180 calendar days (or such shorter period in which all
Registrable Securities of the Participating Shareholders included in such
registration have actually been sold thereunder or withdrawn) or, if such
Registration Statement relates to an Underwritten Offering, such longer period
as, in the opinion of counsel for the underwriter or underwriters, a
prospectus is required by Law to be delivered in connection with sales of
Registrable Securities by an underwriter or dealer (the applicable period, the
" _Demand Period_ "); _provided_ , that a Demand Registration shall not be
deemed to have occurred if, (A) during the Demand Period, such Registration
Statement is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or
requirement of the SEC or other Governmental Entity or court, (B) the
conditions to closing specified in the underwriting agreement, if any, entered
into in connection with such registration are not satisfied other than by
reason of a wrongful act, misrepresentation or breach of such applicable
underwriting agreement by any Participating Shareholder or (C) the Maximum
Offering Size (as defined below) is reduced in accordance with _Section 2(g)_
such that less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the Registrable Securities
that the Requesting Shareholder sought to be included in such registration are
included.

 



 

(f) _Underwritten Offerings_. If any Participating Shareholder that is a
Qualified Shareholder so requests, an offering of Registrable Securities
pursuant to a Demand Registration shall be in the form of an Underwritten
Offering.

 



 

(g) _Priority of Securities Registered Pursuant to Demand Registrations_. If
the managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Offering
advise the Board (or, in the case of a Demand Registration not being
underwritten, the Board determines in its reasonable discretion) that, in its
view, the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
registration (including any securities that the Company proposes to be
included that are not Registrable Securities) exceeds the largest number of
shares that can be sold without being likely to have an adverse effect on the
price, timing or distribution of the shares offered in such offering (the "
_Maximum Offering Size_ "), the Company shall include in such registration, in
the priority listed below, up to the Maximum Offering Size:

 



 

(i) (1) if the Requesting Shareholder is JAB, _first_ , all Registrable
Securities requested to be registered by JAB and all other Participating
Shareholders (allocated, if necessary for the offering not to exceed the
Maximum Offering Size, pro rata among JAB and such other Participating
Shareholders on the basis of the relative number of Registrable Securities
owned by JAB and the other Participating Shareholders; _provided_ , that any
securities thereby allocated to JAB or another Participating Shareholder that
exceed such Holders request shall be reallocated among the remaining
Participating Shareholders in like manner), or

 



 

(2) if the Requesting Shareholder is MDLZ, (A) _first_ , all Registrable
Securities requested to be included in such registration by MDLZ, and (B)
_second_ , and only if all the securities referred to in clause 2(A) have been
included, all Registrable Securities requested to be registered by the other
Participating Shareholders (allocated, if necessary for the offering not to
exceed the Maximum Offering Size, pro rata among such Participating
Shareholders on the basis of the relative number of Registrable Securities
owned by the Participating

 



      
 

 



 

Shareholders; _provided_ , that any securities thereby allocated to a
Participating Shareholder that exceed such Participating Shareholders request
shall be reallocated among the remaining Participating Shareholders in like
manner), and

 



 

(ii) thereafter, and only if all the securities referred to in clause (i)(1)
or (2), as applicable, have been included, any securities proposed to be
registered by the Company or any securities proposed to be registered for the
account of any other Persons (including the Company), with such priorities
among them as the Company shall determine.

 



 

(h) _Delay in Filing; Suspension of Registration_. If, upon the determination
of a majority of the disinterested members of the Board, the filing, initial
effectiveness or continued use of a Registration Statement in respect of a
Demand Registration at any time would require the Company to make an Adverse
Disclosure, the Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such action
to the Participating Shareholders, delay the filing or initial effectiveness
of, or suspend use of, such Registration Statement (a " _Demand Suspension_
"); _provided_ , that (x) the Company shall not be permitted to exercise a
Demand Suspension (i) more than three (3) times during any 12-month period or
(ii) for more than one hundred (100) days in aggregate during any 12-month
period and (y) such Demand Suspension shall terminate at such time as the
Company would no longer be required to make any Adverse Disclosure; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that in the event of a Demand Suspension, if a
Participating Shareholder has not sold any Company Securities under such
Registration Statement, it shall be entitled to withdraw Registrable
Securities from such Demand Registration and, if all Participating
Shareholders so withdraw, such Demand Registration shall not be counted for
purposes of the limit on Long-Form Registrations requested by such
Participating Shareholders in _Section 2(a)_. In the case of a Demand
Suspension, the Participating Shareholders agree to suspend use of the
applicable prospectus and any issuer free writing prospectuses in connection
with any sale or purchase of, or offer to sell or purchase, Registrable
Securities, upon receipt of the notice referred to above. The Company shall
immediately notify the Participating Shareholders upon the termination of any
Demand Suspension, amend or supplement the prospectus and any issuer free
writing prospectus, if necessary, so it does not contain any untrue statement
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading and furnish to the Participating
Shareholders such numbers of copies of the prospectus and any issuer free
writing prospectus as so amended or supplemented as the Participating
Shareholders may reasonably request. The Company agrees, if necessary, to
supplement or make amendments to the applicable Registration Statement if
required by the registration form used by the Company for the applicable
Demand Registration or by the instructions applicable to such registration
form or by the Securities Act or the rules or regulations promulgated
thereunder, or as may reasonably be requested by the Participating
Shareholder. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company shall not be permitted to file a registration statement to register
for sale, or to conduct any registered securities offerings (including any
"take-downs" off of an effective shelf registration statement) of, any of its
securities either for its own account or the account of any security holder or
holders during any Demand Suspension.

 



      
 

 



 

3. _Shelf Registration_.

 



 

(a) _Filing_. If, at any time beginning 90 days prior to the expiration of the
Standstill Period, the Company shall have received a request, subject to

for the filing of a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this _Section
3_, and at such time the Company is eligible to file a registration statement
on Form S-3, the Company shall, within sixty (60) days of such Shelf Offering
Request, but in no event prior to the first Business Day after the expiration
of the Standstill Period, file with the SEC a Shelf Registration Statement

such Holders and set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement and, as
promptly as practicable thereafter, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective
under the Securities Act (or if the Company qualifies to do so, it shall file
an automatic Shelf Registration Statement in response to any such request).
If, on the date of any such Shelf Offering Request, the Company does not
qualify to file a Shelf Registration Statement under the Securities Act, the
provisions of this _Section 3_ shall not apply, and the provisions of
_Section 2_ shall apply instead.

 



 

(b) _Continued Effectiveness_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective under
the Securities Act (including, if necessary, by renewing or refiling a Shelf
Registration Statement prior to expiration of the existing Shelf Registration
Statement or by filing with the SEC a post-effective amendment or a supplement
to the Shelf Registration Statement or any document incorporated therein by
reference or by filing any other required document or otherwise supplementing
or amending the Shelf Registration Statement, if required by the rules,
regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the
Company for such Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, any state securities or blue sky Laws, or any rules and
regulations thereunder) in order to permit the prospectus forming a part
thereof to be usable by Holders until the earlier of (i) the date as of which
all Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration
Statement or another Registration Statement filed under the Securities Act
(but in no event prior to the applicable period referred to in Section 4(a)(3)
of the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder) and (ii) the date as of which
each of the Holders is permitted to sell its Registrable Securities without
Registration pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act without volume
limitation or other restrictions on transfer thereunder (such period of
effectiveness, the " _Shelf Period_ "). Subject to _Section 3(d)_, the
Company shall not be deemed to have used its reasonable best efforts to keep
the Shelf Registration Statement effective during the Shelf Period if the
Company voluntarily takes any action or omits to take any action that would
result in Holders of Registrable Securities covered thereby not being able to
offer and sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration
Statement during the Shelf Period, unless such action or omission is required
by applicable Law or is in connection with a Shelf Suspension.

 



 

(c) _Shelf Notice_. Promptly upon receipt of any request to file a Shelf
Registration Statement pursuant to _Section 3(a)_ (but in no event more than
five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Company shall deliver a written notice
of any such request to all other Holders.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Suspension of Registration_. If, upon the determination of a majority of
the disinterested members of the Board, the continued use of such Shelf
Registration Statement at any time would require the Company to make an
Adverse Disclosure, the Company may, upon giving at least 10 calendar days
prior written notice of such action to the Holders, suspend use of the Shelf
Registration Statement (a " _Shelf Suspension_ "); _provided_ , that (x) the
Company shall not be permitted to exercise a Shelf Suspension (i) more than
three (3) times during any 12-month period, or (ii) for more than one hundred
(100) days in aggregate during any 12-month period and (y) such Shelf
Registration shall terminate at such time as the Company would no longer be
required to make any Adverse Disclosure. In the case of a Shelf Suspension,
the Holders agree to suspend use of the applicable prospectus and any issuer
free writing prospectus in connection with any sale or purchase of, or offer
to sell or purchase, Registrable Securities, upon receipt of the notice
referred to above. The Company shall immediately notify the Holders upon the
termination of any Shelf Suspension, amend or supplement the prospectus and
any issuer free writing prospectus, if necessary, so it does not contain any
untrue statement or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and furnish
to the Holders such numbers of copies of the prospectus and any issuer free
writing prospectus as so amended or supplemented as the Holders may reasonably
request. The Company agrees, if necessary, to supplement or make amendments to
the Shelf Registration Statement, if required by the registration form used by
the Company for the Shelf Registration or by the instructions applicable to
such registration form or by the Securities Act or the rules or regulations
promulgated thereunder or as may reasonably be requested by the Holders.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall
not be permitted to file a registration statement to register for sale, or to
conduct any registered securities offerings (including any "take-downs" off of
an effective shelf registration statement) of, any of its securities either
for its own account or the account of any security holder or holders during
any Shelf Suspension.

 



 

(e) _Underwritten Shelf Takedown_.

 



 

(i) For any offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement for which the value of Registrable Securities proposed
to be offered is at least three hundred million dollars ($300,000,000), if any
Participating Shareholder that is a Qualified Shareholder so elects, such
offering shall be in the form of an Underwritten Offering, and the Company
shall amend or supplement the Shelf Registration Statement for such purpose.
Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time during which the
Shelf Registration Statement is in effect a Participating Shareholder elects
to offer Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement
in the form of an Underwritten Offering, then such Participating Shareholder
shall give written notice (which notice may be given by email) to the Company
of such intention at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date on which
such Underwritten Offering is anticipated to launch, specifying the number of
Registrable Securities for which the Participating Shareholder is requesting
registration under this _Section 3(e)_ and the other material terms of such
Underwritten Offering to the extent known (such request, an " _Underwritten
Shelf Takedown Request_ ," and any Underwritten Offering conducted pursuant
thereto, an " _Underwritten Shelf Takedown_ "), and the Company shall
promptly, but in no event later than the Business Day following the receipt of
such Underwritten Shelf Takedown Request, give written notice (which notice
may be given by email to the email address for each other

 



      
 

 



 

Holder on file with the Company from time to time) of such Underwritten Shelf
Takedown Request (such notice, an " _Underwritten Shelf Takedown Notice_ ") to
the other Holders and such Underwritten Shelf Takedown Notice shall offer the
other Holders the opportunity to register as part of such Underwritten Shelf
Takedown such number of Registrable Securities as each such other Holder may
request in writing (which request may be made by email to the Company).
Subject to _Section 3(e)(ii)_ and _Section 3(e)(iii)_, the Company and the
Participating Shareholder(s) making the Underwritten Shelf Takedown Request
shall cause the underwriter(s) to include as part of the Underwritten Shelf
Takedown all Registrable Securities that are requested to be included therein
by any of the other Holders within twenty-four (24) hours after the receipt by
such other Holders of any such notice, all to the extent necessary to permit
the disposition of the Registrable Securities to be so sold; _provided_ , that
all such other Holders requesting to participate in the Underwritten Shelf
Takedown must sell their Registrable Securities to the underwriters selected
on the same terms and conditions as apply to the Participating Shareholder(s)
requesting the Underwritten Shelf Takedown; _provided_ , _further_ , that, if
at any time after making an Underwritten Shelf Takedown Request and prior to
the launch of the Underwritten Shelf Takedown, the Participating
Shareholder(s) requesting the Underwritten Shelf Takedown shall determine for
any reason not to proceed with or to delay such Underwritten Shelf Takedown,
the Participating Shareholder(s) shall give written notice to the Company of
such determination and the Company shall give written notice of the same to
each other Holder and, thereupon, (A) in the case of a determination not to
proceed, the Company and such Participating Shareholder(s) shall be relieved
of their respective obligations to cause the underwriter(s) to include any
Registrable Securities of the other Holders as part of such Underwritten Shelf
Takedown (but the Company shall not be relieved from its obligation to pay the
Registration Expenses in connection therewith), without prejudice, however, to
the other registration rights contained herein, and (B) in the case of a
determination to delay such Underwritten Shelf Takedown, the Company and such
Participating Shareholder(s) shall be relieved of their respective obligations
to cause the underwriter(s) to include any Registrable Securities of the other
Holders as part of such Underwritten Shelf Takedown for the same period as the
Participating Shareholder(s) determine(s) to delay such Underwritten Shelf
Takedown.

 



 

(ii) If the managing underwriter of an Underwritten Shelf Takedown advises the
Company or the Participating Shareholder(s) requesting the Underwritten Shelf
Takedown that, in its view, the number of Company Shares that the
Participating Shareholder(s) and such other Holders intend to include in such
registration exceeds the Maximum Offering Size, the Company and the
Participating Shareholder(s) making the Underwritten Shelf Takedown Request
shall cause the underwriter(s) to include in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown,
in the following priority, up to the Maximum Offering Size:

 



 

(A) (1) if the Participating Shareholder requesting the Underwritten Shelf
Takedown is JAB, _first_ to JAB and all other Holders who requested to include
Registrable Securities in such registration pursuant to _Section 3(e)(i)_
(allocated, if necessary for the offering not to exceed the Maximum Offering
Size, pro rata among JAB and such other Holders on the basis of the relative
number of Registrable Securities owned by JAB and such other Holders;
_provided_ , that any securities thereby allocated to a Holder that exceed
such Holders request shall be reallocated among the remaining Holders in like
manner), or

 



      
 

 



 

(2) if the Participating Shareholder requesting the Underwritten Shelf
Takedown is MDLZ, (x) _first_ , all Registrable Securities requested to be
included in such registration by MDLZ, and (y) second, and only if all of the
securities referred to in clause 2(x) have been included, all Registrable
Securities requested to be included in such registration by any other Holders
pursuant to _Section 3(e)(i)_ (allocated, if necessary for the offering not
to exceed the Maximum Offering Size, pro rata among such Holders on the basis
of the relative number of Registrable Securities owned by such Holders;
_provided_ , that any securities thereby allocated to a Holder that exceed
such Holders request shall be reallocated among the remaining Holders in like
manner), and

 



 

(B) thereafter, and only if all of the securities referred to in clause (A)(1)
or (2), as applicable, have been included, any securities proposed to be
registered for the account of the Company any other Persons with such
priorities among them as the Participating Shareholder(s) requesting the
Underwritten Shelf Takedown shall determine.

 



 

(iii) Each Holder shall be permitted to withdraw all or part of its
Registrable Securities from an Underwritten Shelf Takedown at any time prior
to 7:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date on which the Underwritten Shelf
Takedown is anticipated to launch.

 



 

(f) _Payment of Expenses for Shelf Registrations_. The Company shall be liable
for and pay all Registration Expenses in connection with any Shelf
Registration, regardless of whether such registration is effected.

 



 

4. _Piggyback Registration_.

 



 

(a) _Participation_. If, following the expiration of the Standstill Period,
the Company at any time proposes to sell in an underwritten Public Offering
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, a "take-down" pursuant to a prospectus
supplement to an effective shelf registration statement) or file a
Registration Statement with respect to any offering of its Common Stock for
its own account or for the account of any other Persons (other than (i) a
Registration Statement under _Section 2_ or _3_ (it being understood that
this clause (i) does not limit the rights of Holders to make written requests
pursuant to _Section 2(a)_), (ii) a Registration Statement on Form S-4 or
Form S-8 or any successor form to such forms, (iii) a registration of Common
Stock solely relating to an offering and sale to employees or directors of the
Company pursuant to any employee share plan or other employee benefit plan
arrangement, or (iv) a registration in connection with a direct or indirect
acquisition by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries of another Person or a
similar business combination transaction, however structured) then, as soon as
practicable (but in no event less than ten (10) calendar days prior to the
proposed date of the launch of the underwritten Public Offering or the filing
of such Registration Statement, as applicable), the Company shall give written
notice of such proposed offering or filing to the Holders, and such notice
shall offer the Holders the opportunity to register under such Registration
Statement or include in such underwritten Public Offering such number of
Registrable Securities as each such Holder may request in writing (a "
_Piggyback Registration_ "). Subject to _Section 4(b)_ and _Section 4(c)_,
the Company shall include in such Registration Statement or underwritten
Public Offering all such Registrable Securities that are requested to be

 



      
 

 



 

included therein within five (5) calendar days after the receipt by such
Holders of any such notice; _provided_ , that if at any time after giving
written notice of its intention to sell any Common Stock in an underwritten
Public Offering and prior to the launch date, or to register any Common Stock
and prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement filed in
connection with such registration, the Company shall determine for any reason
not to sell or register or to delay such sale or registration, the Company
shall give written notice of such determination to each Holder and, thereupon,
(A) in the case of a determination not to sell or register, shall be relieved
of its obligation to register any Registrable Securities in connection with
such sale or registration (but not from its obligation to pay the Registration
Expenses in connection therewith), without prejudice, however, to the rights
of the Holders to request that such registration be effected as a Demand
Registration (subject to the provisions governing withdrawal set forth in
_Section 2(b)_) or, if applicable, a Shelf Offering Request and any
Underwritten Shelf Takedown related thereto (subject to the provisions
governing withdrawal set forth in _Section 3(e)(i)_), and (B) in the case of
a determination to delay selling or registering, in the absence of a request
for a Demand Registration, Shelf Offering Request or Underwritten Shelf
Takedown, shall be permitted to delay selling or registering any Registrable
Securities, for the same period as the delay in registering such other Common
Stock; _provided_ , that if such registration or sale involves an underwritten
Public Offering, all such Holders requesting to be included in the Companys
registration or sale must sell their Registrable Securities to the
underwriters selected as provided in _Section 7(j)_ on the same terms and
conditions as apply to the Company or the other Person requesting such
registration or sale, as applicable, with, in the case of a combined primary
and secondary offering, such differences, including any with respect to
representations and warranties and indemnification, as may be customary or
appropriate in combined primary and secondary offerings, and the Company shall
make arrangements with the managing underwriter so that each such Holder may
participate in such Underwritten Offering.

 



 

(b) _Priority of Registrations Pursuant to a Piggyback Registration_. If a
Piggyback Registration involves an underwritten Public Offering (other than
any Demand Registration or Underwritten Shelf Takedown, in which case the
provisions with respect to priority of inclusion in such offering set forth in
_Section 2(g)_ or _Section 3(e)(ii)_, respectively, shall apply) and the
managing underwriter advises the Board in writing (a copy of which shall be
provided to each Holder) that, in its view, the number of Company Shares that
the Company and such Holders intend to include in such registration exceeds
the Maximum Offering Size, the Company shall include in such registration, in
the following priority, up to the Maximum Offering Size:

 



 

(i) first, so much of the Company Securities proposed to be registered for the
account of the Company (or for the account of such other initiating Person) as
would not cause the offering to exceed the Maximum Offering Size;

 



 

(ii) second, and only if all of the securities referred to in clause (i) have
been included, all Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
registration by any Holders pursuant to this _Section 4_ (allocated, if
necessary for the offering not to exceed the Maximum Offering Size, pro rata
among such Holders and such other holders of Registrable Securities on the
basis of the relative number of Registrable Securities owned by such Holders
and such other holders; _provided_ , that any securities thereby allocated to
a Holder that exceed such Holders request shall be reallocated among the
remaining Holders and other holders in like manner); and

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) third, and only if all of the securities referred to in clauses (i) and
(ii) have been included, any securities proposed to be registered for the
account of any other Persons with such priorities among them as the Company
shall determine.

 



 

(c) _Piggyback Withdrawal_. Each Holder shall be permitted to withdraw all or
part of its Registrable Securities from a Piggyback Registration at any time
prior to the effectiveness of such Registration Statement or at any time prior
to 7:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date on which the underwritten Public
Offering is anticipated to launch, as the case may be. Subject to _Section
16_, no registration effected under this _Section 4_ shall relieve the
Company of its obligations to effect a Demand Registration to the extent
required by _Section 2_ or a Shelf Offering Request or Underwritten Shelf
Takedown to the extent required by _Section 3_.

 



 

(d) _Payment of Expenses for Piggyback Registrations_. The Company shall pay
all Registration Expenses in connection with each Piggyback Registration,
regardless of whether such registration is effected.

 



 

5. _Standstill; Lock-up Agreements_.

 



 

(a) _Standstill_. During the Standstill Period, each Holder shall not,
directly or indirectly, and shall cause its Representatives (to the extent
acting on behalf of the Holder) and Group Members directly or indirectly not
to, without the prior written consent of, or waiver by, the Company, (i) sell
or offer to sell any Company Securities (including any Voting Securities, ) or
Derivative Instruments, or direct or indirect rights to acquire any Company
Securities (including any Voting Securities) or Derivative Instruments, or any
securities or indebtedness convertible or exchangeable for any such
securities, (ii) cause to be filed or submitted a registration statement,
prospectus or prospectus supplement (or amendment or supplement thereto) with
respect to any such registration, or (iii) publicly announce any intention to
do any of the foregoing.

 



 

(b) _Lock-up Agreements_.

 



 

(i) To the extent requested by the lead underwriter in connection with each
Underwritten Offering, the Company and each Participating Holder shall agree
not to effect any public sale or distribution of any Company Securities or
other security of the Company (except as part of such Underwritten Offering)
during the period beginning on the date that is estimated by the Company, in
good faith and provided in writing to such Holder, to be the seventh (7th)
calendar day prior to the effective date of the applicable Registration
Statement (or the anticipated launch date in the case of a "take-down" off of
an already effective Shelf Registration Statement) until the earlier of (i)
such time as the Company and the lead managing underwriter shall agree and
(ii) sixty (60) calendar days after the effective date of the applicable
Registration Statement (or the pricing date in the case of a "take-down" off
of an already effective Shelf Registration Statement); _provided_ , that the
Company shall cause all directors and executive officers of the Company, and
all other Persons with registration rights with respect to the Companys
securities (whether or not pursuant to this Agreement) to enter into
agreements similar to those contained in this _Section 5(b)(i)_ (without
regard to this proviso), subject to exceptions for gifts, sales pursuant to
pre-existing 105-1 plans and other customary exclusions

 



      
 

 



 

agreed to by such managing underwriter; _provided further_ , that the lead
managing underwriter may extend such period as necessary to comply with
applicable FINRA rules.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may effect a public sale or
distribution of securities of the type described above and during the periods
described above if such sale or distribution is made pursuant to registrations
on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or any successor form to such forms or as part of any
registration of securities for offering and sale to employees or directors of
the Company pursuant to any employee share plan or other employee benefit plan
arrangement. The Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain from each holder of restricted securities of the Company which
securities are the same as or similar to the Registrable Securities being
registered, or any restricted securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any of such securities, an agreement not to effect any public
sale or distribution of such securities during any such period referred to in
this _Section 5_, except as part of any such registration, if permitted.

 



 

6. _Other Registration Rights_. The Company represents and warrants that it is not a party to, or otherwise subject to, any agreement (other than as provided herein) granting registration rights to any other Person with respect to any equity securities of the Company. The Company shall not grant to any Person the right, other than as set forth herein, and except to employees of the Company with respect to registrations on Form S-8, to request the Company to register any Company Securities except such rights as are not more favorable than or inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders and that do not violate the rights or adversely affect the priorities of the Holders set forth herein.

 



 

7. _Registration Procedures_. In connection with any registration pursuant to _Section 2_, _Section 3_ or _Section 4_, subject to the provisions of such Sections:

 



 

(a) Prior to filing a Registration Statement covering Registrable Securities
or prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, the Company shall
furnish to each Participating Shareholder and each underwriter, if any, of the
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement copies of such
Registration Statement as proposed to be filed, and thereafter the Company
shall furnish to such Participating Shareholder and underwriter, if any,
without charge such number of copies of such Registration Statement, each
amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits thereto
and documents incorporated by reference therein), the prospectus included in
such Registration Statement (including each preliminary prospectus and any
summary prospectus) and any other prospectus filed under Rule 424 or Rule 430A
under the Securities Act and such other documents as such Participating
Shareholder or underwriter may reasonably request in order to facilitate the
disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Participating
Shareholder. Each Participating Shareholder shall have the right to request
that the Company modify any information contained in such Registration
Statement, amendment and supplement thereto pertaining to such Participating
Shareholder and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to comply with
such request; _provided_ , that the Company shall not have any obligation to
so modify any information if the Company reasonably expects that so doing
would cause the prospectus to contain an untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) In connection with any filing of any Registration Statement or prospectus
or amendment or supplement thereto, the Company shall cause such document (i)
to comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder and (ii) with respect to
information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion in the
Registration Statement, to not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading.

 



 

(c) The Company shall promptly notify each Holder of such Registrable
Securities and the underwriter(s) and, if requested by such Holder or the
underwriter(s), confirm in writing, when a Registration Statement has become
effective and when any post-effective amendments and supplements thereto
become effective.

 



 

(d) The Company shall furnish counsel for each underwriter, if any, and for
the Holders of such Registrable Securities with copies of any written comments
from the SEC or any state securities authority or any written request by the
SEC or any state securities authority for amendments or supplements to a
Registration Statement or prospectus or for additional information generally.

 



 

(e) After the filing of the Registration Statement, the Company shall (i)
cause the related prospectus to be supplemented by any required prospectus
supplement, and, as so supplemented, to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under
the Securities Act, (ii) comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with
respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement during the applicable period in accordance with the
intended methods of disposition by the Participating Shareholders set forth in
such Registration Statement or supplement to such prospectus and (iii)
promptly notify each Participating Shareholder holding Registrable Securities
covered by such Registration Statement of any stop order issued or threatened
by the SEC or any state securities commission and use commercially reasonable
best efforts to prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if
entered.

 



 

(f) The Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to (i) register or
qualify the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement
under such securities or "blue sky" Laws of such jurisdictions in the United
States as any Participating Shareholder holding such Registrable Securities
reasonably (in light of such Participating Shareholders intended plan of
distribution) requests and (ii) cause such Registrable Securities to be
registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities
as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of the Company
and do any and all other acts and things that may be reasonably necessary or
advisable to enable such Participating Shareholder to consummate the
disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Participating
Shareholder, _provided_ , that the Company shall not be required to (A)
qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be required to qualify but for this _Section 7(f)_, (B) subject
itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (C) consent to general service
of process in any such jurisdiction.

 



 

(g) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to list such Registrable
Securities on the principal securities exchange on which the Companys common
stock is then listed and

 



      
 

 



 

provide a transfer agent, registrar and CUSIP number for all such Registrable
Securities not later than the effective date of such Registration Statement.

 



 

(h) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each
Holder and the underwriter or managing underwriter, if any, to facilitate the
timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable
Securities to be sold and not bearing any restrictive legends; and enable such
Registrable Securities to be in such denominations (consistent with the
provisions of the governing documents thereof) and registered in such names as
each Holder or the underwriter or managing underwriter, if any, may reasonably
request at least two (2) Business Days prior to any sale of Registrable
Securities.

 



 

(i) The Company shall immediately notify each Participating Shareholder
holding such Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement, at
any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under
the Securities Act, of the occurrence of an event requiring the preparation of
a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered
to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such prospectus will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading and promptly prepare and make available to each such
Participating Shareholder and file with the SEC any such supplement or
amendment subject to any suspension rights contained herein.

 



 

(j) (1) The requesting Holder(s) shall have the right to select an underwriter
or underwriters in connection with any underwritten Public Offering resulting
from the exercise of a Demand Registration or Underwritten Shelf Takedown upon
consultation with the Company and (2) the Company shall have the right to
select an underwriter or underwriters in connection with any other
underwritten Public Offering. In connection with any Public Offering, the
Company shall enter into customary agreements (including an underwriting
agreement in customary form) and take all other actions as are reasonably
required and customary in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of
such Registrable Securities in any such Public Offering, including the
engagement of a "qualified independent underwriter" in connection with the
qualification of the underwriting arrangements with FINRA.

 



 

(k) Upon execution of confidentiality agreements in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, the Company shall make available
during regular business hours for inspection by any Participating Shareholder
and any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to a
Registration Statement being filed by the Company pursuant to this _Section
7_ and any attorney, accountant or other professional retained by any such
Participating Shareholder or underwriter (collectively, the " _Inspectors_ "),
all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties
of the Company (collectively, the " _Records_ ") as shall be reasonably
necessary or desirable to enable them to exercise their due diligence
responsibility, and cause the Companys officers, directors and employees to
supply all information reasonably requested by any Inspectors in connection
with such Registration Statement (including by participation in a reasonable
number of diligence calls). Records that the Company determines, in good
faith, to be confidential and that it notifies the Inspectors are confidential
shall not be disclosed by the Inspectors unless (i) the disclosure of such
Records is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in such
Registration Statement or (ii) the release of such Records is

 



      
 

 



 

required pursuant to applicable Law or regulation or judicial process. Each
Participating Shareholder agrees that information obtained by it as a result
of such inspections shall be deemed confidential and shall not be used by it
or its Affiliates as the basis for any market transactions in the Company
Securities unless and until such information is made generally available to
the public. Each Participating Shareholder further agrees that, upon learning
that disclosure of such Records is sought in a court of competent
jurisdiction, it shall give notice to the Company and allow the Company, at
its expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of the
Records deemed confidential.

 



 

(l) The Company shall furnish to each Participating Shareholder and to each
such underwriter, if any, a signed counterpart, addressed to such
Participating Shareholder or underwriter, of (i) an opinion or opinions of
counsel to the Company and (ii) a comfort letter or comfort letters from the
Companys independent certified public accountants, each in customary form and
covering such matters of the kind customarily covered by opinions or comfort
letters, as the case may be, as the managing underwriter therefor reasonably
requests.

 



 

(m) The Company shall take all commercially reasonable actions to ensure that
any free-writing prospectus utilized in connection with any Demand
Registration, Underwritten Shelf Takedown or other offering off of a Shelf
Registration Statement or Piggyback Registration hereunder complies in all
material respects with the Securities Act, is filed in accordance with the
Securities Act to the extent required thereby, is retained in accordance with
the Securities Act to the extent required thereby and, when taken together
with the related prospectus, shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

 



 

(n) The Company shall otherwise use all commercially reasonable efforts to
comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, and make
available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an
earnings statement or such other document that shall satisfy the provisions of
_Section 11(a)_ of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder.

 



 

(o) The Company may require each such Participating Shareholder promptly to
furnish in writing to the Company the Notice, Agreement and Questionnaire and
such other information regarding the distribution of the Registrable
Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request and such
other information as may be legally required or the Company may deem
reasonably advisable in connection with such registration and shall not have
any obligation to include a Participating Shareholder on any Registration
Statement if the Notice, Agreement and Questionnaire or such other information
is not promptly provided; _provided_ , that, prior to excluding such
Participating Shareholder on the basis of its failure to provide the Notice,
Agreement and Questionnaire or such other information, the Company must
furnish in writing a reminder to such Participating Shareholder requesting the
Notice, Agreement and Questionnaire and such other information at least three
(3) days prior to filing the applicable Registration Statement.

 



 

(p) Each such Participating Shareholder agrees that, upon receipt of any
notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in
_Section 7(i)_, such

 



      
 

 



 

Participating Shareholder shall forthwith discontinue disposition of
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering such
Registrable Securities until such Participating Shareholders receipt of the
copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by _Section
7(i)_, and, if so directed by the Company, such Participating Shareholder
shall deliver to the Company all copies, other than any permanent file copies
then in such Participating Shareholders possession, of the most recent
prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such
notice. If the Company shall give such notice, the Company shall extend the
period during which such Registration Statement shall be maintained effective
by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the
giving of notice pursuant to _Section 7(i)_ to the date when the Company
shall make available to such Participating Shareholder a prospectus
supplemented or amended to conform with the requirements of _Section 7(i)_.

 



 

(q) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to list all
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement on any
securities exchange or quotation system on which any of the Registrable
Securities are then listed or traded.

 



 

(r) The Company shall have appropriate officers of the Company (i) prepare and
make presentations at any "road shows" and before analysts and rating
agencies, as the case may be, (ii) otherwise use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate as reasonably requested by the underwriters in the
offering, marketing or selling of the Registrable Securities, including, by
executing customary underwriting agreements and (iii) otherwise use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate as reasonably requested by the
Holders in the marketing of the Registrable Securities.

 



 

8. _Indemnification by the Company_.

 



 

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Participating
Shareholder holding Registrable Securities covered by a Registration
Statement, each member, trustee, limited or general partner thereof, each
member, trustee, limited or general partner of each such member, limited or
general partner, each of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors,
stockholders, shareholders, employees, advisors and agents, each Person, if
any, who controls such Person within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each of their
Representatives from and against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses (including reasonable expenses of investigation and
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) (" _Damages_ ") caused by or relating
to (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in (A) any Registration Statement or prospectus relating to the
Registrable Securities (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have
furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), any preliminary prospectus
or any "issuer free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433 of the
Securities Act) or (B) any application or other document or communication
executed by or on behalf of the Company or based upon written information
furnished by or on behalf of the Company filed in any jurisdiction in order to
qualify any securities covered by such registration under the securities Laws
thereof, (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of
the Securities Act or any other similar federal or state

 



      
 

 



 

securities Laws or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder applicable to
the Company and relating to action or inaction required of the Company in
connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance, except in
all cases insofar as such Damages are caused by or related to any such untrue
statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission so made based
upon or contained in any information furnished in writing to the Company by
such Participating Shareholder expressly for use therein or by such
Participating Shareholders failure to deliver a copy of the prospectus, the
issuer free writing prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto after
the Company has furnished such Participating Shareholder with a sufficient
number of copies of the same.

 



 

(b) The Company also agrees to indemnify any underwriters of the Registrable
Securities, their officers and directors and each Person who controls such
underwriters within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section
20 of the Exchange Act on substantially the same basis as that of the
indemnification of the Participating Shareholders provided in this _Section
8_ or otherwise on commercially reasonable terms negotiated on an aims length
basis with such underwriters.

 



 

9. _Indemnification by Participating Shareholders_. Each Participating Shareholder holding Registrable Securities included in any Registration Statement agrees, severally but not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers, directors and agents and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity from the Company contained in _Section 8(a)(i)_ and _Section 8(a)(ii)_ to such Participating Shareholder, but only with respect to information furnished in writing by such Participating Shareholder or on such Participating Shareholders behalf expressly for use in any Registration Statement or prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any preliminary prospectus or any "issuer free writing prospectus." Each such Participating Shareholder also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any underwriters of the Registrable Securities, their officers and directors and each Person who controls such underwriters within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the Company provided in this _Section 9_. As a condition to including Registrable Securities in any Registration Statement filed in accordance herewith, the Company may require that it shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from any underwriter to indemnify and hold it harmless to the extent customarily provided by underwriters with respect to similar securities. No Participating Shareholder shall be liable under this _Section 9_ for any Damages in excess of the gross proceeds realized by such Participating Shareholder in the sale of Registrable Securities of such Participating Shareholder to which such Damages relate.

 



 

10. _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. If any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to _Section 8_ or _Section 9_, such Person (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing and the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, and shall assume the payment of all fees and expenses; _provided_ , that the failure of any Indemnified Party to so notify the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder except to the extent and only to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure to notify. In any such
proceeding, any Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own
counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
such Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall have mutually agreed in writing to the retention of such counsel,
(ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed to assume the defense of such
claim or to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party,
or (iii) in the reasonable judgment of such Indemnified Party representation
of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential differing interests between them. It is understood that, in
connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same
jurisdiction, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the reasonable
fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to
any local counsel) at any time for all such Indemnified Parties, and that all
such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case
of any such separate firm for the Indemnified Parties, such firm shall be
designated in writing by the Indemnified Parties. The Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its
written consent, but if settled with such consent, or if there be a final
judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify and hold
harmless such Indemnified Parties from and against any loss or liability (to
the extent stated above) by reason of such settlement or judgment. Without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), no Indemnifying Party shall effect any
settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any
Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been
sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such proceeding.

 



 

11. _Survival_. Subject to a Holder delivering a properly completed (as solely determined by the Company), executed and acknowledged Notice, Agreement and Questionnaire to the Company, _Section 8_, _Section 9_, _Section 10_ and _Section 12_ hereto will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party or any officer, director or controlling Person of such Indemnified Party and will survive the transfer of securities.

 



 

12. _Contribution_.

 



 

(a) If the indemnification provided for herein is unavailable to the
Indemnified Parties in respect of any Damages, then each such Indemnifying
Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Damages
(i) as between the Company and the Participating Shareholders holding
Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement on the one hand and
the underwriters on the other, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative benefits received by the Company and such Participating
Shareholders on the one hand and the underwriters on the other, from the
offering of the Registrable Securities, or if such allocation is not permitted
by applicable Law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only
the relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and such
Participating Shareholders on the one hand and of such underwriters on the
other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such
Damages, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations,

 



      
 

 



 

and (ii) as between the Company on the one hand and each Participating
Shareholder on the other, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the Company and of each Participating Shareholder in
connection with such statements or omissions, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and
Participating Shareholders on the one hand and such underwriters on the other
shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the
offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting
expenses) received by the Company and Participating Shareholders bear to the
total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such underwriters, in
each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the applicable
prospectus. The relative fault of the Company and Participating Shareholders
on the one hand and of such underwriters on the other shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and Participating
Shareholders or by such underwriters. The relative fault of the Company on the
one hand and of each Participating Shareholder on the other shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact relates to information supplied by such party, and the
parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission.

 



 

(b) The Company and the Participating Shareholders agree that it would not be
just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section 12_ were
determined by pro rata allocation (even if the underwriters were treated as
one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does
not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the
immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified
Party as a result of the Damages referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth
above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 12_, no Participating
Shareholder shall be required to contribute any amount for Damages in excess
of the gross proceeds realized by Participating Shareholder in the sale of
Registrable Securities of Participating Shareholder to which such Damages
relate. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of _Section 11(f)_ of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution
from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Each
Participating Shareholders obligation to contribute pursuant to this _Section
12_ is several in the proportion that the net proceeds of the offering
received by Participating Shareholder bears to the total net proceeds of the
offering received by all such Participating Shareholders and not joint.

 



 

13. _Participation in Public Offering_.

 



 

(a) No Person may participate in any Public Offering hereunder unless such
Person (i) agrees to sell such Persons securities on the basis provided in
any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to
approve such arrangements ( _provided_ , that no Holder of Registrable
Securities will be required to sell more than the number of Registrable
Securities that such Holder has requested the Company include in any
Registration Statement) and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires,
powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting

 



      
 

 



 

agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such
underwriting arrangements and the provisions set forth herein in respect of
registration rights.

 



 

(b) Each Person that is participating in any registration hereunder agrees
that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the occurrence of any
event of the kind described in _Section 7(i)_ above, such Person shall
immediately discontinue the disposition of its Registrable Securities pursuant
to the Registration Statement until such Persons receipt of the copies of a
supplemented or amended prospectus as contemplated by _Section 7(i)_. In the
event the Company has given any such notice, the applicable time period during
which a Registration Statement is to remain effective shall be extended (
_provided_ , that the Company shall not cause any Registration Statement to
remain effective beyond the latest date allowed by applicable Law) by the
number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of
such notice pursuant to this paragraph to and including the date when each
Holder of Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement shall
have received the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus
contemplated by _Section 7(i)_.

 



 

14. _Compliance with Rule 144 and Rule 144A_. At the request of any Holder who proposes to sell securities in compliance with Rule 144 of the Securities Act, the Company shall (i) cooperate, to the extent commercially reasonable, with such Holder, (ii) forthwith furnish to such Holder a written statement of compliance with the filing requirements of the SEC as set forth in Rule 144, as such rule may be amended from time to time, (iii) make available to the public and such Holders such information, and take such action as is reasonably necessary, to enable the Holders of Registrable Securities to make sales pursuant to Rule 144, and (iv) use its reasonable best efforts to list such Holders Company Shares on the NYSE. Unless the Company is subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company will provide to the holder of Registrable Securities and to any prospective purchaser of Registrable Securities under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, the information described in Rule 144A(d)(4) of the Securities Act.

 



 

15. _Selling Expenses_. All Selling Expenses relating to the offer and sale of Registrable Securities registered under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne and paid by the Holders of such Registrable Securities, in proportion to the number of Registrable Securities included in such registration for each such Holder.

 



 

16. _Prohibition on Requests; Holders  Obligations_.

 



 

(a) No Holder shall, without the Companys consent, be entitled to deliver a
request for a Demand Registration or a Shelf Offering Request or Underwritten
Shelf Takedown if less than 90 calendar days have elapsed since (A) the
effective date of a prior Registration Statement in connection with a Demand
Registration, Shelf Registration or Piggyback Registration, (B) the date of
withdrawal by the Participating Shareholders of a Demand Registration or
Underwritten Shelf Takedown or (C) the pricing date of any Underwritten
Offering effected by the Company; _provided_ , in each case, that such Holder
has been provided with an opportunity to participate in the prior offering and
either (i) has refused or not promptly accepted such opportunity or (ii) has
not been cut back to less than 50% of the Registrable Securities requested to
be included by such Holder.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) No Holder of Registrable Securities shall be entitled to sell any of such
Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement, unless such Holder has
timely furnished the Company with all information required to be disclosed in
order to make the information previously furnished to the Company by such
Holder not misleading and any other information regarding such Holder and the
distribution of such Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to
time reasonably request pursuant to _Section 7(o)_. Any sale of any
Registrable Securities by any Holder shall constitute a representation and
warranty by such Holder that the information of such Holder furnished in
writing by or on behalf of such Holder, including in such Holders Notice,
Agreement and Questionnaire (all such information, " _Holder Information_ "),
to the Company does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements in such
Holder Information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Furthermore, if the Company is required to file a
subsequent Registration Statement upon expiration of effectiveness of the
Registration Statement naming a Holder, the Company shall be under no
obligation to include such Holder as a selling securityholder if such Holder
does not timely deliver an updated properly completed (as solely determined by
the Company), executed and acknowledged Notice, Agreement and Questionnaire
and other information upon request by the Company therefore pursuant to
_Section 7(o)_.

 



 

17. _Corporate Governance_.

 



 

(a) _Composition of the Board_.

 



 

(i) Subject to _Section 17(a)(iv)_ below, two directors of the Board (each, a
" _Director_ ") shall be individuals designated in writing to the Company by
MDLZ (each, a " _MDLZ Designee_ "), which individuals shall at all times be
executive officers of MDLZ and shall initially be the Executive Vice President
and General Counsel and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer.

 



 

(ii) Upon the resignation, retirement or other removal of any MDLZ Designee,
MDLZ shall be entitled, subject to _Section 17(a)(iv)_ below, promptly to

(iii) Each of the Company and the Holders shall use its reasonable best
efforts to give effect to _Section 17(a)(i)_; in particular, (A) each Holder

controls (and shall procure that each of its Affiliates votes all stock that
it holds or controls) in favor of appointing each MDLZ Designee as a Director

(other than MDLZ) shall take any action to remove, or oppose the appointment
of, a MDLZ Designee as a Director.

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) If MDLZ and its Affiliates beneficially own less than 8% of the Company
Shares, then MDLZ shall promptly cause one of such MDLZ Designees to resign
and the number of MDLZ Designees permissible hereunder shall be permanently
reduced to one. If MDLZ and its Affiliates beneficially own less than 5% of
the Company Shares, then MDLZ shall promptly cause a second MDLZ Designee to
resign and the number of MDLZ Designees permissible hereunder shall be
permanently reduced to zero.

 



 

(b) _Committees_. For so long as MDLZ is permitted to appoint at least one (1)
MDLZ Designee pursuant to _Section 17(a)_, to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws (including any requirements under the Exchange Act or the
rules of the New York Stock Exchange or any other applicable securities
exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed), each committee of the
Board shall include at least one MDLZ Designee.

 



 

(c) _Board Authority Matters_. For so long as MDLZ is permitted to appoint at
least one (1) MDLZ Designee pursuant to _Section 17(a)_, the Company shall
not enter into or effectuate any of the following without the prior approval
of the Board:

 



 

(i) any issuance of shares of the Company or securities convertible or

exercisable for such shares (other than options or other equity awards granted

Boards Compensation Committee or Special Award Committee),

 



 

(ii) the declaration or payment of any dividend or other distribution with
regard to any security of the Company,

Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee), or

 



 

(ix) the approval of a decision which may have a material implication for the
reputation of the Company Group.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to be Consistent_. Each of the
Company and each Holder shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause
to be taken all lawful action necessary or appropriate to ensure that at all
times the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Company contain
provisions consistent with the terms of this Agreement (including without
limitation this _Section 17_) and none of the Certificate of Incorporation or
the Bylaws of the Company or any of the corresponding constituent documents of
the Companys Subsidiaries contain any provisions inconsistent therewith or
which would in any way nullify or impair the terms of this Agreement or the
rights of the Company or any Holder hereunder.

 



 

(e) _Amendment of Related Party Transaction Policy_. For so long as MDLZ is
permitted to appoint at least one (1) MDLZ Designee pursuant to _Section
17(a)_, the Company shall not amend or terminate its related party transaction
policy adopted on the Closing Date, unless such amendments are required by
applicable Law (including any requirements under the rules of the New York
Stock Exchange or any other applicable securities exchange on which the Common
Stock is then listed), without the prior written consent of MDLZ.

 



 

18. _Information Rights_.

 



 

(a) For so long as MDLZ accounts for its investment in the Company under the
equity method of accounting (determined in accordance with the generally
accepted accounting principles as applicable to MDLZ from time to time), the
Company agrees that:

 



 

(i) The Company shall provide MDLZ (A) within 60 days after the end of each
fiscal year, with the consolidated financial results for of the Companys
consolidated group (the " _Company Group_ ") for such fiscal year (including a
profit and loss account, balance sheet, cash flow and statement of other
comprehensive income), (B) promptly upon availability, the annual accounts for
each member of the Company Group (except where such accounts or audits are not
legally required), (C) within 30 days after the end of each fiscal quarter,
unaudited consolidated condensed financial results of the Company Group for
such fiscal quarter (including a profit and loss account, balance sheet, cash
flow and statement of other comprehensive income) and (D) with such financial
information or documents in the possession of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries as MDLZ may reasonably request in writing in connection with the
preparation of MDLZs public earnings releases or other press releases,
Current Reports on Form 8-K, Annual Reports to Shareholders, Annual Reports on
Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and any other proxy, information and
registration statements, reports, notices, prospectuses and any other filings
made by MDLZ with the SEC or any other Governmental Authority, including
MDLZs unaudited quarterly financial statements and annual audited financial
statements (collectively, the " _MDLZ Public Filings_ ");

 



 

(ii) The Company shall cooperate, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Companys independent certified public accounts (the " _Company s
Auditors_") to cooperate, with MDLZ to the extent reasonably requested in
writing by MDLZ in the preparation of the MDLZ Public Filings. The Company
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to provide to MDLZ all information
that MDLZ reasonably requests in writing in connection with any MDLZ Public
Filings that, in the reasonable judgment of MDLZ upon consultation with its
legal counsel, is required to be disclosed or incorporated by reference
therein under any applicable Law. The

 



      
 

 



 

Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide such information to
enable MDLZ to prepare and release all MDLZ Public Filings on a timely basis.
To the extent required in such filing, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Companys Auditors to consent to any reference to
them as experts in any MDLZ Public Filings required under applicable Law;

 



 

(iii) The Company and MDLZ shall share with each other (subject to any agreed
protocols) aggregate security position information, within 60 days after the
end of each fiscal quarter, for use in their respective compliance programs
and shall coordinate share ownership reporting for such purpose; and

 



 

(iv) The Company will, within 25 days after the end of each fiscal quarter,
make the Companys controller available for a discussion with MDLZ with
regards to updates to the Companys business and financial results with
respect to such fiscal quarter.

 



 

(b) With respect to any information provided by the Company:

 



 

(i) Subject to the requirements of law and to except the extent required to be
included in MDLZ Public Filings, MDLZ shall keep confidential, and shall cause
its Representatives to keep confidential, all information and documents
obtained pursuant to this _Section 18_ unless such information (A) is or
becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this _Section
18(b)_ by it or its Representatives; (B) was within its possession prior to
being furnished to it by or on behalf of the Company, provided that the source
of such information was not known by it to be bound by a confidentiality
agreement with, or other contractual or legal obligation of confidentiality
to, the Company with respect to such information; (C) is or becomes available
to it or any of its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source
other than the Company or any of its Representatives; _provided_ that such
source was not known to it to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or
other contractual or legal obligation of confidentiality to, the Company with
respect to such information; or (D) is independently developed by or on its
behalf without violating any of its obligations under this _Section 18(b)_.

 



 

(ii) In the event MDLZ believes, upon consultation with its legal counsel,
that it is legally required to disclose any information or documents
contemplated by _Section 18(b)(i)_ (but not including any information
required to be included in MDLZ Public Filings), it shall to the extent
possible under the circumstances provide reasonable prior written notice to
the Company so that the Company may, at its own expense, seek a protective
order or otherwise take reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of
such information.

 



 

(iii) The rights of MDLZ and the obligations of the Company pursuant to this
_Section 18(b)_ shall be subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange
of information and other applicable Laws.

 



      
 

 



 

19. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

(a) _Remedies; Specific Performance_.

 



 

(i) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Party shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred by this Agreement, or by law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy shall not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

 



 

(ii) The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor.
It is accordingly agreed that, at any time prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8(j)_, the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
court referred to in _Section 8(g)_, without proof of actual damages (and
each Party waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. The Parties further agree not to
assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach.

 



 

(b) _Amendments and Waivers_. The provisions of this Agreement (other than
_Sections 17_ and _18_ ), including the provisions of this sentence, may not
be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures
from the provisions hereof may not be given, without the written consent of
the Company and each Holder of outstanding Registrable Securities.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the
provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the
rights of Holders of Registrable Securities whose securities are being sold
pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement and that does not directly or
indirectly affect the rights of other Holders of Registrable Securities may be
given by each Holder of the Registrable Securities being sold by such Holders
pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the provisions of this sentence may not be amended, modified, or supplemented
except in accordance with the provisions of the immediately preceding
sentence. Each Holder of Registrable Securities outstanding at the time of any
such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent or thereafter
shall be bound by any such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or
consent effected pursuant to this _Section 8(b)_, whether or not any notice,
writing or marking indicating such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver
or consent appears on the Registrable Securities or is delivered to such
Holder. The provisions of _Sections 17_ and _18_ (and the provisions of this
sentence) may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or
consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, without
the written consent of the Company and MDLZ.

 



 

(c) _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given
hereunder by any Party to the others shall be in writing and delivered
personally or sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, by
facsimile or electronic mail or overnight courier:

(ii) if to a Holder, at the most current address given by such Holder to the
Company in a Notice, Agreement and Questionnaire or any amendment thereto or,

8. Plan of Distribution:

 



 

Except as set forth below, the Selling Securityholder (including its donees or
pledgees) intends to distribute the Registrable Securities listed above in
Item (3) pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement only as follows (if at
all): such Registrable Securities may be sold from time to time directly by
the Selling Securityholder or alternatively through underwriters, broker-
dealers or agents. If the Registrable Securities are sold through
underwriters, broker-dealers or agents, the Selling Securityholder shall be
responsible for underwriting discounts or commissions or agents commissions.
Such Registrable Securities may be sold in one or more transactions at fixed
prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, at varying prices
determined at the time of sale or at negotiated prices. Such sales may be
effected in transactions (which may involve crosses or block transactions) (i)
on any national securities exchange or quotation service on which the

the over-the-counter market, (iii) in transactions otherwise than on such
exchanges or services or in the over-the-counter market or (iv) through the
writing of options. The Selling Securityholder may pledge or grant a security
interest in some or all of the Registrable Securities owned by it and, if it
defaults in the performance of its secured obligations, the pledgees or
secured parties may offer and sell the Registrable Securities from time to
time pursuant to the prospectus. The Selling Securityholder also may transfer
and donate shares in other circumstances in which certain cases the
transferees, donees, pledgees or other successors in interest shall be the
selling Securityholder for purposes of the prospectus.

 



 

State any exceptions here:

 



 



      
 

 



 

 **Note** : In no event may such method(s) of distribution take the form of an
underwritten offering of the Registrable Securities without the prior
agreement of the Company.

 



 

(i) The Selling Securityholder acknowledges that it understands its obligation
to comply with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder
relating to stock manipulation, particularly Regulation M thereunder (or any
successor rules or regulations), in connection with any offering of
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement. The
Selling Securityholder agrees that neither it nor any person acting on its
behalf shall engage in any transaction in violation of such provisions.

 



 

(j) In accordance with the Selling Securityholders obligation under the
Investor Rights Agreement to provide such information as may be required by
law for inclusion in the Shelf Registration Statement, the Selling
Securityholder agrees to provide any additional information the Company may
reasonably request and to promptly notify the Company of any inaccuracies or

 **Appendix A**

 



 

 **DEFINITION OF "BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP"**

 



 

1. A "Beneficial Owner" of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise has or shares:

 



 

(a) Voting power which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of,
such security; and/or

 



 

(b) Investment power which includes the power to dispose, or direct the
disposition of, such security.

 



 

Please note that either voting power or investment power, or both, is
sufficient for you to be considered the beneficial owner of shares.

 



 

2. Any person who, directly or indirectly, creates or uses a trust, proxy, power of attorney, pooling arrangement or any other contract, arrangement or device with the purpose or effect of divesting such person of beneficial ownership of a security or preventing the vesting of such beneficial ownership as part of a plan or scheme to evade the reporting requirements of the federal securities acts shall be deemed to be the beneficial owner of such security.

 



 

3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), a person is deemed to be the "beneficial owner" of a security if that person has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of such security within 60 days, including but not limited to any right to acquire: (a) through the exercise of any option, warrant or right; (b) through the conversion of a security; (c) pursuant to the power to revoke a trust, discretionary account or similar arrangement; or (d) pursuant to the automatic termination of a trust, discretionary account or similar arrangement; _provided_ , _however_ , any person who acquires a security or power specified in (a), (b) or (c) above, with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of the issuer, or in connection with or as a participant in any transaction having such purpose or effect, immediately upon such acquisition shall be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the securities which may be acquired through the exercise or conversion of such security or power.

 **FORM OF TAX REPRESENTATION LETTER**

 



 

January 29, 2018

 



 

McDermott Will and Emery LLP

 

500 North Capitol Street, N.W.

 

Washington, D.C. 20001

 



 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



 

In connection with the opinion (the " _Tax Opinion_ ") to be delivered by
McDermott Will and Emery LLP, an Illinois limited liability partnership ("
_McDermott_ "), pursuant to Section 8.02(c) of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") dated as of January 29, 2018 among Dr
Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _DPSG_ "), Salt Merger
Sub, a Delaware corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Maple Parent Holdings
Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Maple Parent"_ ), the undersigned, an
officer of Maple Parent, is making representations in this letter on behalf of
Maple Parent. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement,(1) Merger Sub will merge with
and into Maple Parent with Maple Parent surviving as a wholly-owned direct
subsidiary of DPSG (the " _Merger_ "). Recognizing that (i) McDermott will
rely on the following representations in delivering the Tax Opinion and (ii)
the Tax Opinion may not accurately describe the consequences of the Merger if
any of the following representations are not accurate in all respects as of
the Closing, Maple Parent hereby represents and certifies after due inquiry
and investigation that (1) to the extent the following representations relate
to Maple Parent, such representations are true, correct and complete in all
respects as of the date hereof and will continue to be true, correct and
complete in all respects at all times up to and including the Effective Time,
and (2) to the extent the following representations relate to DPSG and Merger
Sub, Maple Parent believes such representations are true, correct and complete
in all respects as of the date hereof and will continue to be true, correct
and complete in all respects at all times up to and including the Effective
Time:

 



 

1. Determination of the consideration to be issued in the Merger to the shareholders of Maple Parent was the result of an arms-length negotiation between the managements of DPSG and Maple Parent. The fair market value of the DPSG Common Stock to be received by each shareholder of Maple Parent will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the outstanding common stock of Maple Parent (" _Maple Parent Common Stock_ ") surrendered by such shareholder in the Merger.

  (1) References to the Merger Agreement contained in this "Tax Representation
Letter" include, unless the context otherwise requires, each document attached
thereto as an exhibit or annex. All capitalized terms used herein and not
otherwise defined have the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

2. In connection with the Merger, no Maple Parent Common Stock will be acquired by DPSG, any Person related to DPSG (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(4)) (a " _DPSG Related Person_ ") or any Person acting as agent or intermediary for any of them for any consideration other than DPSG Common Stock and, where applicable, cash in lieu of fractional share interests.

 



 

3. In the Merger, all of the shares of Maple Parent Common Stock will be exchanged solely for DPSG Common Stock. At the time of the Merger, Maple Parent will not have outstanding any warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which any Person could acquire stock in Maple Parent, or, following the Merger, stock in DPSG that, if exercised or converted, would affect DPSGs acquisition or retention of 100% ownership of Maple Parent. Further, no liabilities of Maple Parent or of the holders of Maple Parent Common Stock immediately prior to the Merger (the " _Maple Parent Shareholders_ ") will be assumed by DPSG, nor, to the best knowledge of the management of Maple Parent, will any Maple Parent Common Stock be subject to any liabilities.

 



 

4. Following the Merger, DPSG will cause Maple Parent to hold within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(j)(3)(iii) at least 90% of the fair market value of its net assets and at least 70% of the fair market value of its gross assets held immediately prior to the Merger (in each case, for the avoidance of doubt, without regard to cash of Maple Parent acquired pursuant to the Maple Parent Restructuring that is distributed in transfers described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(k)) and at least 90% of the fair market value of the net assets, and at least 70% of the fair market value of the gross assets, of Merger Sub held immediately prior to the Merger. For purposes of this representation, amounts paid by Maple Parent or Merger Sub to the Maple Parent Shareholders who receive cash or other property, amounts used by Maple Parent or Merger Sub to pay reorganization expenses and all redemptions and distributions (except for regular, normal dividends to the Maple Parent Shareholders) made by Maple Parent will be included as assets of Maple Parent or Merger Sub, respectively, immediately prior to the Merger.

 



 

5. Following the Merger, DPSG will continue, or cause to be continued, Maple Parents historic business or use, or cause to be used, a significant portion of Maple Parents historic business assets in a business either directly or through one or more members of DPSGs qualified group (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)) or one or more partnerships in which DPSG and members of its qualified group own an aggregate interest representing a significant interest in such business or have active and substantial management functions as partners in such business (each within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(iii)(B)).

 



 

6. DPSG has no plan or intention to (a) cause Maple Parent (i) to liquidate, (ii) to merge with or into another corporation (or to convert Maple Parent into a

 



      
 

 



 

"disregarded entity" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
301.7701-3) after the Effective Time or (iii) to sell, distribute or otherwise
dispose of any of its assets or the assets of Merger Sub (other than
dispositions made in the ordinary course of business or described in Section
368(a)(2)(C) or Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(k)); or (b) sell or
otherwise dispose of the stock of Maple Parent (or cause such sale or
disposition), _provided_ that, in the case of any disposition described in
Section 368(a)(2)(C) or Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(k), the foregoing
representations in this Representation #6 shall apply to any transferee that
is a member of DPSGs qualified group (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)).

 



 

7. Except pursuant to share repurchases that are made on the open market, through a broker at the then-prevailing market price pursuant to a stock repurchase program described in Revenue Ruling 99-58, 1999-2 C.B. 701, there is no plan or intention in connection with the Merger, for DPSG, any DPSG Related Person or any Person acting as agent or intermediary for any of them to purchase, exchange, redeem or otherwise acquire (directly or indirectly and including by derivative transactions such as an equity swap which would have the economic effect of a transfer of ownership) any DPSG Common Stock issued to holders of Maple Parent Common Stock in the Merger, including, for example, in transactions that would reduce the ownership of the Maple Parent Shareholders of DPSG Common Stock issued in the Merger to a number of shares having an aggregate fair market value, as of the Effective Time, of less than 40% of the total fair market value of all of the shares of Maple Parent Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

8. Except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement or any agreement or document described therein (collectively, the " _Transaction Documents_ "), each of Maple Parent and, to the best knowledge of the management of Maple Parent, the Maple Parent Shareholders, DPSG, DPSGs shareholders and Merger Sub will pay its respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger. All expenses of the Maple Parent Shareholders, determined as of immediately before the Merger, that are paid by DPSG, if any, will be "solely and directly related" (within the meaning of Revenue Ruling 73-54, 1973-1 C.B. 187) to the Merger.

 



 

9. Neither DPSG nor Merger Sub is an investment company as defined in Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code or under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code.

 



 

10. At the Effective Time of the Merger, DPSG will own all of the issued and outstanding stock Merger Sub. Prior to the Merger, Merger Sub will not have outstanding any warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which any Person could acquire stock in Merger Sub, or, following the Merger, stock in Maple Parent that, if exercised or converted, would affect DPSGs acquisition or retention of 100% ownership of Maple Parent. Merger Sub was formed by DPSG solely for the purpose of engaging in the Merger and has not, since its formation, owned any assets, other than assets with

 



      
 

 



 

nominal value, incurred any indebtedness for money borrowed, issued stock or
any other equity to any Person other than DPSG, or engaged in any trade or
business activities or operations (other than entering into the Merger
Agreement or executing any Transaction Document).

 



 

11. DPSG has no plan or intention to cause or permit Maple Parent to alter the terms of the Maple Parent Common Stock, to issue additional shares of Maple Parent stock or to grant any warrants, options, convertible securities or any other type of right pursuant to which any Person could acquire stock of Maple Parent that, if exercised or converted, would result in DPSG not having 100% ownership of Maple Parent.

 



 

12. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between DPSG and Maple Parent or between Merger Sub and Maple Parent.

 



 

13. Merger Sub will have no liabilities assumed by Maple Parent, and will not transfer to Maple Parent any assets subject to liabilities, in the Merger.

 



 

14. None of the compensation to be received by any shareholder-employee of Maple Parent will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any of such Persons shares of Maple Parent Common Stock; none of the shares of DPSG Common Stock to be received by any shareholder-employee of Maple Parent in the Merger will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any past or future services; and the compensation to be paid to any shareholder-employee after the Merger will be for services actually rendered and will be commensurate with amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arms-length for similar services.

 



 

15. The Merger is being effected for bona fide business reasons, as described in the Form 8-K, Current Report, of DPSG filed on January 29, 2018 (with the Transaction Documents, collectively, the " _Project Sea Salt Documents_ ").

 



 

16. The information relating to the Merger and all related transactions (including, but not limited to, all representations, warranties, covenants and undertakings) set forth in the Project Sea Salt Documents, insofar as such information relates to Maple Parent or the plans or intentions of Maple Parent set forth in the Project Sea Salt Documents are true, correct and complete in all material respects.

 



 

17. The Transaction Documents (including all exhibits and attachments thereto) represent the full and complete agreement between DPSG, Merger Sub, and Maple Parent regarding the Merger, and there are no other written or oral agreements regarding the Merger between Maple Parent, on the one hand, and DPSG and/or Merger Sub, on the other. The Merger will be consummated pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, and none of the material terms and conditions thereof has been or will be waived or modified.

 



 

18. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of DPSG Common Stock in the Merger is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to DPSG of issuing fractional shares, if any, and does not represent separately

 



      
 

 



 

bargained-for consideration, and the total cash consideration that will be
paid to the shareholders of Maple Parent in lieu of fractional shares of DPSG
Common Stock will represent less than 1 percent of the total value of the
consideration to be issued in the Merger to the Maple Parent Shareholders. The
fractional share interests of each Maple Parent Shareholder will be
aggregated, and no Maple Parent Shareholder will receive cash in an amount
equal to or greater than the value of one full share of DPSG Common Stock.

 



 

19. DPSG Common Stock entitles the holder to vote for the election and the removal of the board of directors of DPSG.

 



 

20. Following the Merger, DPSG will comply, and will cause Maple Parent to comply, with the record-keeping and information filing requirements of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.351-3 and 1.368-3.

 



 

21. DPSG will not take any position on any federal, state or local income or franchise Tax Return, or take any other tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and an exchange described in Section 351(a) of the Code.

 



 

22. None of the stock of Maple Parent to be transferred in connection with the Merger is "section 306 stock" within the meaning of section 306(c).

 



 

23. The Maple Parent Shareholders will not retain any rights in the Maple Parent Common Stock transferred to Sea Salt pursuant to the Merger.

 



 

24. There will be no indebtedness created in favor of the Maple Parent Shareholders as a result of the Merger.

 



 

25. There is no plan or intention on the part of DPSG to redeem or otherwise reacquire any DPSG stock issued to the Maple Parent Shareholders pursuant with the Merger.

 



 

26. The transfer of the property to DPSG in the Merger will occur pursuant to a plan agreed upon before the Merger in which the rights of the parties are defined.

 



 

27. Taking into account any issuance of additional DPSG stock; any issuance of DPSG stock for services; the exercise of any stock rights, warrants, or subscriptions; and the sale, exchange, transfer by gift, or other disposition of any of the stock in DPSG received in the Merger, the Maple Parent Shareholders will be in "control" of DPSG within the meaning of section 368(c) immediately after the Merger.

 



 

28. DPSG will not be an investment company within the meaning of section 351(e)(1) and Treasury Regulations Section 1.351-1(c)(1)(ii). Specifically, at the time of the Merger, DPSG will not be regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, or a corporation more than 80 percent of the assets of which are

 



      
 

 



 

stock or securities held for investment or are interests in regulated
investment companies or real estate investment trusts.

 



 

29. The aggregate fair market value of the Maple Parent Common Stock that will be transferred by the Maple Parent Shareholders to DPSG will equal or exceed the aggregate adjusted basis of such stock immediately after the Merger.

 



 

30. The total fair market value of the Maple Parent Common Stock that will be transferred by the Maple Parent Shareholders to DPSG pursuant to the Merger will exceed zero. The fair market value of the assets of DPSG will exceed the amount of its liabilities immediately after the Merger.

 



 

31. At the time of the Merger, no Maple Parent Shareholder will be under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar case (within the meaning of section 368(a)(3)(A)), and the stock or securities received in the exchange will not be used to satisfy indebtedness of any Maple Parent Shareholder.

 



 

32. At the time of the Merger, DPSG will not be a "personal service corporation" within the meaning of section 269A.

 



 

33. The Merger is not the result of the solicitation by a promoter, broker or investment house.

 



 

34. No stock of DPSG or of Merger Sub will be placed in escrow or issued under a contingent stock arrangement.

 



 

35. To the best knowledge of Maple Parent, no Maple Parent Shareholder will own any stock of DPSG at the time the Special Dividend is declared and, consequently, no portion of the Special Dividend will be paid to any Maple Parent Shareholder.

 



 

36. The individual executing this letter is authorized to make all of the representations set forth herein on behalf of Maple Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

We understand that McDermott will rely, without further inquiry, on this
representation letter in rendering its opinion as to certain U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the Merger. We will promptly and timely inform you
if, after signing this representation letter, we have reason to believe that

McDermott Will and Emery LLP

 

500 North Capitol Street, N.W.

 

Washington, D.C. 20001

 



 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



 

In connection with the opinion (the " _Tax Opinion_ ") to be delivered by
McDermott Will and Emery LLP, an Illinois limited liability partnership ("
_McDermott_ "), pursuant to Section 8.02(c) of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") dated as of January 29, 2018 among Dr
Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("DPSG"), Salt Merger Sub,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Maple Parent Holdings
Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Maple Parent"_ ), the undersigned, officers
of DPSG and Merger Sub, respectively, are making representations in this
letter on behalf of DPSG and Merger Sub, respectively. Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement,(1) Merger Sub will merge with and into Maple Parent with Maple
Parent surviving as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of DPSG (the " _Merger_
"). Recognizing that (i) McDermott will rely on the following representations
in delivering the Tax Opinion and (ii) the Tax Opinion may not accurately
describe the consequences of the Merger if any of the following
representations are not accurate in all respects as of the Closing, DPSG and
Merger Sub hereby represent and certify after due inquiry and investigation
that (1) to the extent the following representations relate to DPSG and Merger
Sub, such representations are true, correct and complete in all respects as of
the date hereof and will continue to be true, correct and complete in all
respects at all times up to and including the Effective Time, and (2) to the
extent the following representations relate to Maple Parent, DPSG and Merger
Sub each believes such representations are true, correct and complete in all
respects as of the date hereof and will continue to be true, correct and
complete in all respects at all times up to and including the Effective Time:

 



 

1. Determination of the consideration to be issued in the Merger to the shareholders of Maple Parent was the result of an arms-length negotiation between the managements of DPSG and Maple Parent. The fair market value of the DPSG Common Stock to be received by each shareholder of Maple Parent will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the outstanding common stock of

  (1) References to the Merger Agreement contained in this "Tax Representation
Letter" include, unless the context otherwise requires, each document attached

Maple Parent (" _Maple Parent Common Stock_ ") surrendered by such shareholder
in the Merger.

 



 

2. In connection with the Merger, no Maple Parent Common Stock will be acquired by DPSG, any Person related to DPSG (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(4)) (an " _DPSG Related Person_ ") or any Person acting as agent or intermediary for any of them for any consideration other than DPSG Common Stock and, where applicable, cash in lieu of fractional share interests.

 



 

3. In the Merger, all of the shares of Maple Parent Common Stock will be exchanged solely for DPSG Common Stock. At the time of the Merger, Maple Parent will not have outstanding any warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which any Person could acquire stock in Maple Parent, or, following the Merger, stock in DPSG that, if exercised or converted, would affect DPSGs acquisition or retention of 100% ownership of Maple Parent. Further, no liabilities of Maple Parent or of the holders of Maple Parent Common Stock immediately prior to the Merger (the " _Maple Parent Shareholders_ ") will be assumed by DPSG, nor, to the best knowledge of the management of DPSG and Merger Sub, will any Maple Parent Common Stock be subject to any liabilities.

 



 

4. Following the Merger, DPSG will cause Maple Parent to hold within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(j)(3)(iii) at least 90% of the fair market value of its net assets and at least 70% of the fair market value of its gross assets held immediately prior to the Merger (in each case, for the avoidance of doubt, without regard to cash of Maple Parent acquired pursuant to the Maple Parent Restructuring that is distributed in transfers described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(k)) and at least 90% of the fair market value of the net assets, and at least 70% of the fair market value of the gross assets, of Merger Sub held immediately prior to the Merger. For purposes of this representation, amounts paid by Maple Parent or Merger Sub to the Maple Parent Shareholders who receive cash or other property, amounts used by Maple Parent or Merger Sub to pay reorganization expenses and all redemptions and distributions (except for regular, normal dividends to the Maple Parent Shareholders) made by Maple Parent will be included as assets of Maple Parent or Merger Sub, respectively, immediately prior to the Merger.

 



 

5. Following the Merger, DPSG will continue, or cause to be continued, Maple Parents historic business or use, or cause to be used, a significant portion of Maple Parents historic business assets in a business either directly or through one or more members of DPSGs qualified group (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)) or one or more partnerships in which DPSG and members of its qualified group own an aggregate interest representing a significant interest in such business or have active and substantial management functions as partners in such business (each within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(iii)(B)).

Except pursuant to share repurchases that are made on the open market, through a broker at the then-prevailing market price pursuant to a stock repurchase program described in Revenue Ruling 99-58, 1999-2 C.B. 701, there is no plan or intention in connection with the Merger, for DPSG, any DPSG Related Person or any Person acting as agent or intermediary for any of them to purchase, exchange, redeem or otherwise acquire (directly or indirectly and including by derivative transactions such as an equity swap which would have the economic effect of a transfer of ownership) any DPSG Common Stock issued to holders of Maple Parent Common Stock in the Merger, including, for example, in transactions that would reduce the ownership of the Maple Parent Shareholders of DPSG Common Stock issued in the Merger to a number of shares having an aggregate fair market value, as of the Effective Time, of less than 40% of the total fair market value of all of the shares of Maple Parent Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

8.

Merger Sub was formed by DPSG solely for the purpose of engaging in the Merger
and has not, since its formation, owned any assets, other than assets with
nominal value, incurred any indebtedness for money borrowed, issued stock or
any other equity to any Person other than DPSG, or engaged in any trade or
business activities or operations (other than entering into the Merger
Agreement or executing any Transaction Document).
