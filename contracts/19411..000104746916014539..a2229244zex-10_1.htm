conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer agrees to
purchase from each Seller and each Seller agrees to sell to Buyer, all of the
Shares held by such Seller at the Closing, as set forth in the Final Closing
Letter, free and clear of all Liens (other than those described in _Schedule
3.3_ of the Company Disclosure Letter).

 



 

Section 2.2. _Purchase Price; Closing Estimate_.

 



 

(a) The purchase price (the " ** _Purchase Price_** ") for the purchase
and sale described in _Section 2.1_ shall be, subject to _Section 2.7_, an
amount in cash equal to: (i) $127,500,000 (the " ** _Base Purchase Price_**

and owing to the Sellers pursuant to _Section 2.7_. Buyer shall not fund any

foregoing sentence shall not apply to any Holdback Amount or Extension Amount

(b) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare in good faith and deliver to Buyer a statement (the " **

accordance with the Accounting Principles, setting forth its estimates of (i)
the amount of Closing Cash, (ii) the Closing Indebtedness, (iii) the Closing
Working Capital (the " ** _Estimated Working Capital_** "), (iv) the amount,
if any, by which the Target Working Capital differs from the Estimated Working
Capital, which amount will either be a positive number (if the Estimated

the Estimated Working Capital is less than the Target Working Capital) (the "
** _Estimated Working Capital Adjustment_** "), (v) the Company Transaction
Expenses (the " ** _Estimated Company Transaction Expenses_** ") and (vi) the
Companys calculation of the Purchase Price based thereon (the " ** _Estimated
Purchase Price_** "). The Company shall make its Representatives reasonably
available to Buyer during the three (3) Business Days referenced in the first

Section 2.3. _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been abandoned pursuant to
_Article VIII_, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_, the closing of the Transactions (the "
** _Closing_** ") shall take place at the offices of Milbank, 28 Liberty
Street,

 



      
 

 



 

New York, New York 10005, or by telephonic or electronic delivery or release

7.2(f)_ are satisfied or waived, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
the other conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (the third (3rd) Business Day
after the date of such satisfaction of such conditions, the " ** _Satisfaction
Date_** ") or (b) such other date, time or place as the parties hereto shall
agree in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, at Buyers option,
by written notice delivered to the Shareholders Representative on or prior to
the Business Day immediately preceding the Satisfaction Date, Buyer may elect
to cause the Closing to occur not on the Satisfaction Date but on the first

Satisfaction Date occurs. The date on which the Closing is held pursuant to
this _Section 2.3_ is herein referred to as the " ** _Closing Date_** ". All
actions listed in _Section 2.4_ or _2.5_ that occur on the Closing Date shall
be deemed to occur simultaneously at the Closing. The Closing will be
effective as of 12:00:01 A.M. Eastern Prevailing Time on the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 2.4. _Closing Deliveries to Buyer_. At the Closing, (a) the
Company shall deliver, or shall cause to be delivered, to Buyer, to the extent
required pursuant to _Section 4.24(a)_, an amended _Schedule 4.24(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, (b) the Shareholders Representative shall deliver,
or shall cause to be delivered, to Buyer a counterpart duly executed by each
of the Sellers, the Shareholders Representative, the directors, officers and
certain employees of the Company, as applicable, of each Ancillary Agreement
and the other documents and instruments to be executed and delivered at the
Closing to which any of such Persons is a party and (c) each Seller shall
deliver, or shall cause to be delivered, to Buyer all duly issued and
authorized share certificates of the Company and a stock power form evidencing
the transfer thereof.

 



 

Section 2.5. _Closing Deliveries by Buyer to Sellers_. At the Closing,
the Buyer shall:

 



 

(a) pay to each Seller, by wire transfers of immediately available funds
to such account or accounts as designated by the Shareholders Representative
or the applicable Seller at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Estimated
Closing Payment Per Share and (ii) the number of Shares held by such Seller at
the Closing, as set forth in the Final Closing Letter;

 



 

(b) cause a wire transfer of immediately available funds to be made to
such account as designated by the Escrow Agent at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, in an amount equal to the Escrow Amount, such
amount, together with all interest and income thereon resulting from
investments of such amounts in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, to constitute the escrow fund (the " ** _Escrow Fund_** "). The
Escrow Fund shall be governed by the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this
Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall be held in escrow and shall be released in
accordance with _Section 2.6(f)_ and _2.8(a)_ , _Article IX_ and the Escrow
Agreement;

 



 

(c) cause a wire transfer of immediately available funds to be made to
such account as designated by the Shareholders Representative at least two
(2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, in an amount equal to the Expense
Holdback Amount. The Expense Holdback

 



      
 

 



 

Amount shall be held in escrow by the Shareholders Representative and shall
be released in accordance with _Section 2.8(b)_;

 



 

(d) subject to the receipt of customary payoff letters, to the extent

thereof;

 



 

(e) to the extent the Company has not previously made such payment on or
prior to the Closing, cause wire transfers of immediately available funds to

(f) deliver to the Shareholders Representative a counterpart duly
executed by Buyer of each Ancillary Agreement to which Buyer is a party.

 



 

Section 2.6. _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) _Initial Statement_. As promptly as practicable, but in no event
later than one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall prepare in good faith and deliver, or cause to be prepared in good
faith and delivered, to the Shareholders Representative a written statement
(the " ** _Initial Statement_** "), which statement shall be prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Principles, setting forth Buyers calculation
of each of the: (i) Closing Cash, (ii) Closing Indebtedness, (iii) Closing
Working Capital, (iv) amount, if any, by which the Target Working Capital
differs from the Closing Working Capital, (v) Company Transaction Expenses and
(vi) Buyers calculation of the Purchase Price based thereon, together with
reasonably detailed supporting documentation.

 



 

(b) _Review and Dispute of Initial Statement_. Following the delivery
of the Initial Statement, Buyer agrees to provide, or cause its employees (and
the employees of the Company) to provide, the Shareholders Representative and
its Representatives with reasonable access to Buyers and its Representatives
working papers and any working papers of Buyers independent accountants
related to the preparation of the Initial Statement (subject to execution of a
customary independent accountant access letter, if requested by Buyers
independent accountants with respect to such work papers), as well as to books
and records and other relevant information of the Company, and Buyer shall
make reasonably available its or the Companys employees, if any, directly
responsible for and knowledgeable about the information used in, and the
preparation of the Initial Statement. The Shareholders Representative may
dispute the Initial Statement by delivery of written notice thereof to the
Buyer (a " ** _Dispute Notice_** ") within thirty (30) calendar days following
the receipt by the Shareholders Representative of the Initial Statement. The
Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail all items disputed by the
Shareholders Representative, the basis for such dispute, the amounts involved
and the Shareholders Representatives proposed changes thereto, with
reasonably detailed supporting

 



      
 

 



 

documentation. If (i) by written notice to Buyer, the Shareholders
Representative accepts the Initial Statement or (ii) the Shareholders
Representative fails to deliver a Dispute Notice within the prescribed thirty
(30) calendar day period (which failure shall result in the Shareholders
Representative being deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Initial
Statement delivered by Buyer), the Initial Statement delivered by Buyer shall
become final and binding on the Sellers as of the date on which the earlier of
the foregoing events occurs. If a Dispute Notice is timely delivered to
Buyer, then the Shareholders Representative and Buyer shall, during the
thirty (30) calendar days immediately following receipt of the Dispute Notice
by Buyer (the " ** _Resolution Period_** "), cooperate and negotiate in good
faith to resolve their differences with respect to the Initial Statement or
any element thereof. Any resolution by the Shareholders Representative and
Buyer during the Resolution Period as to any disputed amounts will be final,
binding and conclusive.

 



 

(c) _Dispute Resolution_. If the Shareholders Representative and
Buyer do not resolve all disputed items on the Initial Statement by the end of
the Resolution Period, the Shareholders Representative and Buyer shall submit
all items remaining in dispute with respect to the Dispute Notice (along with
a copy of the Initial Statement marked to indicate those line items which are
in dispute, including each partys proposed determination of such amounts (the
" ** _Buyer s Submission_**" and the " ** _Shareholders  Representatives
Submission,_**" as the case may be) and reasonably detailed supporting
documentation) within thirty (30) calendar days after the expiration of the
Resolution Period to KPMG LLP (or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act,
another internationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall
be agreed upon in writing by the Shareholders Representative and Buyer, or,
if such parties cannot agree, as selected by the American Arbitration
Association) (the " ** _Neutral Auditor_** ") for resolution. The Neutral
Auditor shall act as an expert and not an arbitrator and shall determine only
those items in dispute. Each party shall (i) cooperate with the Neutral
Auditor, (ii) have the opportunity to make presentations and provide
supporting material to the Neutral Auditor in defense of their positions and
(iii) subject to customary confidentiality and indemnity agreements, provide
the Neutral Auditor with access to their respective books, records, personnel
and Representatives and such other information as the Neutral Auditor may
require in order to render its determination. The Neutral Auditor will
deliver to the Shareholders Representative and Buyer a written determination
(such determination to include a worksheet setting forth all material
calculations used in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on
information provided to the Neutral Auditor by the Shareholders
Representative and Buyer) of the disputed items within forty-five (45)
calendar days of receipt of the disputed items, which determination will be
final, binding and conclusive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Neutral
Auditor shall not be permitted or authorized to determine an amount with
respect to any disputed item that is outside of the range between the amounts
of such disputed item as proposed by the Shareholders Representative in the
Shareholders Representatives Submission, on the one hand, and Buyer in the
Buyers Submission, on the other hand. All fees and expenses relating to the
work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditor will be allocated between
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Shareholders Representative, on the other
hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed items
so submitted to the Neutral Auditor that is unsuccessfully disputed by each
such party (as finally determined by the Neutral Auditor) bears to the total
disputed amount of such items so submitted. For the avoidance of doubt and
solely as an illustration of the methodology set forth in the preceding
sentence, if (i) the Shareholders Representatives Submission delivered by
the Shareholders Representative assigns values to the disputed items

 



      
 

 



 

such that the aggregate Purchase Price set forth in the Initial Statement
would be increased by $1,000,000, (ii) the Buyers Submission maintains that
the Purchase Price set forth in the Initial Statement is correct and (iii) the
Neutral Auditors final resolution of the disputed items in accordance with
this _Section 2.6(c)_ is that the Purchase Price is increased from the amount
set forth in the Buyers Submission by $600,000 (i.e., sixty percent (60%) of
the amount in dispute is resolved in favor of the Shareholders
Representative), then the Shareholders Representative shall be responsible
for 40% of such fees and expenses of the Neutral Auditor and Buyer shall be
responsible for 60% of such fees and expenses of the Neutral Auditor. In the
event that either the Shareholders Representative or Buyer fail to submit a
statement regarding any items remaining in dispute within the time determined
by the Neutral Auditor, then the Neutral Auditor shall render a decision based
solely on the evidence timely submitted to the Neutral Auditor by the
Shareholders Representative (which shall constitute the Shareholders
Representatives Submission) and Buyer (which shall constitute the Buyers
Submission). The final, binding and conclusive statement of Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital and Company Transaction Expenses
which either are (i) undisputed, (ii) finally agreed upon by the Shareholders
Representative and Buyer in accordance with _Section 2.6(b)_ or (iii)
delivered by the Neutral Auditor in accordance with this _Section 2.6(c)_,
will be the " ** _Conclusive Statement_** ", respectively. The date on which
the Shareholders Representative and Buyer agree to, or the Neutral Auditor
delivers, the Conclusive Statement shall be the " ** _Conclusive Date_** ".

 



 

(d) _Conclusive Purchase Price_. The final Purchase Price to be paid
by Buyer in respect of the Transactions after taking into account all
adjustments pursuant to this _Section 2.6(d)_ (the " ** _Conclusive Purchase
Price_** ") shall be, subject to _Section 2.7_, an amount in cash equal to:
(i) the Base Purchase Price, (ii) _plus_ the Conclusive Cash, if any, (iii)
_minus_ the Conclusive Closing Indebtedness, (iv) _plus_ the amount by which
the Closing Working Capital set forth in the Conclusive Statement exceeds the
Target Working Capital or _minus_ the amount by which the Target Working
Capital exceeds the Closing Working Capital set forth in the Conclusive
Statement, (v) _minus_ the Escrow Amount, (vi) _minus_ the Expense Holdback
Amount and (vii) _minus_ the Conclusive Company Transaction Expenses.

 



 

(e) _Adjustment Amount_. The " ** _Adjustment Amount_** " shall be the
difference, if any, between the Conclusive Purchase Price and the Estimated
Purchase Price. The Adjustment Amount (if any) shall be (i) the " **
_Additional Purchase Price_** " if the Conclusive Purchase Price is more than
the Estimated Purchase Price or (ii) the " ** _Excess Amount_** " if the
Conclusive Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price.

 



 

(f) _Post-Closing Payments_.

 



 

(i) If the Additional Purchase Price is determined to be due in
accordance with this _Section 2.6_, then, within five (5) Business Days after
the Conclusive Date, Buyer shall promptly pay to each Seller, by wire
transfers of immediately available funds to such account or accounts as
designated by the Shareholders Representative or the applicable Seller at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the date of such payment, an amount equal
to such Sellers Payout Percentage of the Additional Purchase Price.

 



 

(ii) If there is an Excess Amount determined to be due in accordance
with this _Section 2.6_, then, within five (5) Business Days after the
Conclusive Date, the parties

 



      
 

 



 

shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver
promptly from the Escrow Fund by wire transfer to Buyer, the Excess Amount.
If the Excess Amount exceeds the Escrow Amount, then within such five (5)
Business Day-period, each Seller shall pay to Buyer by wire transfer an amount
equal to such Sellers Payout Percentage of such excess.

 



 

(iii) All amounts, if any, payable to the Sellers pursuant to this
_Section 2.6(f)_ shall be paid in cash, without interest, and the aggregate
amount of all such payments shall be referred to in this Agreement as the " **
_Post-Closing Payment_** ".

 



 

Section 2.7. _Holdback Payment_.

 



 

(a) If the Company or any of its Affiliates is confirmed as a successful
bidder and is awarded the Retention Contract, then an amount (if greater than
zero) equal to the Holdback Amount minus the aggregate Extension Amounts paid
by Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_ shall be due and payable within five
(5) Business Days of Buyers receipt of such confirmation in writing and a
copy of the written definitive Retention Contract executed and delivered by
both the Company (or its Affiliate) and the applicable Governmental Entity;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if there is a bid protest challenge to the award
of the Retention Contract, such payment shall not become due and payable until
the resolution of such challenge and the reconfirmation of the Retention
Contract award.

 



 

(b) In the event that the ordering period under the Current Holdback
Contract is extended from time to time after the date of this Agreement, then
an Extension Amount shall be due and payable within five (5) Business Days of
Buyers receipt of such confirmation in writing. An Extension Amount shall be
due and payable upon each extension of the Current Holdback Contract from the
date hereof until the aggregate of such payments shall equal $10,000,000.

 



 

(c) If the Holdback Amount or Extension Amount is due in accordance with
_Section 2.7(a)_ or _(b)_ , then Buyer shall pay to each Seller by wire
transfers of immediately available funds to such account or accounts as
designated by the Shareholders Representative or the applicable Seller at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the date on which such payment is
required to be made, an amount equal to such Sellers Payout Percentage of the
Holdback Amount or Extension Amount, as applicable.

 



 

(d) Subsequent to the Closing, Buyer and the Company shall not, directly
or indirectly, take any actions that would have the purpose of avoiding,
reducing or frustrating the achievement of conditions that would trigger
payment of the Holdback Amount or Extension Amount, as applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, from the Closing until the date on which the
Retention Contract is awarded to a Person other than the Company or any of its
Affiliates (after expiration or termination of any protests thereof) Buyer
shall cause the Company to operate, and the Company shall operate, in the
ordinary course in a manner consistent with the Companys past practices
including (i) making available the services of personnel similarly experienced
and qualified to pursue the Retention Contract and (ii) bidding on the
Retention Contract on terms that are consistent with the Companys past
practices.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.8. _Remainder Payments_.

 



 

(a) _Release and Payment of Escrow Amount Remainder_. The Escrow
Agreement shall specify that any amounts remaining in the Escrow Fund after
giving effect to all payments made pursuant to _Section 2.6(f)_, and _Article
IX_ (the " ** _Escrow Release Amount_** ") shall be released to Sellers on the
Escrow Release Date by wire transfers of immediately available funds to such
account or accounts as designated by the Shareholders Representative or the
applicable Seller at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date of such
payment, in an amount equal to such Sellers Payout Percentage of the Escrow
Release Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any claim for indemnification
by any Indemnified Party under _Article IX_ shall have been properly asserted
by Buyer in accordance with this Agreement on or prior to the Survival
Expiration Date that remains pending on the Escrow Release Date (such claims,
the " ** _Pending Claims_** "), (i) the Escrow Release Amount released to the
Sellers on the Escrow Release Date shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of
all such Pending Claims (as set forth in the Claim Notice or Indemnity Notice
in respect of each such Pending Claim) and (ii) any amounts remaining in the
Escrow Fund following the Escrow Release Date in respect of any such Pending
Claim shall be released to Sellers promptly upon resolution or (if applicable)
satisfaction of such Pending Claim.

Promptly following the latest to occur of (i) the settlement of all disputes
in connection with the defense or settlement of indemnification claims made
under _Article IX_, (ii) the expiration of the time period during which any
party is entitled to bring a claim for indemnification under _Article IX_ and
the settlement of all indemnification claims timely made in accordance
therewith and (iii) such time as the Shareholders Representative reasonably
believes that no matters or disputes with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby remain or could arise which would require the
Shareholders Representative to act in its capacity as such, the Shareholders
Representative shall release to the Sellers any remaining amounts in respect
of the Expense Holdback Amount (the " ** _Remaining Expense Holdback
Balance_** "). The Shareholders Representative shall promptly pay to each
Seller (without interest), by wire transfers of immediately available funds to
such account or accounts as designated by such Seller at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the date of such payment, an amount equal to such
Sellers Payout Percentage of the Remaining Expense Holdback Balance.

Except as set forth in the letter (the " ** _Company Disclosure Letter_** ")

concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (it being understood and
agreed that references herein to a "Schedule" thereto shall constitute
references to the particular schedule; _provided_ that the disclosures in any
schedule shall qualify other sections or subsections of _Article III_ or
_Article IV_ to the extent a cross-reference to the applicable schedule is
included therein or its applicability to such other section or subsection is
readily apparent), each Seller, as to itself, severally and not jointly,
hereby represents and warrants as of the date hereof (unless another date is
specified, in which case, then as of such specified date) to Buyer and
Ultimate Parent as follows:

delivery by such Seller of this Agreement and the consummation by such Seller
of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized and approved
by such Seller. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such
Seller and, assuming that this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding

Section 3.2. _Conflicts; Consents_.

 



 

(a) _Conflicts_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.2(a)_ of the

such Seller, and the consummation by such Seller of the transactions
contemplated hereby, will not (i) conflict with or result in a violation or
breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of such Sellers trust
agreement, if applicable, or (ii) conflict with, or result in any material
violation of or default under (or any event that, with notice or lapse of time
or both, would constitute a material default under), or give rise to a right
of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a

entitlement to increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed payments to
any Person under, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon
such Seller or the Shares owned by such Seller or any other assets and
properties of such Seller, pursuant to any provision of any Contract to which
such Seller is a party or by which such Seller or the Shares owned by such
Seller may be bound (each, a " ** _Seller Contract_** "), or any Order or Law

Section 6.14. _Conflicts; Privileges_. It is acknowledged by each of the
parties hereto that the Company has retained Milbank to act as counsel to the
Company and the Sellers in connection with the Transactions and that Milbank
has not acted as counsel for any other Person in connection with the
Transactions and that no other party to this Agreement has the status of a
client of Milbank for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result
thereof. Buyer hereby agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises
subsequent to the Closing between Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Company), on the one hand, and any Seller or any of
their Affiliates (including the Shareholders Representative, on their behalf
and, prior to the Closing, the Company), on the other hand, Milbank may
represent such Seller or any such Affiliate (including the Shareholders
Representative) in such dispute even though the interests of such Seller or
such Affiliate may be directly adverse to Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company), and even though Milbank may have
represented the Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or
may be handling ongoing matters

 



      
 

 



 

for Buyer or for the Company, Buyer and the Company hereby (i) waive, on
behalf of themselves and each of their Affiliates, any claim they have or may
have that Milbank has a conflict of interest in connection with or is
otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation, (ii) agree that, in
the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company) on the one hand and any
Seller or the Shareholders Representative on the other hand, Milbank may
represent any such party in such dispute even though the interest of such
party may be directly adverse to Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Company), and even though Milbank may have represented
the Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be
handling ongoing matters for Buyer or for the Company. Buyer further agrees
that, as to all communications among Milbank, the Company, any Seller and/or
the Shareholders Representative that relate in any way to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege, the expectation
of client confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary privilege belong
to such Seller and/or the Shareholders Representative and may be controlled
by such Seller and/or the Shareholders Representative and shall not pass to
or be claimed by Buyer or the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a
dispute arises between Buyer or the Company and a third party other than a
party to this Agreement after the Closing, the Company may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communication
by Milbank to such third party. Buyer agrees to take, and to cause its
Affiliates to take, all steps necessary to implement the intent of this
_Section 6.14_. The Sellers, Buyer, the Company and the Shareholders
Representative further agree that Milbank and its respective partners and
employees are third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.14_.

 



 

Section 6.15. _Repayment of Indebtedness_. At the Closing, subject to the
receipt of customary "payoff letters" and instructions, Buyer shall have
provided for the repayment of all borrowings under the Credit Agreement
outstanding (after giving effect to any prepayments by the Company made in
connection with, and conditioned on, the Closing) immediately prior to, or as
of, the Closing Date, the payment of all other amounts then due and payable
thereunder and the termination of the Credit Agreement and all related Liens.

 



 

Section 6.16. _Security Clearances_. Buyer hereby acknowledges and
agrees that the nature of the business of the Company requires compliance with
the Department of Defense National Industrial Security Program (" ** _NISP_**
") and National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (Department of
Defense Regulation 5220.22-M, with applicable changes) (" ** _NISPOM_** "),
and all other United States Government industrial security regulations
(collectively, the " ** _Industrial Security Regulations_** "), which, inter
alia, obligate the Company to obtain facility security clearances, limit the
degree of foreign ownership or control of, or foreign influence over, the
Company, require recertification by the Company regarding the degree of
foreign ownership, influence and control to which the Company is subject that
results from a change in ownership of the Company, require that certain
officers and management personnel and members of the Board obtain Department
of Defense personnel security clearances and Sensitive Compartmented
Information clearance caveats (an " ** _SCI Caveat_** "), as necessary, in
order to gain access to certain information, and may require that Buyer and
the officers and directors of Buyer (that are not officers of the Company)
obtain personnel security clearances with the SCI Caveat. As a result, no
Seller nor the Company will provide any information about, or access to, the
Company except (i) in accordance with, and as permitted by, the Industrial
Security Regulations, or (ii) after delivery by Buyer to the Shareholders
Representative and the

 



      
 

 



 

Company of evidence satisfactory to the Shareholders Representative and the
Company of Buyers compliance with, and as to the permissibility of providing
such access or information under, the NISP. Buyer further acknowledges and
agrees that, as applicable, consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will require approval of Buyer under, and compliance by Buyer with, the
Industrial Security Regulations, including, without limitation, the provisions
relating to foreign ownership, influence and control, facility clearances,
personnel security clearances and SCI Caveats, as required. As a result,
prior to Closing, Buyer and the Company shall cooperate to accomplish all
things reasonably ** ** necessary to comply with the Industrial Security
Regulations, and to cause the officers and directors of Buyer and any persons
who shall become officers, directors or management personnel of the Company to
comply with, and obtain all required approvals under, the NISP.

 



 

Section 6.17. _Termination of Stockholders  Agreement_. The Company and
the Sellers hereby acknowledge and agree that, effective upon the Closing,
that certain Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, dated September 19,
2015, by and among the Company and the Sellers shall terminate and be of no
further force or effect.

 



 

Section 6.18. _Section 280G_. If required to avoid the imposition of
Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code or the loss of deduction under Section
280G of the Code with respect to any payment or benefit in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company will (a) no later
than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, solicit from each "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) who has received or
may receive any payment or benefits that would constitute a "parachute
payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code) a waiver of
such disqualified individuals rights to some or all of such payments or
benefits (the " ** _Waived 280G Benefits_** " and, each such waiver, a " **
_280G Waiver_** ") so that all remaining payments and/or benefits, if any,
shall not be "excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code) and (b) no later than three (3) days prior to the Closing Date,
with respect to each individual who provides a duly executed 280G Waiver,
submit to a vote of the stockholders and/or such other Persons entitled to
vote (in a manner which satisfies all applicable requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and QandA-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such Treasury
Regulations) the rights of any such "disqualified individual" to receive the
Waived 280G Benefits. No later than five (5) days prior to soliciting 280G
Waivers from the "disqualified individuals," the Company shall provide Buyer a
reasonable opportunity to review, comment and approve drafts of such waivers
and disclosure materials (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). If any of the Waived 280G Benefits fail to be
approved by the stockholders as contemplated above, such Waived 280G Benefits
shall not be made or provided. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Buyer evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that a vote of the
stockholders was solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 6.18_ and that with respect to any Waived 280G Benefits either (i)
the requisite number of votes of the stockholders was obtained (the " ** _280G
Approval_** ") or (ii) the 280G Approval was not obtained, and, as a
consequence, any Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or provided.

(including extensions thereof). The parties shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any disagreement regarding such Tax Returns prior to filing. In the
event the parties are unable to resolve any dispute within ten (10) days prior
to the due date for filing such Tax Return, such dispute shall be resolved
pursuant to _Section 6.19(c)_, which resolution shall be binding on the
parties. All Company Transaction Expenses that are deductible for U.S.
federal income tax purposes shall be reported on the Companys U.S. federal
income Tax Return for the final Pre-Closing Tax Period except as otherwise
required by Law. The parties shall make any available elections under IRS
Revenue Procedure 2011-29 to treat 70% of any success-based fees that are
Company Transaction Expenses as amounts that did not facilitate the
Transactions. The Company shall not elect to waive any available carryback of
a net operating loss or net capital loss for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Overlap Period.

 



 

(b) Following the Closing, Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared
(at the Companys expense) and the Company shall file or cause to be filed all
Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company
for any Overlap Period and, subject to the rights to payment from the Sellers
under _Section 9.2(a)_, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid any Taxes

In the event the parties are unable to resolve any dispute within ten (10)
days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return, such dispute shall be
resolved pursuant to _Section 6.19(c)_, which resolution shall be binding on
the parties.

 



 

(c) Any dispute as to any matter covered by Section _6.19(a)_ or _(b)_
shall be resolved by the Neutral Auditor. The fees and expenses of the
Neutral Auditor shall be borne equally by the Sellers, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other. If any dispute with respect to a Tax Return is not
resolved prior to the due date of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be
filed in the manner that the party responsible for filing such Tax Return
deems correct without prejudice to the other partys rights hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The amount of any Taxes attributable to an Overlap Period shall be
apportioned between the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date and
the portion beginning after the Closing Date (i) in the case of property and
ad valorem Taxes, by apportioning such Taxes on a per diem basis and (ii) in
the case of all other Taxes, on a closing of the books basis, provided,
however, that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be
apportioned on a per diem basis.

 



 

(e) If a written notice of deficiency, proposed adjustment, assessment,
audit, examination or other administrative or court proceeding, suit, dispute
or other claim with respect to Taxes of the Company is received by Ultimate
Parent, Buyer or the Company or any of its Affiliates (a " ** _Notified
Party_** ") for which the Sellers would be expected to be liable pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)_ (a " ** _Tax Claim_** "), the Notified Party shall give the
Shareholders Representative prompt notice of such Tax Claim. After the
Closing, the Shareholders Representative shall have the right (at its option
and at the cost and expense of the Sellers), upon delivery of written notice
thereof by the Shareholders Representative to Buyer within thirty (30) days
(or such shorter period of time as may be necessitated by the nature of the
Tax Claim but in no event less than ten (10) days) of the Shareholders
Representatives receipt of notice of such Tax Claim to represent the
interests of the Company in any Tax Claim relating to a taxable period ending
on or before the Closing Date (and the Company shall provide the Shareholders
Representative with any necessary powers of attorney in connection therewith),
and Buyer shall have the right to represent the interests of the Company in
any Tax Claim relating to an Overlap Period; provided, however, that (i) the
controlling party shall keep the non-controlling party reasonably informed and
consult in good faith with the non-controlling party with respect to any issue
relating to such Tax Claim, (ii) the controlling party shall provide the non-
controlling party with copies of all correspondence, notices and other written

provide the non-controlling party with a copy of, and an opportunity to review
and comment on, all submissions made to a Governmental Entity in connection
with such Tax Claim, and (iv) the controlling party may not agree to a
settlement or compromise thereof without the prior written consent of the non-
controlling party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If the Shareholders Representative fails to notify
Buyer of its election to control a Tax Claim within thirty (30) days (or such
shorter period of time as may be necessitated by the nature of the Tax Claim
but in no event less than ten (10) days) following receipt by the
Shareholders Representative of a notice of such Tax Claim, Buyer shall
control such Tax Claim (at the Sellers expense) subject to the foregoing
proviso. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this _Section
6.19(e)_, on the one hand, and the provisions of _Section 9.5_, on the other,
the provisions of this _Section 6.19(e)_ shall control.

 



 

(f) After the Closing Date, the Sellers, on the one hand, and Ultimate
Parent and Buyer, on the other hand, shall (and shall cause their respective

has been finally resolved pursuant to this _Article IX_.

 



 

Section 9.2. _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article IX_, from and
after the Closing, Buyer, the Company and each of their respective Affiliates

against any Losses incurred by them related to, arising out of or as a result
of any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by such
Sellers in _Article III_ of this Agreement on and as of the date hereof and
as of the Closing Date (without giving effect to any materiality, "Material
Adverse Effect" or similar qualification contained or incorporated directly or
indirectly in any representation or warranty). Subject to the other
provisions of this _Article IX_, from and after the Closing, the Buyer
Indemnitees shall be indemnified and held harmless, by each Seller (severally
and not jointly) against any Losses incurred by them related to, arising out
of or as a result of (i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty made by the Sellers in _Article IV_ of this Agreement on and as of
the date hereof and (x) with respect to the Fundamental Representations, as of

or, after the Closing, by the Company under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.3. _Limitation on Indemnification, Mitigation_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, (i) the Sellers shall not be liable for any claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ (except in respect of the
Fundamental Representations, with any breaches of or inaccuracies in such
Fundamental Representations not being subject to the limitations set forth in
this _Section 9.3(a)_) unless and until the aggregate amount of Qualifying
Losses which may be recovered from

 



      
 

 



 

the Sellers as a group equals or exceeds the Deductible and (ii) the maximum
aggregate amount of indemnifiable Qualifying Losses which may be recovered by
Buyer for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ (except in respect
of the Fundamental Representations, with any breaches of or inaccuracies in
such Fundamental Representations not being subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Section 9.3(a)_) shall in no event be greater than the amount
remaining in the Escrow Fund after giving effect to all payments made pursuant
to _Section 2.6(f)_, if any (the " ** _Indemnity Cap_** ").

 



 

(b) Buyer and, after the Closing, the Company shall take and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
any Loss for which any of them could be entitled to indemnification under this
_Article IX_ upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be
expected to, or does actually, give rise thereto, including incurring costs to
the extent necessary to remedy the breach which gives rise to such Loss.

 



 

(c) Except as provided in the first sentence of _Section 9.6_, in no
event shall any Seller be responsible (i) for any indemnifiable Loss or Losses
in excess of such Sellers Payout Percentage of the Purchase Price, excluding
the Holdback Amount unless paid to the Sellers and (ii) for any indemnifiable
Loss or Losses pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_, ( _ii_ ) or _(iii)_ in
excess of such Sellers Payout Percentage of such Loss.

 



 

(d) Any indemnifiable claim with respect to any breach or nonperformance
by any party of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall be
limited to the Losses sustained and incurred by the indemnified party by
reason of such breach or nonperformance reduced by an amount equal to any cash
Tax benefit actually realized as a result of the utilization of the deductions
resulting directly from such Loss by the indemnified party prior to the end of
the year such indemnification payment is made, computed on a with and without
basis, treating all such deductions as the last item of deduction available to
the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no party shall be indemnified or reimbursed for any Loss arising or
resulting from any change in applicable Law or GAAP from and after the Closing
Date. No indemnified party shall be entitled to recover Losses in respect of
any claim or otherwise obtain reimbursement or restitution more than once with
respect to any claim hereunder.

 



 

Section 9.4. _Losses Net of Insurance, Etc_. The amount of any Loss
for which indemnification is provided under _Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section
9.2(b)_ shall be net of (i) any amount for which a reserve or accrual is
established in Closing Working Capital hereunder or which has been taken into
account as a current liability for purposes of the calculation of the Total
Consideration, (ii) any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party pursuant to
any indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any third party and
(iii) any proceeds under insurance policies maintained by the Company as of
the Closing Date and for which the premiums were paid in full as of the
Closing Date or other cash receipts or sources of reimbursement received as an
offset against such Loss (each source of recovery referred to in clauses (ii)
and (iii), a " ** _Collateral Source_** "), if any, attributable to such Loss.
If the amount to be netted hereunder in connection with a Collateral Source
from any payment required under _Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.2(b)_ is
determined after payment by the Indemnifying Party of any amount otherwise
required to be paid to an Indemnified Party to this _Article IX_, the
Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such
determination, any

 



      
 

 



 

amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this
_Article IX_ had such determination been made at the time of such payment,
and any excess recovery from a Collateral Source shall be applied to reduce
any future payments to be made by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section
9.2_ or _Section 9.3_.

 



 

Section 9.5. _Indemnification Procedure_. All claims for
indemnification by any Indemnified Party under _Article IX_ shall be asserted
and resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) In the event any claim or demand in respect of which an Indemnified
Party might seek indemnity under _Article IX_ is asserted against or sought
to be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than the
Sellers, the Company, Buyer or any Affiliate of the Company or Buyer (a " **
_Third Party Claim_** "), the Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice
with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified
Party fails to provide the Claim Notice with reasonable promptness after the
Indemnified Party receives notice of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to
such Third Party Claim to the extent that the Indemnifying Partys ability to
defend has been irreparably prejudiced by such failure of the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party will notify the Indemnified Party as soon as
practicable within the thirty (30) days following receipt by the Indemnifying
Party of a Claim Notice whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability
to the Indemnified Party under _Article IX_ and whether the Indemnifying
Party desires, at its sole cost and expense, to defend the Indemnified Party
against such Third Party Claim.

 



 

(i) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within
the thirty (30) days (or such shorter period of time as may be necessitated by
the nature of the Third Party Claim and specified in the Claim Notice)
following receipt by the Indemnifying Party of a Claim Notice that the
Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Indemnified Party with respect to the
Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Section 9.5(a)_ (which it may do only if
it, based solely on the facts and circumstances set forth in the Claim Notice,
acknowledges responsibility to provide indemnification in accordance with the
provisions of this _Article IX_ in connection with such Third Party Claim;
_provided_ that such acknowledgement shall not preclude the Indemnifying Party
from later asserting a defense that it is not obligated to provide
indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this _Article IX_ in the
event additional facts become known after such acknowledgement), then the
Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, such Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings,
which proceedings will be vigorously and diligently prosecuted by the
Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or will be settled at the discretion
of the Indemnifying Party (but only with the consent of the Indemnified Party,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, in the case of any settlement
that (i) relates to Taxes or (ii) provides for any relief other than the
payment of monetary damages as to which the Indemnified Party will be
indemnified from the Escrow Fund). The Indemnifying Party will have full
control of such defense and proceedings, including (except as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence) any settlement thereof; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Indemnified Party may, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnified Party, at any time prior to the Indemnifying Partys delivery of
the notice referred to in the first sentence of this clause (i), file any
motion, answer or other pleadings or take any other action that the
Indemnified Party reasonably believes to be necessary or appropriate to
protect its

 



      
 

 



 

interests; and _provided_ _further_ , that if requested by the Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnified Party will, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnifying Party
in contesting any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to
contest. The Indemnified Party may retain separate counsel to represent it
in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim
controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this clause (i), and the
Indemnified Party will bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
separate counsel, except as provided in the preceding sentence and except that
the Indemnifying Party will pay the costs and expenses of such separate
counsel if (x) in the Indemnified Partys good faith judgment, it is
advisable, based on advice of counsel, for the Indemnified Party to be
represented by separate counsel because a conflict or potential conflict
exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or (y) the
named parties to such Third Party Claim include both the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith,
based on advice of counsel, that defenses are available to it that are
unavailable to the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnified Party may retain or take over the control of the defense or
settlement of any Third Party Claim the defense of which the Indemnifying
Party has elected to control if the Indemnified Party irrevocably waives its
right to indemnity under _Article IX_ with respect to such Third Party Claim.

 



 

(ii) If (x) the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified
Party within the thirty (30) days following receipt by the Indemnifying Party
of a Claim Notice that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Third
Party Claim pursuant to _Section 9.5(a)_, (y) if the Indemnifying Party gives
such notice but fails to defend vigorously and diligently the Third Party
Claim or (z) (A) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with
an action, suit, proceeding or claim that is criminal in nature or being
brought by a Governmental Entity, (B) the Third Party Claim seeks an
injunction restricting the conduct of the Companys business, (C) the Third
Party Claim has a reasonable likelihood of resulting in Damages that would
exceed the remaining balance of the Escrow Fund or (D) the Third Party Claim
involves as a claimant a material customer, client or supplier of the Company,
then the Indemnified Party will have the right to defend, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Third Party Claim by all appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings will be prosecuted by the Indemnified Party in
good faith or will be settled at the discretion of the Indemnified Party (with
the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld). The Indemnified Party will have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including (except as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence) any settlement thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that if requested
by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party will, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party, provide reasonable cooperation to the
Indemnified Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which
the Indemnified Party is contesting.

 



 

(b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim under
_Article IX _against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity Notice with
reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party. The failure by any
Indemnified Party to give the Indemnity Notice shall not impair such partys
rights hereunder except to the extent that an Indemnifying Party demonstrates
that it has been irreparably prejudiced thereby. If the Indemnifying Party
notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not dispute the claim described in
such Indemnity Notice or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the
thirty (30) days following receipt by the Indemnifying Party of an Indemnity

 



      
 

 



 

Notice whether the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim described in such
Indemnity Notice, the Loss arising from the claim specified in such Indemnity
Notice will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under
_Article IX_ and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to
the Indemnified Party on demand following the final determination thereof. If
the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such
claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good
faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through
negotiations within the Resolution Period, such dispute shall be resolved by
litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with _Section
10.10_.

 



 

Section 9.6. _Sole Remedy/Waiver_. Except in the case of actual (and
not constructive) fraud or intentional misrepresentation and as set forth in
_Section 10.12_, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, in the event
that the Closing occurs, the remedies provided for in this _Article IX_ shall
be the parties sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of the
representations and warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement or any
claims relating to this Agreement or any other document, certificate or
agreement delivered pursuant hereto. In furtherance of the foregoing, the
parties hereby waive, effective upon the occurrence of the Closing, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims
and causes of action (including rights of contribution, if any, and claims for
rescission) known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise
in the future, that it may have against the Sellers or any of their
Representatives, the Shareholders Representative or any of its
Representatives, any member of the Board, or Buyer or any of its
Representatives, as the case may be, arising under or based upon any federal,
state or local Law (including any such Environmental Law or arising under or
based upon any securities Law, common law or otherwise) for any breach of the
representations and warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.7. _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. All indemnity
payments made pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be deemed to be, and each
of the Sellers, Buyer and the Company shall treat, and shall cause each of
their Subsidiaries to treat such payments as, an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for all federal, state, local and foreign income Tax purposes except as
otherwise required by applicable Law.

acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right
preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right.

not to, and agrees to cause its respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and
each of their respective successors and assigns, not to, assert any such claim

their respective successors and assigns, not to, assert any such claim against
the Buyer Releasees.

_provided_ , _however_ , that the Shareholders Representative may assign its

prior written consent. Any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section
10.6_ will be void.

 



 

Section 10.7. _Shareholders  Representative_.

 



 

(a) Each Seller has constituted, appointed and empowered effective from
and after the date of such consent, the Person designated as such by the Board
as the Shareholders Representative, for the benefit of the Sellers and the
exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of each Seller, in
connection with and to facilitate the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which shall include the power and authority to: (i)
enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Sellers and to enforce and
protect the rights and interests of such Persons arising out of or under or in
any manner relating to this Agreement and the transactions provided for
herein, and to take any and all actions which the Shareholders Representative
believes are necessary or appropriate under this Agreement for and on behalf
of the Sellers including, consenting to, compromising or settling any such
claims, conducting negotiations with Buyer and, after the Closing Date, the
Company and their respective Representatives regarding such claims, and, in
connection therewith, to (A) assert any claim or institute any Action; (B)
investigate, defend, contest or litigate any Third Party Claim pursuant to
_Section 9.5_ or any other Action or investigation initiated by Buyer and,
after the Closing Date, the Company or any other Person, or by any
Governmental Entity against the Shareholders Representative and/or any of the
Sellers, and receive process on behalf of any or all Sellers in any such
Action or investigation and compromise or settle on such terms as the

respect to, any such Third Party Claim or other Action or investigation; (C)
file any proofs of debt, claims and petitions as the Shareholders
Representative may deem advisable or necessary; (D) settle or compromise any
claims asserted under this Agreement; and (E) file and prosecute appeals from

it being understood that the Shareholders Representative shall not have any
obligation to take any such actions, and shall not have any liability for any
failure to take any such actions; (ii) to refrain from enforcing any right of
the Sellers arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such failure to act on the part of
the Shareholders Representative, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by the
Shareholders Representative or by the Sellers unless such waiver is in
writing signed by the waiving party or by the Shareholders Representative;
(iii) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Shareholders
Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or
proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) to engage special counsel, accountants
and other advisors and incur such other expenses on behalf of the Sellers in
connection with any matter arising under this Agreement, which such expenses
the Shareholders Representative is authorized to pay from the Expense
Holdback Amount; and (v) subject to _Section 10.8_, to negotiate and execute
any waivers or amendments of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Shareholders Representative shall be entitled to receive
reimbursement from, and be indemnified by, the Sellers for certain expenses,
charges and liabilities as provided below. In connection with this Agreement,
and in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the powers conferred
upon the Shareholders Representative hereunder, (i) the Shareholders
Representative shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to any Sellers by
reason of any error in judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted
hereunder, excepting only responsibility for any act or failure to act which
represents willful misconduct and (ii) the Shareholders Representative shall
be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other
independent experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in
judgment or other act or omission of the Shareholders Representative pursuant
to such advice shall in no event subject the Shareholders Representative to
liability to any Sellers. Each Seller shall indemnify, severally and not
jointly, based on such Sellers Payout Percentage, the Shareholders
Representative against all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, obligations,
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys, accountants and other
experts fees and the amount of any judgment against them, of any nature
whatsoever (including, any and all expense whatsoever reasonably incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or
threatened or any claims whatsoever), arising out of or in connection with any
Action, investigation, challenge, or in connection with any appeal thereof,
relating to the acts or omissions of the Shareholders Representative
hereunder. The foregoing indemnification shall not apply in the event of any
Action which finally adjudicates the liability of the Shareholders
Representative hereunder for its willful misconduct. In the event of any
indemnification hereunder, upon written notice from the Shareholders
Representative to the Sellers as to the existence of a deficiency toward the
payment of any such indemnification amount, each Seller shall promptly deliver
to the Shareholders Representative full payment of his, her or its Payout
Percentage of the amount of such deficiency.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the
Shareholders Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing
and/or any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Buyer and, after the Closing Date, the Company shall have the right
to rely upon all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Shareholders
Representative pursuant to this Agreement, all of which actions or omissions
shall be legally binding upon the Sellers.

 



 

(e) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency,
bankruptcy or liquidation of any Seller and (ii) shall survive the
consummation of the Transactions, and any action taken by the Shareholders
Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this Agreement shall be
effective and absolutely binding on each Seller notwithstanding any contrary
action of or direction from such Seller, except for actions or omissions of
the Shareholders Representative constituting willful misconduct.

 



 

(f) Each of the Company and Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
Shareholders Representative is a party to this Agreement solely to perform
certain administrative functions in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, each of the Company and Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that, other than in the Shareholders Representatives
role as a Seller, the Shareholders Representative shall have no liability to,
and shall not be liable for any Losses of, any of the Company or Buyer in
connection with any obligations of the Shareholders Representative under this
Agreement or otherwise in respect of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, except to the extent such Losses shall be proven to be
the direct result of willful misconduct by the Shareholders Representative in
connection with the performance of its obligations hereunder.

 



 

Section 10.8. _Amendment and Modification_. This Agreement may not be
amended except by a written instrument executed by all parties to this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.9. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and all of
which together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument. Signed

Section 10.10. _Applicable Law_. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE LEGAL RELATIONS
BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS
RULES THEREOF. THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN NEW YORK COUNTY IN
THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER ANY AND ALL
DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO, WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY, ARISING OUT OF

CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THE PARTIES CONSENT TO AND AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES AND
AGREES NOT TO ASSERT IN ANY SUCH DISPUTE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY CLAIM THAT

 



      
 

 



 

(I) SUCH PARTY IS NOT PERSONALLY SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS,
(II) SUCH PARTY AND SUCH PARTYS PROPERTY ARE IMMUNE FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS
ISSUED BY SUCH COURTS OR (III) ANY LITIGATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING COMMENCED IN
SUCH COURTS IS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE
THAT MAILING OF PROCESS OR OTHER PAPERS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ACTION OR
PROCEEDING IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN _SECTION 10.3_, OR IN SUCH OTHER MANNER
AS MAY BE PERMITTED BY LAW, SHALL BE VALID AND SUFFICIENT SERVICE THEREOF AND

jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against
its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and this Agreement
shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable term, provision, covenant or restriction or

Section 10.12. _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached or threatened to be breached and that an award of money damages would
be inadequate in such event. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that the parties
and the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement shall be entitled to
equitable relief, without proof of actual damages, including an injunction or
injunctions or Orders for specific performance to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (including any Order sought by the Company and/or the Shareholders
Representative to cause Buyer to perform its agreements and covenants
contained in this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity as a remedy for any such breach or threatened
breach). Each party further agrees that no other party hereto or any other
Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section 10.12_, and each party hereto (a) irrevocably
waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting
of any such bond or similar instrument and (b) agrees to cooperate fully in
any attempt by the other party or parties in obtaining such equitable relief.
Each party further agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise
in response to any action for equitable relief is that it contests the
existence of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.13. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, AND AGREES TO CAUSE ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO

If and to the extent any information required to be furnished in any section
of the Company Disclosure Letter is contained in any other section thereof or

liability or obligation of the Sellers or the Company. By listing matters on
the Company Disclosure Letter, none of the Sellers, the Company or any of
their Affiliates shall be deemed to have (i) established any materiality
standard, admitted any liability or concluded that one or more of such matters

the scope or effect of the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE XI - GUARANTY

 



 

Section 11.1. _Parent Guaranty_.

 



 

(a) Ultimate Parent is executing this Agreement to guaranty the
performance of Buyer and, after the Closing Date, the Company under this
Agreement and any agreement executed pursuant to this Agreement. Ultimate
Parent guarantees irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally and as a primary
obligation that Buyer and, after the Closing Date, the Company shall fully,
completely and timely pay and perform all their obligations and assume all
their Liabilities contained in this Agreement and any agreement executed
pursuant to this Agreement (the " ** _Guaranteed Obligations_** "). If Buyer
or, after the Closing Date, the Company fails or refuses to pay or perform any
such obligations and Liabilities when due, Ultimate Parent shall, upon the
written request of the Company prior to the Closing or the Shareholders
Representative after the Closing (a " ** _Performance Demand_** "),
immediately pay or perform such obligations, as applicable. A single
Performance Demand shall be effective as to any specific default during the
continuance of such default until Buyer, the Company or Ultimate Parent shall
have cured such default, and additional written demands concerning such
default shall not be required until such default is cured.

 



 

(b) This _Section 11.1_ is a guaranty of payment and performance and
not of collection. There are no conditions precedent to the enforcement of
this _Section 11.1_. The obligations of Ultimate Parent hereunder shall be
continuing, absolute and unconditional and,

 



      
 

 



 

without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released,
discharged or otherwise affected by:

 



 

(i) any invalidity, illegality or unenforceability against Buyer or,
after the Closing Date, the Company of this Agreement or any agreement
executed pursuant to this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) any modification, amendment, restatement, waiver or rescission
of, or any consent to the departure from, any of the terms of this Agreement
or any agreement executed pursuant to this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release
in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation, by operation of Law or otherwise, or
any assignment of any Guaranteed Obligation by the Company or the
Shareholders Representative on behalf of the Sellers;

 



 

(iv) any change in the corporate existence structure or ownership of
Buyer or, after the Closing Date, the Company;

 



 

(v) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar
proceeding affecting Buyer or, after the Closing Date, the Company or their
assets or any resulting release or discharge of any Guaranteed Obligation;

 



 

(vi) any requirement that the Company or the Shareholders
Representative exhaust any right or remedy or take any action against the
Buyer or, after the Closing Date, the Company or any other Person before
seeking to enforce the obligations of Ultimate Parent under this _Section
11.1_;

 



 

(vii) the existence of any defense, set-off or other rights (other than
a defense of payment or performance) that Ultimate Parent may have at any time
against Buyer, the Company or the Shareholders Representative or any other
Person, whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transactions; or

 



 

(viii) any other act or failure to act or delay of any kind by Buyer or
the Company.

 



 

(c) This _Section 11.1_ shall continue to be effective, or be
automatically reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment or
performance, or any part thereof, of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be restored, returned or rejected by the Sellers
for any reason, including, upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution,
liquidation or reorganization of Buyer or, after the Closing Date, the
Company, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor
or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, Buyer or, after the
Closing Date, the Company or any substantial part of their respective
property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.
Ultimate Parent agrees that it will indemnify the Sellers on demand for all
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements)
incurred by the Sellers in connection with such rescission or restoration
which amounts shall be in addition to all other obligations hereunder. If any
Seller is required to refund part or all of any payment of Buyer or, after the
Closing Date, the Company with respect

 



      
 

 



 

to any of the Guaranteed Obligations, such payment shall not constitute a
release of Ultimate Parent from any liability hereunder, and Ultimate Parents
liability hereunder shall be reinstated to the fullest extent allowed under
applicable Law and shall not be construed to be diminished in any manner.

 



 

Section 11.2. _Representations and Warranties of the Ultimate Parent_.

 



 

(a) Ultimate Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of Delaware. Ultimate Parent has the
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement, and the performance of Ultimate Parents obligations hereunder,
have been, or will have been at the Closing, duly authorized by all requisite
corporate action and no other corporate action on the part of Ultimate Parent
is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement. This Agreement, assuming the due execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the other parties hereto, constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Ultimate Parent, enforceable against Ultimate Parent in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally
and by general equitable principles.

 



 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by Ultimate Parent of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, do
not and will not (i) violate any provision of the Organizational Documents of
Ultimate Parent, (ii) result in a breach of, or default under, or right to
accelerate with respect to, any term or provision of any Contract, commitment
or other obligation to which Ultimate Parent or any of its Affiliates is a
party or is subject or (iii) violate or result in a breach of or constitute a
default under any Law or other restriction of any Governmental Entity to which
Ultimate Parent is subject.

 



 

(c) The execution, delivery and performance by Ultimate Parent of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby do not require any
consents, waivers, authorizations or approvals of, or filings with, any third
Persons which have not been obtained by Ultimate Parent.

 



 

(d) As of the date hereof and on the Closing Date, Ultimate Parent has
and will have unrestricted cash on hand and, if necessary, unrestricted cash
available to it under credit facilities in place on the date hereof,
sufficient to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Ultimate Parent is not entering into the transactions contemplated
hereby with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors. Immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, Ultimate Parent will be Solvent and will have adequate capital to
carry on its businesses in the ordinary course.

 ** _FORM OF EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT_**

 



 

 **THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT** ("Agreement") is made and entered into by and
between [NAME] an individual ("Employee"), and Magellan Health, Inc. on behalf
of itself and its present and future subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively
referred to herein as "Employer" or the "Company").

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , reference is made to that certain Share Purchase Agreement,
dated as of May , 2016, by and among Magellan Healthcare, Inc., Armed
Forces Services Corporation ("AFSC"), the shareholders of AFSC party thereto,
and the Company (the "Purchase Agreement");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Employer desires to obtain the services of Employee and
Employee desires to render services to Employer; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Employer and Employee desire to set forth the terms and
conditions of Employees employment with Employer under this Agreement;

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing recitals and of the
mutual covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties agree
as follows:

 



 

 ** _STATEMENT OF AGREEMENT_**

 



 

 **1.** **_Employment_.** Employer agrees to employ Employee, and
Employee accepts such employment in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, for a term of one year commencing on the Closing Date (as defined
in the Purchase Agreement), and unless terminated earlier in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, ending on the anniversary of the Closing
Date. Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically renew for twelve (12)
month periods, unless sooner terminated as provided herein. If either party
desires not to renew the Agreement, they must provide the other party with
written notice of their intent not to renew the Agreement at least ninety (90)
days prior to the next renewal date. Non-renewal of the Agreement by either
party will in all cases result in termination of employment at the non-renewal
date. Employers notice of intent not to renew the Agreement shall be deemed
to be a termination without cause and the provisions of Section 6(c) shall
apply.

 



 

 **2.** ** _Position and Duties of Employee_.** Employee will
serve as [TITLE] and shall have the usual and customary duties, responsibility
and authority of a [TITLE]. Employee agrees to serve in such position, or in
such other positions as Employer and Employee may mutually agree from time to
time, and to perform the duties that Employer may assign from time to time to
Employee that are consistent with Employees position, at the same or greater
base salary level and a similar location, until the expiration of the term or
such time as Employees employment with Employer is terminated pursuant to
this Agreement.

 



 

 **3.** **_Time Devoted_. **Employee will devote his or her full
business time and energy to the business affairs and interests of Employer,
and will use his or her best efforts and abilities to promote Employers
interests. Employee agrees that he or she will diligently endeavor to

      
 

 



 

perform services contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with
his or her position and in accordance with the policies established by the
Employer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee may participate in social,
charitable, civic activities and such other personal affairs of Employee as do
not interfere with performance of his or her duties hereunder. The parties
have also agreed that Employee may serve as a director for other entities,
provided that if such other entity is a for-profit enterprise, Employee shall
first obtain the consent of Employer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Expenditure of a reasonable amount of time for personal matters and
business and charitable activities shall not be deemed to be a breach of this
Agreement, provided that those activities benefit the Company and/or do not
materially interfere with the services required to be rendered to the Company
under this Agreement.

 



 

 **4.** **_Compensation_.**

 



 

(a) _Base Salary_. Employer will pay Employee an annual base salary in
the amount of [$XXX,XXX] which amount will be paid in semi-monthly intervals
less appropriate withholdings for federal and state taxes and other deductions
authorized by Employee. Such salary will be subject to review and potential
increases by Employer not less than annually and the term "Base Salary" shall
mean the base salary as so increased.

 



 

(b) _Benefits_. Employee will be eligible to participate in Employers
Benefit Plans commensurate with his or her position. Employee will receive
separate information detailing the terms of such Benefit Plans and the terms
of those plans will control. Employee also will be eligible to participate in
any annual incentive bonus plan and long-term incentive plan generally
applicable to employees at his or her level. Employees annual target bonus
opportunity will be no less than [XX%] of Base Salary. Any annual bonus for
which Employee is entitled in respect of the 2016 calendar year will be pro-
rated based upon the number of days that Employee has been employed pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement. Annual and long-term incentive awards, if
earned, will be determined and paid or granted (unless validly deferred if
then permitted by the Company) between January 1 and March 15 of the year
following the performance year. During the term of this Agreement, Employee
will be entitled to such other benefits of employment with Employer as are now
or may later be in effect for salaried employees of Employer, and also will be
eligible to participate in other benefits adopted for employees at his or her
level.

 



 

(c) _Stock Options_. Employer shall grant to Employee an option to
purchase [XXXX] shares of the common stock of Employer at fair market value on
the first business day of the month following the month of commencement of
employment under this Agreement (the "Option") pursuant to Employers 2011
Management Incentive Plan, or a successor plan. One-third of the total number
of shares that are subject to the Option shall vest on each of the first three
anniversaries of the date of grant, provided that Employee is still employed
by Employer on each such vesting date. The Option and all other options
granted Employee by Employer shall be subject to any applicable stock option
plan, option certificate and shareholder and/or option holder agreements and
other restrictions and limitations generally applicable to equity held by
executives of Employer or otherwise required by law.

 



 

(d) [ _Spot Bonus_. To the extent not paid by AFSC prior to the Closing
Date, Employee shall be eligible to receive a $50,000 cash bonus, payable on
the first regular payroll

 



      
 

 



 

date following the Closing Date. In addition, Employee shall be eligible to
receive a $50,000 cash bonus, payable on the first regular payroll date
following the first anniversary of the Closing Date; provided that Employee
remains employed by Employer on the first anniversary of the Closing Date.](1)

 



 

(e) [ _Transaction Bonus_. Employee shall be eligible to receive a cash
bonus in an aggregate amount of $[] (the "Transaction Bonus"). The
Transaction Bonus shall be payable by the Company in three installments as
follows: (i) to the extent not paid by AFSC prior to the Closing Date, $[] of
the Transaction Bonus shall be payable to Employee on the first regular
payroll date following the Closing Date, (ii) $[] of the Transaction Bonus
shall be payable to Employee on the first regular payroll date following the
first anniversary of the Closing Date and (iii) $[] of the Transaction Bonus
shall be payable to Employee on the first regular payroll date following the
second anniversary of the Closing Date (each such payment in clauses (i)
through (iii), a "Transaction Bonus Payment"); provided that Employee shall
only be entitled to the Transaction Bonus Payment described in clauses (ii)
and (iii) if Employee remains employed by Employer on the applicable
anniversary of the Closing Date.](2) [Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if required to avoid the imposition of taxes under
Code Section 4999, Employee shall waive her right to the portion of the
Transaction Bonus described in this _Section 4(e)_ ("Waived Payment") to the
minimum extent necessary such that the remaining portion of the Transaction
Bonus together with any other payments to which Employee is entitled, if any,
shall not be a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Code Section 280G,
and the Waived Payment shall not be paid to Employee unless the Waived Payment
is approved by the stockholders of AFSC prior to the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement in a manner that satisfies
the stockholder approval requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.](3)

 



 

 **5.** **_Expenses_.** During the term of this Agreement,
Employer will reimburse Employee promptly for all reasonable travel,
entertainment, parking, business meetings and similar expenditures in
pursuance and furtherance of Employers business upon receipt of reasonably
supporting documentation as required by Employers policies applicable to its
employees generally, subject to Section 10(a) (iii).

 



 

 **6.** ** _Termination_.**

 



 

(a) _Termination Due to Resignation._ Employee may resign his or her
employment at any time by giving thirty (30) days written notice of

benefits from Employer, will terminate upon the effective date of Employees
termination.

  (1) _NTD_ : To be included as appropriate.

 



 

(2) _NTD_ : To be included as appropriate. Include the following language if
not applicable  "To the extent not paid by AFSC prior to the Closing Date,

"Transaction Bonus"), payable to Employee on the first regular payroll date
following the Closing Date."

 



 

(3) _NTD_ : To be included as appropriate.

 



      
 

 



 

If Employee resigns pursuant to this Section 6(a), Employers only remaining
financial obligation to Employee under this Agreement will be to pay, subject
to Section 10: (i) any earned but unpaid Base Salary and accrued Paid Time Off
through the effective date of Employees termination; (ii) reimbursement of
expenses incurred by Employee through the effective date of termination which
are reimbursable pursuant to this Agreement; and (iii) the Employees vested
portion of any award under the Companys Benefit Plans subject to its terms
and conditions.

 



 

(b) _Termination with Cause_. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, Employees employment, and Employees right to receive compensation
and benefits from Employer, will be terminated for cause at the discretion of
Employer under the following circumstances:

 



 

(i) Employees commission of an act of fraud or dishonesty involving his or
her duties on behalf of Employer;

 



 

(ii) Employees failure or refusal to perform duties reasonably assigned to
Employee (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to
physical or mental illness) or other material breach of any material term
under this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) Employees material failure or refusal to abide by Employers policies,
rules, procedures or directives which are provided to Employee in writing; or

 



 

(iv) Employees conviction of a felony or a misdemeanor involving moral
turpitude.

 



 

If Employee is terminated pursuant to this Section 6(b), Employers only
remaining financial obligation to Employee under this Agreement will be to
pay, subject to Section 10: (i) any earned but unpaid Base Salary and accrued
Paid Time Off through the date of Employees termination; (ii) reimbursement
of expenses incurred by Employee through the date of termination which are
reimbursable pursuant to this Agreement; and (iii) the Employees vested
portion of any award under the Companys Benefit Plans subject to its terms
and conditions.

 



 

For the events described in Sections 6(b) (ii) and (iii), Employer will give
Employee written notice of such deficiency and a 30 day opportunity to cure
such situation.

 



 

(c) _Termination Without Cause_. Employer or Employee may terminate
this Agreement without cause at any time. "Without cause" termination shall
include, but not be limited to termination by Employee following: (i)
Employers notice to Employee of its intent not to renew this Agreement in
accordance with the provisions of Section 1 hereof; (ii) Employers notice to
Employee that his or her position will be relocated to an office which is
greater than 25 miles from Employees prior work location; (iii) Employers
reduction of Employees Base Salary (excluding any reduction, occurring at
least six months after the effective date of this Agreement, of up to five
percent (5%) applied uniformly to all similarly situated employee of Employer
due to business circumstances) or Employers reduction of Employees target
bonus opportunity to any amount less than the target bonus opportunity

 



      
 

 



 

identified in Section 4(b) of this Agreement; (iv) material diminution in
Employees title, authority, duties or responsibilities; or (v) any other
breach by Employer of any material term under this Agreement; provided,
however, that in all cases Employee must have given notice to Employer that an
event under clause (ii) through (v) has occurred and the circumstance must
remain uncorrected by Employer after the expiration of 30 days after receipt
of such notice. If Employer or Employee terminates this Agreement without
cause, Employer shall continue to pay, subject to Section 10, Employee the
compensation provided for in Section 4(a) of this Agreement for a period of
time equal to twelve (12) months, commencing immediately following the
termination date (the " _Severance Period_ "). Such pay continuation is
contingent upon Employee executing Employers standard severance agreement
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_, which incorporates
a general release, at the time of termination. In addition, Employee will
receive (i) any earned but unpaid Base Salary and accrued Paid Time Off
through the date of Employees termination; (ii) reimbursement of expenses
incurred by Employee through the date of termination which are reimbursable
pursuant to this Agreement; and (iii) the Employees vested portion of any
Magellan Health, Inc. retirement, deferred compensation or other benefit plan,
including but not limited to, any equity or long-term incentive awards, in
accordance with the terms of those awards. If Employee participates in any
incentive bonus plan(s), including but not limited to, any long term incentive
plan(s), Employer may pay Employee, on a pro-rata basis, the amount of such
plan(s) as Employee would have earned if Employee had been employed for the
full calendar year. The pro-ration will be determined by the fraction of the
number of months in the calendar year in which the Employee worked (rounded to
the nearest whole month) divided by 12 months. In determining whether a pro-
rata amount shall be paid to Employee, the Employer may consider factors that
include but are not limited to (i) the Employees target bonus (percentage of
base salary), (ii) the Companys financial performance and (iii) the
Employees achievement of his or her specific performance objectives. At the
time of termination, Employer shall determine the Employees pro-rata amount,
if any. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any payout of such bonus amount shall
be contingent upon the Company satisfying the financial targets established by
the Companys Board of Directors. Payment of any bonus shall be made at the
time of the annual bonus payout for all employees, subject to Section 4(b).
COBRA coverage may be elected to continue health, dental, and vision insurance
during the Severance Period and beyond. If COBRA coverage is elected, Employee
will pay only the employee contribution rate for the health insurance portion
of the COBRA coverage during the Severance Period. Dental and vision coverage
under COBRA will be billed at the full COBRA rate.

 



 

(d) _Automatic Termination_. This Agreement will terminate
automatically upon the death or permanent disability of Employee. Employee
will be deemed to be "Disabled" or to suffer from a "Disability" within the
meaning of this Agreement if, because of a physical or mental impairment,
Employee has been unable to perform the essential functions of his or her
position, with or without reasonable accommodation, for a period of 180
consecutive days, or if Employee can reasonably be expected to be unable to
perform the essential functions of his or her position for such period. If
Employee is terminated pursuant to this Section 6(d), Employee will receive,
subject to Section 10, (i) any earned but unpaid Base Salary and accrued Paid
Time Off through the date of Employees termination; (ii) reimbursement of
expenses incurred by Employee through the date of termination which are
reimbursable pursuant to this Agreement; and (iii) the Employees vested
portion of any Magellan Health, Inc. retirement, deferred

 



      
 

 



 

compensation or other benefit plan, including but not limited to, any equity
or long-term incentive awards. If Employee participates in any incentive bonus
plan(s), including but not limited to, any long term incentive plan(s),
Employer may pay Employee, on a pro-rata basis, the amount of such plan(s) as
Employee would have earned if Employee had been employed for the full calendar
year. The pro-ration will be determined by the fraction of the number of
months in the calendar year in which the Employee worked (rounded to the
nearest whole month) divided by 12 months. In determining whether a pro-rata
amount shall be paid to Employee, the Employer may consider factors that
include but are not limited to (i) the Employees target bonus (percentage of
base salary); (ii) the Companys financial performance; and (iii) the
Employees achievement of his or her specific performance objectives. At the
time of termination, Employer shall determine the Employees pro-rata amount,
if any. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any payout of such bonus amount shall
be contingent upon the Company satisfying the financial targets established by
the Companys Board of Directors. Payment of any bonus shall be made at the
time of the annual bonus payout for all employees, subject to Section 4(b).

 



 

(e) _Effect of Termination_. Except as otherwise provided for in this
Section 6, upon termination of this Agreement, all rights and obligations
under this Agreement will cease except for (i) the rights and obligations
under Sections 4 and 5 to the extent Employee has not been compensated or
reimbursed for services performed prior to termination (the amount of
compensation to be prorated for the portion of the pay period prior to
termination); (ii) the rights and obligations under Sections 7, 8 and 9; and
(iii) all procedural and remedial provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

 **7.** ** _Protection of Confidential Information/Non-
Competition/Non-Solicitation_.**

 



 

Employee covenants and agrees as follows:

 



 

(a)(i) _Confidential Information:_ During Employers employment of
Employee and following the termination of Employees employment for any
reason, Employee will not use or disclose, directly or indirectly, for any
reason whatsoever or in any way, other than at the direction of Employer
during the course of Employees employment or after receipt of the prior
written consent of Employer, any confidential information of Employer or its
controlled subsidiaries or affiliates, that comes into his or her knowledge
during his or her employment by Employer (the "Confidential Information" as
hereinafter defined). The obligation not to use or disclose any Confidential
Information will not apply to any Confidential Information that is or becomes
public knowledge through no fault of Employee, but the termination of the
obligation for non-use or nondisclosure by reason of such information becoming
public will extend only from the date such information becomes public
knowledge. The above will be without prejudice to any additional rights or
remedies of Employer under any state or federal law protecting trade secrets
or other information.

 



 

(a)(ii) _Trade Secrets._ Employee shall hold in confidence all Trade
Secrets of Employer, its direct and indirect subsidiaries, and/or its
customers that came into his or her knowledge during his or her employment by
Employer and shall not disclose, publish or make use of at any time after the
date hereof such Trade Secrets, other than at the direction of Employer, for
as long as the information remains a Trade Secret.

 



      
 

 



 

(a)(iii) For purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions apply:
"Confidential Information" means any data or information, other than Trade
Secrets, that is valuable to Employer and not generally known to the public or
to competitors of Employer, and which, for clarification, excludes general
"know how." It is understood that the term "Confidential Information" does
not mean and shall not include information which:

 



 

(a) is or subsequently becomes publicly available without the breach of any
obligation owed to the Employer;

 



 

(b) was in Employees possession prior to the date of Employees employment
with the Company or ASFC;

 



 

(c) is disclosed with the prior written approval of the Employer; or

 



 

(d) is obligated to be produced under order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or a valid administrative, congressional, or other subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process; **provided, however,** that
upon issuance of any such order, subpoena, demand or other process, the
Employee shall promptly notify the Employer and shall provide the Employer
with an opportunity (if then available) to contest, at the Employers expense,
the propriety of such order or subpoena (or to arrange for appropriate
safeguards against any further disclosure by the court or administrative or
congressional body seeking to compel disclosure of such Confidential
Information).

 



 

"Trade Secret" means information including, but not limited to, any technical
or non-technical data, formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method,
technique, drawing, process, financial data, financial plan, product plan,
list of actual or potential customers or suppliers or other information
similar to any of the foregoing, which (i) derives economic value, actual or
potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily
ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can derive economic value
from its disclosure or use; and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are
reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.

 



 

(a)(iv) _Interpretation._ The restrictions stated in paragraphs 7(a)(i) and
7(a)(ii) are in addition to and not in lieu of protections afforded to trade
secrets and confidential information under applicable state law. Nothing in
this Agreement is intended to or shall be interpreted as diminishing or
otherwise limiting Employers right under applicable state law to protect its
trade secrets and confidential information.

 



 

(b) _Non-Competition_.

 



 

(i) Employee covenants and agrees that during the term of his or her
employment with Employer and for a period of 24 months immediately following
the termination of said employment for any reason, he or she will not, on his
or her own behalf or as a partner, officer, director, employee, agent, or
consultant of any other person or entity, directly or indirectly, engage or
attempt to engage

 



      
 

 



 

in the business of developing, providing or selling products or services in
the United States that are products or services developed, provided or offered
by Employer or its subsidiaries and affiliates at the time of the termination
of this Agreement (whether such products or services are developed, provided
or offered by such other person or entity individually or on an integrated
basis with other products or services developed, provided or offered directly
by such person or entity or through affiliated persons or entities) unless
waived in writing by Employer in its sole discretion. Employee recognizes that
the above restriction is reasonable and necessary to protect the interest of
the Employer and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates.

 



 

(ii) The foregoing clause (i) shall not prevent Employee from accepting
employment with or performing services for an enterprise if such enterprise is
also engaged in other lines of business and Employees services are restricted
to services or employment that are not engaged in the activities described in
clause (i) above.

 



 

(iii) During the 24-month period immediately following Employees termination
from his or her employment with Employer, Employee may submit a written
request to Employer outlining a proposed employment or other employment
opportunity that Employee is considering. Employer will review such request,
and make a determination within ten (10) business days following receipt of
such request, in its sole discretion, as to whether the opportunity would
constitute a breach of the non-competition covenant and/or whether or not
Employer is willing to waive the requirements of this subsection (b) with
respect to such opportunity. For the avoidance of doubt, the Employers
determination of what does or does not constitute a breach of the non-
competition covenant is not binding upon any court or arbitrator for purposes
of any action relating to the enforcement of such covenant.

 



 

(c) _Non-Solicitation_ **.** To protect the goodwill of Employer
and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates, or the customers of Employer
and its subsidiaries and affiliates, Employee agrees that, for a period of 24
months immediately following the termination of his or her employment with
Employer, he or she will not, without the prior written permission of
Employer, directly or indirectly, for himself or herself or on behalf of any
other person or entity, solicit, divert away, take away or attempt to solicit
or take away any Customer of Employer for purposes of providing or selling
services that are offered by Employer, if Employer, or the particular
controlled subsidiary or affiliate of Employer, is then still engaged in the
sale or provision of such services at the time of the solicitation. For
purposes of this Section 7(c), "Customer" means any

 



     

 



 

individual or entity to whom Employer or its controlled subsidiaries or
affiliates has provided, or contracted to provide, services and with whom
Employee had, alone or in conjunction with others, contact with or knowledge
of, during the twelve months prior to the termination of his or her
employment. For purposes of this Section 7(c), Employee had contact with or
knowledge of a customer if (i) Employee had business dealings with the
customer on behalf of Employer or its controlled subsidiaries or affiliates;
(ii) Employee was responsible for supervising or coordinating the dealings
between the customer and Employer or its controlled subsidiaries or
affiliates; or (iii) Employee obtained or had access to trade secrets or
confidential information about the customer as a result of Employees
association with Employer or its controlled subsidiaries or affiliates.

 



 

(d) _Non-Solicitation/Hiring of Employees_ **.** During Employers
employment of Employee and for a period of 24 months following the termination
of Employees employment with Employer for any reason, Employee will not
solicit for employment or hire, directly or indirectly, any employee of
Employer or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates who was employed with
Employer or its controlled subsidiaries or affiliates within the 24-month
period immediately prior to Employees termination. General solicitations or
advertisements not specifically targeted at employees of Employer or any of
its subsidiaries or affiliates shall not violate this Section 7(d).

 



 

 **8.** **_Work Made for Hire_. **Employee agrees that any
written program materials, protocols, research papers, other writings, as well
as improvements, inventions, new techniques, programs or products (the "Work")
made or developed by Employee within or after normal working hours during the
term of this Agreement and relating to the business or activities of Employer
or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, shall be deemed to have been made or
developed by Employee solely for the benefit of Employer and will be
considered "work made for hire" within the meaning of the United States
Copyright Act, Title 17, United States Code, which vests all copyright
interest in and to the Work in the Employer. In the event, however, that any
court of competent jurisdiction finally declares that the Work is not or was
not a work made for hire as agreed, Employee agrees to assign, convey, and
transfer to the Employer all right, title and interest Employee may presently
have or may have or be deemed to have in and to any such Work and in the
copyright of such work, including but not limited to, all rights of
reproduction, distribution, publication, public performance, public display
and preparation of derivative works, and all rights of ownership and
possession of the original fixation of the Work and any and all copies.
Additionally, Employee agrees to execute any documents necessary for Employer
to record and/or perfect its ownership of the Work and the applicable
copyright.

 



 

 **9.** **_Property of Employer_. **Employee agrees that, upon
the termination of Employees employment with Employer, Employee will
immediately surrender to Employer all property, equipment, funds, lists,
books, records and other materials of Employer or its controlled subsidiaries
or affiliates in the possession of or provided to Employee.

 



 

 **10**. **_Special Rules for Compliance with Code Section 409A_.**
This Section 10 serves to ensure compliance with applicable requirements of
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). Certain provisions of
this Section 10 modify other provisions of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement. If the terms of this Section 10 conflict with other terms of the
Agreement, the terms of this Section 10 control.

 



 

(a) _Timing of Certain Payments_ **.** Payments and benefits
specified under this Agreement shall be paid at the times specified as
follows:

 



 

(i) _Accrued Payments at Termination_. Sections 6(a)  (d) of this
Agreement require payment of amounts earned but unpaid or accrued at the date
of Employees termination. Unless the amount is payable under an applicable
plan, program or arrangement on explicit terms providing for a delay in
payment compliant with Code Section 409A, these amounts shall be payable at
the date the amounts otherwise would have been payable under the applicable
plans, programs and arrangements but in no event more than 30 days after
Employees termination of employment (subject to 10(d)).

 



 

(ii) _Expense Reimbursements._ Any payment under Section 5 or
otherwise as an expense reimbursement hereunder must be paid no later than the
end of Employees taxable year next following the taxable year in which
Employee incurred the reimbursable expense. With regard to any provision
herein that provides for expense reimbursement or in-kind benefits, except as
permitted by Code Section 409A, (a) the right to reimbursement or in-kind
benefits will not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit,
and (b) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursements or in-kind benefits
provided during any taxable year will not affect the expenses eligible for
reimbursement or in-kind benefits to be provided in any other taxable year.

 



 

(iii) _Other Payments_. Any other payment or benefit required under
this Agreement to be paid in a lump sum or otherwise to be paid promptly at or
following a date or event shall be paid within five days after the due date,
subject to Section 10(b), (c) and (d) below.

 



 

(iv) _No Influence on Year of Payment_. In the case of any payment
under the Agreement payable during a specified period of time following a
termination or other event (including any payment for which the permitted
payment period begins in one calendar year and ends in a subsequent calendar
year), Employee shall have no right to elect in which year the payment will be
made, and the Companys determination of when to make the payment shall not be
influenced in any way by Employee.

 



 

(b) _Special Rules for Severance Payments_. In the case of
payments in the nature of continuation of payments under Section 4(a) required
under Section 6(c) (the "Severance Payments"), the following rules will apply:

 



 

(i) _Separate Payments. _Each monthly installment of the Severance Payments
shall

 



      
 

 



 

be deemed to be a separate payment for all purposes, including for purposes of
Section 409A.

 



 

(ii) _Severance Payment Timing Rules_. Each installment of Severance Payments
shall be treated as follows for purposes of Section 409A:

 



 

(A) Installments payable during the year of termination and by March 15 of the
year following termination shall, to the maximum extent possible, be deemed to
constitute a short-term deferral under Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(b)(4);

 

(B) Installments payable during the period within six months after
termination, to the extent not covered by Section 10(b)(ii)(A), shall, to the
maximum extent possible, be deemed to constitute amounts payable under the
"two-year/two-times" exclusion from being a deferral of compensation under
Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii);

 

(C) To the extent that the "two-year/two-times" exclusion from being a
deferral of compensation under Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) has
not been fully applied by virtue of Section 10(b)(ii)(B), installments payable
as Severance Payments shall be excluded, to the maximum extent possible, by
such "two-years/two-times" exclusion (applied in the reverse order of payment
of the installments  that is, to the latest installments first); and

 

(D) All installments of the Severance Payment not covered by Section
10(b)(ii)(A), (B) and (C) shall be paid at the applicable installment payment
date in compliance with Section 409A, except that any such payment shall be
subject to the six-month delay rule of Section 10(d).

 



 

(c) _Special Rules for Other Payments_. With respect to any bonus
amount that might be payable following termination of employment under any
plan or arrangement covering Employee as may then be in effect, ), the
following rules will apply:

 



 

(i) _Separate Payments_. The amount payable thereunder shall each
be deemed to be a separate payment for all purposes, including for purposes of
Section 409A (subject to any further designation of separate payments
explicitly made in any separately identifiable plan or arrangement for
purposes of Section 409A).

 



 

(ii) _Payment Timing Rules_. Except as specifically provided in
Section 6(c) with respect to any pro-rata annual bonus, a payment referenced
in Section 10(c)(i) shall be payable as a lump-sum payment within five days
after termination of employment if and to the extent that (A) the separate
payment constitutes short-term deferral under Treasury Regulation §
1.409A-1(b)(4), (B) the amount of the separate payment not covered by Section
10(c)(ii)(A) can be paid under the "two-year/two-times" exclusion from being a
deferral of compensation under Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii),
after first applying such exclusion under Section 10(b)(ii), (C) the separate
payment is covered by any other applicable exclusion or exemption under
Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(b)(9) (provided that the exclusion under
subsection (b)(9)(v)(D) shall be used only to the extent not relied upon for
other payments or benefits) and (D), the six-month delay rule in Section 10(d)

 



      
 

 



 

does not apply to the separate payment (except as otherwise provided in
Section 10(c)(iii)). Any other such separate payment (i.e., amounts subject
to the six-month delay rule) shall be subject to the six-month delay rule of
Section 10(d), subject to Section 10(c) (iii). Any delay in payment under the
six-month delay rule shall not limit Employees rights under this Agreement to
not forfeit a specified item of compensation as a result of Employees
termination.

 



 

(d) _Six-Month Delay Rule_.

 



 



 

(i) _General Rule_. The six-month delay rule will apply to certain payments
and benefits under the Agreement if all of the following conditions are met:

 



 

(A) Employee is a "key employee" (as defined in Code Section 416(i) without
regard to paragraph (10) thereof) for the year in which the termination
occurs. The Company will determine status of "key employees" annually, under
administrative procedures applicable to all Section 409A plans and
arrangements and applied in accordance with Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(i).

 



 

(B) The Companys stock is publicly traded on an established securities market
or otherwise.

 



 

(C) The payment or benefit in question is a deferral of compensation and not
excepted, exempted or excluded from being such by the short-term deferral
rule, or the "two-years/two-times" rule in Treasury Regulation §
1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), or any other exception, exemption or exclusion; provided,
however, that the exclusion under Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v)(D)
shall apply only if and to the extent that it is not necessary to apply to any
other payment or benefit payable within six months after Employees
termination.

 



 

(ii) _Effect of Rule_. If it applies, the six-month delay rule will delay a
payment or benefit which otherwise would be payable under this Agreement
within six months after Employees separation from service.

 



 

(A) Any delayed payment or benefit shall be paid on the date six months after
Employees separation from service.

 



 

(B) During the six-month delay period, accelerated payment will occur in the
event of the Employees death but not for any other reason (including no
acceleration upon a change in control), except for accelerations expressly
permitted under Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1  1.409A-6.

 



 

(C) Any payment that is not triggered by a termination, or is triggered by a
termination but would be made more than six months after the termination
(without applying this six-month delay rule), or would be payable at a fixed

 



      
 

 



 

date not tied to termination that is earlier than the expiration of the six-
month delay period, shall be unaffected by the six-month delay rule.

 



 

(iii) _Limit to Application of Six-Month Delay Rule_. If the terms of this
Agreement or other plan or arrangement or document relating to this Agreement
or payments hereunder impose this six-month delay rule in circumstances in
which it is not required for compliance with Section 409A, those terms shall
not be given effect.

 



 

(e) _Other Provisions_.

 



 

(i) _Interest on Delayed Payments_. If any payment is delayed by application
of the six-month delay rule under Section 10(d) or a delay resulting from the
application of Section 10(b)(iii) or 10(c)(iii), interest will accrue on such
unpaid amount at a rate equal to the short-term applicable federal rate (with
semiannual compounding) established by the Internal Revenue Service under
Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code and in effect at the date
the amount would have been paid but for the six-month delay rule hereunder.

 



 

(ii) _Good Reason_. The rules governing constructive termination not for
cause are intended to qualify such a termination as an "involuntary
separation" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(n)(2)(i), and
shall be so construed and interpreted.

 



 

(iii) _Non-transferability_. No right to any payment or benefit under this
Agreement shall be subject to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer,
assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment, or garnishment by Employees
creditors or of any of Employees beneficiaries.

 



 

(iv) _No Acceleration_. The timing of payments and benefits under the
Agreement may not be accelerated to occur before the time specified for
payment hereunder, except to the extent permitted under Treasury Regulation §
1.409A-3(j)(4) or as otherwise permitted under Code Section 409A without
Employee incurring a tax penalty.

 



 

(v) _Timing Relating to Release._ Other provisions of this Agreement
(including this Section 10) notwithstanding, if Employee is obligated to
execute a release, non-competition, or other agreement as a condition to
receipt of a payment hereunder, the Company will supply to Employee a form of
such release or other document not later than the date of Employees
termination, which must be returned within the time period required by law (or
21 days if no period is specified by law) and must not be revoked by Employee
within the applicable time period in order for Employee to satisfy any such
condition. To the extent that any severance payments are deferred
compensation under Section 409A, and are not otherwise exempt from the
application of Section 409A, then, if the period during which Employee may
consider and sign the severance agreement

 



      
 

 



 

spans two calendar years, the payment of severance will not be made or begin
until the later calendar year.

 



 

(vi) _Definition of Termination of Employment_. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "termination of employment" shall mean a separation from
service as defined in Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(h).

 



 

 **11.** **_Remedies_.** Employer or its controlled subsidiaries or
affiliates will be entitled to appropriate equitable relief, including, but
not limited to, a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction,
without the necessity of posting a bond. Employee will also be entitled to
seek equitable relief against Employer in connection with enforcement of the
covenants and obligations set forth in Sections 7, 8 and 9. The provisions of
Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 will survive the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the terms set forth in each Section.

 



      
 

 



 

 **13.** **_Notices_.** Any notice or request required or permitted
to be given to any party will be given in writing and, excepting personal

Exhibit A

 



 

 ** _FORM OF CONFIDENTIAL SEVERANCE AGREEMENT AND RELEASE_**

 



 

The following sets forth the Severance Agreement and Release ("Severance
Agreement") between Magellan Health, Inc. ("Magellan" or "Employer") and [
] ("Employee").

 



 

In consideration of the following obligations contained herein, the parties
agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Separation Pay._ Employees employment will terminate on [ ] ("Termination Date") in accordance with Section 6(c) of the Employment Agreement between Magellan and Employee executed on [ ] (the "Employment Agreement"). Magellan will pay Employee separation pay in an amount equal to $[ ], less all lawful deductions. The separation pay will be paid out in equal installments on a semi-monthly basis beginning on the next regular payday following the later of the Termination Date or the Effective Date (explained in Paragraph 21 below) and according to Magellans normal payroll policy and practices for the period [ ] through [ ] (the "Severance Period").

 



 

2. _Bonus._ In accordance with Section 6(c) of the Employment Agreement, Magellan has determined that Employee will not receive a pro-rata bonus for calendar year [ ].

 



 

[Or, if Magellan elects to pay a pro-rata bonus:

 



 

 _Bonus._ Employee shall be eligible to receive, on a pro-rata basis, a bonus
for the [ ] performance year in the amount that Employee would have
earned under the terms of Magellans [ ] Incentive Compensation
Program ("ICP") if Employee had been employed for the full calendar year
determined in accordance with, and subject to the conditions of, Section 6(c)
of the Employment Agreement.]

 



 

3. _Employment Benefits._ Through Employees Termination Date, Employee will receive all employment benefits for which Employee is eligible pursuant to and in accordance with Employers company policies and as required by law. Following Employees Termination Date, Employee will receive a payment for all accrued but unused Paid Time Off pursuant to and in accordance with Employers company policies, the Employment Agreement, and as required by law.

 



 

4. _EAP Services._ Employee may continue to access Employee Assistance Program services during the Severance Period by calling 1-866-266-2376.

 



 

5. _COBRA Payments._ If Employee elects COBRA coverage, he/she will be required to pay only the employee contribution rate for the health insurance portion of the COBRA coverage during the Severance Period. Dental and vision coverage under COBRA will be billed at the rate set forth in the Employment Agreement or, if not specified in the Employment Agreement, at 102% of the full COBRA rate. Employer complies with all applicable COBRA continuation health coverage laws.

 



 

6. _General Release of All Claims._ In consideration for the payments described in Paragraph 1 [or "the payments described in Paragraphs 1 and 2" if a bonus is paid] and the other benefits provided for in this Severance Agreement, which are in excess of the compensation

      
 

 



 

and benefits that Employee would normally receive upon his termination from
Magellan, Employee hereby releases Magellan from any and all claims, demands,
actions, suits, injuries, damages, or liabilities that Employee had, has, or
may have against Magellan, known or unknown, from the beginning of time up to
the later of the Effective Date of this Severance Agreement or the Termination
Date, excepting only those claims, if any, which Employee is prohibited by law
from waiving. This release includes, but is not limited to, a release of all
claims under the Employment Agreement, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the
Employment Retirement Insurance Security Act, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Family and Medical Leave
Act, the Equal Pay Act, and all other federal, state, and local laws related
to employment practices or otherwise.

 



 

However, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Severance Agreement
shall be construed to waive any right that is not subject to waiver by private
agreement, including, without limitation, any claims arising under state

federal, state, or local administrative agency or participating in any
investigation or proceeding conducted by such administrative agencies or from
reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to

 



      
 

 



 

any governmental agency or entity including but not limited to the Department
of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Congress, and any
Inspector General, or making other disclosures that are protected under the
whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation. Employee does not need
Magellans prior authorization to make any such charges, complaints, reports
or disclosures and Employee is not required to notify Magellan that he/she has
made such reports or disclosures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee
agrees to waive Employees right to recover individual relief in any charge,
complaint, report or lawsuit filed by Employee or anyone on Employees behalf.

assist in the defense of any such matter as required by Magellan or its
counsel, provided that Magellan pays Employee for his/her reasonable expenses

current verifiable salary or, if not employed, Employees prorated last
Magellan salary.

 



 

10. _Return of Company Property._ Employee agrees that, within two (2) days of the Termination Date, he/she will return to Magellan all property of Magellan that he/she has in his/her possession and any documents, records, or information appearing on any medium which contain things of any nature pertaining to his/her work at Magellan or any of its affiliate or subsidiary corporations in accordance with Section 9 of the Employment Agreement.

current or former employees, prospective employers, or any other third parties
regarding a current or former employee are limited to the employees dates of
employment and the positions held. Any agent or employee of Magellan who
provides a job reference that is not limited to the employees dates of
employment and positions held does so in his or her individual capacity and is
acting outside the scope of his or her authority and responsibilities.

 



 

13. _Confidentiality._ The parties agree that Magellan desires to keep this Severance Agreement confidential. Employee agrees that he/she will not publicize, discuss, or reveal the existence of this Severance Agreement or its terms to anyone not a party to the Agreement, other than his/her spouse (if any) or his/her personal medical, legal, and financial advisors, or unless required by court order. The persons that Employee is prohibited from disclosing the existence or terms of this Severance Agreement include, but are not limited to, the news media and any current or former Magellan employees.

16. _Entire Agreement._ The provisions included in this Severance Agreement constitute the entire agreement between Employee and Magellan and supersede any other existing agreement(s) between Employee and Magellan and/or its current and past affiliate or subsidiary companies with respect to its subject matter, excluding only the Employment Agreement, any other fully executed Non-Compete/Non-Solicit and Confidentiality Agreement and/or Employment Agreement that Employee has with Magellan, and any agreement between Magellan and Employee relating to the grant of stock options or restricted stock units to Employee, the terms of which shall remain in effect notwithstanding the existence of this Severance Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Severance Agreement and any of the excluded agreements referenced in the prior sentence, the terms of this Severance Agreement shall govern.

provisions shall not be effected thereby and said illegal, unenforceable, or
invalid term, part or provision shall be deemed not to be a part of this
Severance Agreement. If Paragraph 6 and/or Paragraph 7 of this Severance
Agreement are declared or determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable,
in whole or in part, the parties agree to replace the invalid or unenforceable
portion through good faith negotiations with valid and enforceable provisions
consistent with the intent of Paragraphs 6 and 7.

Employee will then have seven (7) days following his/her signing of the Severance Agreement to revoke it, in which case the Severance Agreement will not be effective and Employee will not be entitled to receive the payments and other benefits described in this Severance Agreement, including without limitation the payments described in Paragraph 1 [or "the payments described in Paragraphs 1 and 2" if a bonus is paid]. Employee understands that he/she will not receive any payment under the Severance Agreement until the revocation period has passed. Employee must submit notice of revocation in writing to Nicole Amling, VP Human Resources, at naamling@magellanhealth.com, delivered on or before the expiration of the revocation period.

 **Exhibit 7.2(g)(ii)**

 



 

 ** _FORM OF NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT_**

 



 

 **THIS NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT** ("Agreement") is made
and entered into by and between [*], an individual ("Seller")(1), and Magellan
Health, Inc., a Delaware corporation, on behalf of itself and its present and
future subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively referred to herein as
"Magellan").

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , reference is made to that certain Share Purchase Agreement (the
"Purchase Agreement"), dated as of the date hereof, by and among Magellan,
Magellan Healthcare, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Purchaser"), Armed Forces
Services Corporation, a Virginia corporation ("AFSC") and the sellers party
thereto, pursuant to which Purchaser will purchase all of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of AFSC from the sellers (the "Sale"), with the result
that AFSC will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Seller is a Seller under the Purchase Agreement;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Seller has detailed knowledge of competitively sensitive and
important confidential information and trade secrets of AFSC and its business,
including information regarding AFSCs plans and relationships with its
customers, suppliers and others, and has obtained and may in the future obtain
similar information and trade secrets concerning Magellans businesses; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Seller further recognizes Magellans interests in protecting,
among other things, Magellans relationships with its employees, customers,
suppliers and others, and the goodwill associated with its ongoing business;

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing recitals and of the
mutual covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties agree
as follows:

 



 

 ** _STATEMENT OF AGREEMENT_**

 



 

 **1.** ** _Protection of Confidential Information/Non-
Competition/Non-Solicitation_**.

 



 

Seller covenants and agrees as follows:

 



 

(a)(i) Confidential Information: From and after the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (the "Sale Closing"),
Seller agrees not to use or disclose, directly or indirectly, for any reason
whatsoever or in any way, other than after receipt of the prior written
consent of Magellan, any Confidential Information of AFSC or Magellan that is
known by Seller as of the Sale Closing or subsequently comes into his or her
knowledge. The obligation not to use or disclose any Confidential Information
will not apply to any Confidential Information that is or becomes public
knowledge through no fault of Seller, and that may be utilized by the public
without any direct or indirect obligation to Magellan, but the termination of

  (1) _Note to Draft_ : To be signed by all Sellers, except Sarah Kim.

      
 

 



 

the obligation for non use or nondisclosure by reason of such information
becoming public will extend only from the date such information becomes public
knowledge. The above will be without prejudice to any additional rights or
remedies of Magellan under any state or federal law regarding the protection
of trade secrets or other information.

 



 

(a)(ii) _Trade Secrets._ Seller shall hold in confidence all Trade
Secrets of AFSC or Magellan, that are known by Seller as of the Sale Closing
or subsequently come into his or her knowledge and shall not disclose, publish
or make use of at any time after the date hereof such Trade Secrets, other
than at the direction of Magellan, for as long as the information remains a
Trade Secret.

 



 

(a)(iii) For purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions apply:

 



 

"Confidential Information" means any data or information, other than Trade
Secrets, that is valuable to AFSC or Magellan and not generally known to the
public or to competitors of AFSC or Magellan. It is understood that the term
"Confidential Information" does not mean and shall not include information
which:

 



 

(a) is or subsequently becomes publicly available, except by reason of a
breach of Sellers obligation under this Agreement;

 



 

(b) is or becomes subsequently known to Seller without, to the knowledge of
Seller, the breach of any obligation owed to Magellan;

 



 

(c) is disclosed with the prior written approval of Magellan; or

 



 

(d) is obligated to be produced under order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or a valid administrative, congressional, or other subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process; provided, however, that upon
issuance of any such order, subpoena, demand or other process, Seller shall
promptly notify Magellan and shall provide Magellan with an opportunity (if
then available) to contest, at Magellans expense, the propriety of such order
or subpoena (or to arrange for appropriate safeguards against any further
disclosure by the court or administrative or congressional body seeking to
compel disclosure of such Confidential Information).

 



 

"Trade Secret" means information including, but not limited to, any technical
or non-technical data, formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method,
technique, drawing, process, financial data, financial plan, product plan,
list of actual or potential customers or suppliers or other information
similar to any of the foregoing, which (i) derives economic value, actual or
potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily
ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can derive economic value
from its disclosure or use; and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are
reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.

 



 

(a)(iv) _Interpretation._ The restrictions stated in paragraphs 1(a)(i) and
1(a)(ii) are in addition to and not in lieu of protections afforded to trade
secrets and confidential information

 



      
 

 



 

under applicable state law. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall
be interpreted as diminishing or otherwise limiting Magellans right under
applicable state law to protect its trade secrets and confidential
information. The foregoing restrictions will not be interpreted to prohibit
the use of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets in connection with Seller
asserting or defending Sellers rights in connection with a bona fide dispute
under the Purchase Agreement or this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Non-Competition_.

 



 

(i) Seller covenants and agrees that during the period of four (4) years
following the Sale Closing (the "Term"), he or she will not, on his or her own
behalf or as a partner, officer, director, employee, agent, or consultant of
any other person or entity, directly or indirectly, engage or attempt to
engage in a business that competes with the federal contracting business
conducted by AFSC as of the Sale Closing and the business planned to be
conducted by AFSC as of such time to the extent reflected in AFSCs pipeline
of active business prospects (the "Competing Business") unless waived in
writing by Magellan in its sole discretion. Seller recognizes that the
foregoing restriction is reasonable and necessary to protect the interest of
Magellan.

 



 

(ii) During the Term, Seller may submit a written request to Magellan
outlining a proposed employment or other business opportunity that Seller is
considering. Magellan will review such request, and make a determination
within ten (10) business days following receipt of such request, in its view,
as to whether the opportunity would constitute a breach of the foregoing non-
competition covenant.

 



 

(c) _Non-Solicitation_. To protect the goodwill of Magellan or the
customers of Magellan, Seller agrees that during the Term, he or she will not,
without the prior written permission of Magellan, directly or indirectly, for
himself or herself or on behalf of any other person or entity, solicit, divert
away, take away or attempt to solicit or take away any Customer for purposes
of providing or selling products or services that are a Competing Business, if
Magellan is then still engaged in the sale or provision of such products or
services at the time of the solicitation. For purposes of this Section 1(c),
"Customer" means any individual or entity to whom AFSC or Magellan had
provided, or contracted to provide, services and with whom Seller had, alone
or in conjunction with others, contact with or knowledge of. For purposes of
this section, Seller had contact with or knowledge of a Customer if (i) Seller
had business dealings with the customer on behalf of AFSC or Magellan; (ii)
Seller was responsible for supervising or coordinating the dealings between
the customer and AFSC or Magellan or; (iii) Seller obtained or had access to
trade secrets or confidential information about the Customer as a result of
Sellers association with AFSC or Magellan.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Non-Solicitation/Hiring of Employees_. During the Term, Seller
agrees that he or she will not, without the prior written permission of
Magellan, directly or indirectly, for himself or herself or on behalf of any
other person or entity, solicit for employment or hire any employee of AFSC or
Magellan during the Term.

 



 

 **2.** **_Remedies_**. An actual or threatened violation by
Seller of the covenants and obligations set forth in Section 1 will cause
irreparable harm to Magellan and that the remedy at law for any such violation
will be inadequate. Seller agrees, therefore, that Magellan will be entitled
to equitable relief against Seller in connection with enforcement of the
covenants and obligations set forth in Section 1.

 



 

 **3.** ** _Notices_**. Any notice or request required or
permitted to be given to any party will be given in writing and, excepting
personal delivery, will be given at the address set forth below or at such
other address as such party may designate by written notice to the other party

Reason has arisen, and such event or condition continues uncured for a period
of more than thirty (30) days after Purchaser gives notice thereof to the
Company.

 



 

(d) " _Securities Act_ " shall mean the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

 



 

(e) " _Transfer_ " shall mean, with respect to any Restricted
Shares, any sale, assignment, alienation, conveyance, gift, pledge, lien,
encumbrance, bequest by will or under intestacy laws or by operation of law or

(b) At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser

hereinafter provided, upon payment of the Purchase Price by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such account as shall be designated in writing

reasonably acceptable to the Company. Payment of the Purchase Price shall be
made in U.S. dollars.

 



 

4. _Vesting of Restricted Shares; Restrictions on Transfer._

 



 

(a) _Vesting of Restricted Shares_. One hundred percent of the
Restricted Shares (the " _Unvested Shares_ ") shall vest based on the passage
of time, with (x) one-half (1/2) vesting on the twelve (12) month anniversary
of the Closing Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) and (y) one-half
(1/2) vesting on the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the Closing Date.
In addition to the time-based vesting schedule set forth in the preceding
sentence, all Unvested Shares shall immediately vest upon the earliest to
occur of the date upon which (i) Purchaser dies, (ii) Purchasers employment
with the Company is terminated by reason of his becoming "Disabled" (as
defined in the form of employment agreement referred to in Section 7.2 of the
Purchase Agreement), (iii) Purchasers employment with the Company is
terminated by the Company without Cause (including by reason of the Companys
(or the Companys Affiliate) failure to renew the terms of any employment
agreement to which Purchaser is a party) or (iv) Purchasers employment with
the Company is terminated by Purchaser for Good Reason (as defined herein)
(provided that Purchasers service with the Company has not previously
terminated after the date hereof for any other reason). Upon each such time
as Unvested Shares vest pursuant to the preceding sentences, such shares shall
from and after such time be referred to as " _Vested Shares_ ". If
Purchasers employment with the Company (or an Affiliate (as defined in the
Purchase Agreement) of the Company) is terminated by Purchaser without Good
Reason (including by reason of Purchasers failure to renew the terms of any
employment agreement to which Purchaser is a party with the Company or any of
its Affiliates) or terminated by the Company for Cause, in each case, before
any portion of the Unvested Shares has vested pursuant to this _Section
4(a)_, then Purchaser shall immediately as of such time forfeit such Unvested
Shares to the Company and shall deliver any certificates representing such
forfeited shares, endorsed for transfer, to the Company for no consideration.

 



 

(b) _Transfers Generally Prohibited_. Without the prior written
consent of the Company (executed by an executive officer thereof), no Transfer
of any of the Unvested Shares shall be permitted. Vested Shares may be
Transferred subject to the Companys rights in subsection (d) below.

 



 

(c) _Certain Transfers Permitted_. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 4_, the Restricted Shares may be Transferred (i)
in the event of Purchasers death, by will or the laws of descent and
distribution or by a written beneficiary designation accepted by the Company,
(ii) by operation of law in connection with a merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, reclassification or exchange of shares of Common Stock,
reorganization or similar transaction involving the Company and affecting the
Common Stock generally or (iii) with the approval of the Company, to a member
of Purchasers family, or a trust primarily for the benefit of Purchaser
and/or one or more members of Purchasers family, or to a corporation,
partnership or other entity primarily for the benefit of Purchaser and/or one
or more such family members and/or trusts or (iv) with the approval of the
Company, in another estate or personal financial planning transaction;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in any such case the Restricted Shares so
Transferred shall remain subject in the hands of the Transferee to the
restrictions on Transfer provided hereby and all other terms hereof, including
those relating to vesting, if applicable.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Right of First Refusal_.

 



 

(i) If following the time Restricted Shares vest hereunder,
Purchaser desires to Transfer all or any portion of the Vested Shares, other
than pursuant to the provisions of subsection (c) above (the " _Offered
Shares_ "), then Purchaser shall first furnish a written notice of such
proposed Transfer to the Company setting forth the terms of the proposed
Transfer, including the amount and type of consideration to be paid by the
proposed transferee (the " _Transferee_ "), the terms and conditions of the
proposed Transfer and the name of the Transferee. Such written notice will be
deemed to be an offer to sell the Offered Shares to the Company (the " _Offer_
") for an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the Offered Shares.

 



 

(ii) The Company may elect to purchase all or some of the Offered
Shares by providing written notice to Purchaser of its election to purchase
within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Offer (the " _Notice Period_ ").
If the Company timely exercises its option to purchase the Offered Shares,
Purchaser shall sell the Offered Shares elected to be purchased to the
Company, and the Company shall purchase the Offered Shares elected to be
purchased and pay to Purchaser an amount in cash equal to the Fair Market
Value of the Offered Shares elected to be purchased at a closing to be held no
later than sixty (60) days after the Companys receipt of the Offer.

 



 

(iii) If the Company fails to exercise its option to purchase all of
the Offered Shares, then Purchaser shall have ninety (90) days after the
expiration of the Notice Period or the date upon which the Company notifies
Purchaser that it will not be purchasing the Offered Shares to sell the
Offered Shares not so elected to be purchased to the Transferee on the terms
and conditions specified in the Offer. If Purchaser does not consummate the
sale of such Offered Shares within such ninety (90)-day period, then Purchaser
may not thereafter Transfer any of the Restricted Shares without again
complying with this _Section 4(d)_.

 



 

(e) _Legend_. Purchaser acknowledges that the Company may legend
any certificates representing the Restricted Shares (or other shares or
securities distributed in respect thereof) with a legend in the form set forth
as _Exhibit B_ and enter appropriate stop-transfer instructions with any
transfer agent or registrar, as may reasonably be determined by the Company to
be appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 4_, including
any applicable federal or state securities law.

 



 

(f) _Securities Act Restrictions on Resale of Restricted Shares_.
Purchaser acknowledges that the issuance of the Restricted Shares to Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement has not been registered under the Securities Act or
any U.S. state law in reliance upon an exemption from such registration and
that the Restricted Shares may not be sold or otherwise Transferred absent
registration of such transaction or the availability of an exemption from
registration thereunder and, if requested by the Company, the delivery to the
Company of an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to the Company as to the availability of an exemption from registration
thereunder.

 



 

(g) _Fiduciary and Securities Law Restrictions_. Purchaser
acknowledges that, as an employee, officer and/or manager or director of AFSC
(or the Company or another of its Affiliates), Purchaser may be subject to
restrictions on his ability to sell or otherwise Transfer Restricted Shares by
reason of being a fiduciary for the Company or

 



      
 

 



 

by reason of federal or state securities laws and/or the policies regarding
transactions in securities of the Company from time to time adopted by the
Company and applicable to Purchaser. Nothing contained herein shall relieve
Purchaser of any restrictions on Transfer of Restricted Shares provided
thereby and any other restrictions of Transfer of Restricted Shares provided
herein shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other restrictions
provided thereby.

 



 

5. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. The Company hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

 



 

(a) _Organization and Good Standing_. The Company is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware
and has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business

hereto have been duly authorized and, when issued and delivered in
consideration of the payment of the Purchase Price, will be validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable and, except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, are entitled to all of the rights and privileges of validly issued and
outstanding shares of the Companys Common Stock. The Company has full
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and all
other agreements and instruments contemplated hereby to which the Company is a
party and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and this
Agreement and all such other agreements and instruments have been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
execution and delivery of this Agreement and all other agreements and
instruments contemplated hereby to which the Company is a party, by the other
parties hereof and thereof, are valid, binding and enforceable against the
Company in accordance with their terms, except that such enforceability (i)
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar laws of general application affecting or relating
to the enforcement of creditors rights generally and (ii) is subject to
general principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding at law or in
equity.

 



 

(c) _Compliance with Law and Other Obligations_. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company, and the fulfillment
of and compliance with the terms hereof by the Company, do not and will not
(i) violate any statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation or order of any
court or governmental authority or any judgment, order or decree (U.S.
federal, state or local or foreign) applicable to the Company, (ii) violate
any requirements of any material obligation of the Company, (iii) result in or
constitute (with or without the giving of notice, lapse of time or both) any
default or event of default under any material obligation of the Company, or
give rise to a right of termination of, or accelerate the performance required
by, any terms of any such material obligation.

 



 

6. _Representations and Warranties of Purchaser_. Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to the Company that:

 



 

(a) _Authorization and Enforceability_. Purchaser has full right,
capacity and power to execute and deliver this Agreement and all other
agreements and instruments contemplated hereby to which Purchaser is a party,
and to perform his obligations hereunder and thereunder. This Agreement and
all other agreements and instruments

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated hereby to which Purchaser is a party have been duly executed and
delivered by or on behalf of such Purchaser and, assuming due execution by
other parties, constitute legal, valid and binding agreements, enforceable
against Purchaser in accordance with their terms, except that such
enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general
application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors rights
generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity, whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity.

 



 

(b) _Compliance with Law and Other Obligations_. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and all other agreements and
instruments contemplated hereby to which such Purchaser is a party and the
fulfillment of and compliance with the respective terms hereof and thereof by
Purchaser, do not and will not (i) violate any statute, law ordinance, rule,
regulation or order of any court or governmental authority or any judgment,
order or decree (U.S. federal, state or local or foreign) applicable to
Purchaser, (ii) violate any requirements of any material obligation of
Purchaser, or (ii) result in or constitute (with or without the giving of
notice, lapse of time or both) any default or event of default under any
material obligation of Purchaser, or give rise to a right of termination of,
or accelerate the performance required by, any terms of any such material
obligation.

 



 

(c) _Investment Intent; Accredited Investor Status; Sufficiency of
Information_. The Restricted Shares to be received by Purchaser will be
acquired by Purchaser for investment only for his own account, not as a
nominee or agent, and not with a view to the sale or distribution of any part
thereof in violation of applicable U.S. federal or state or foreign securities
laws. Purchaser has no current intention of selling, granting any
participation in or otherwise distributing the Restricted Shares in violation
of applicable U.S. federal or state or foreign securities laws. Purchaser
does not have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any
person or entity to sell, transfer or grant any participation to such person
or entity, or to any third person or entity, with respect to any of the
Restricted Shares, in each case, in violation of applicable U.S. federal or
state or foreign securities laws. Purchaser is one of the following and
therefore an "accredited investor," as such term is defined in Rule 501 of the
Securities Act: (i) a person whose individual net worth, or joint net worth
with their spouse, at the time of purchasing the Restricted Shares exceeds
$1,000,000 or (ii) a person who had an individual income in excess of $200,000
in each of the two most recent years or joint income with their spouse in
excess of $300,000 in each of those years and has a reasonable expectation of
reaching the same income level in the current year. Purchaser, alone or
together with his advisors, has such knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of
investing in the Restricted Shares pursuant hereto. In deciding to invest in
the Restricted Shares Purchaser has relied upon independent investigations
made by Purchaser and, to the extent believed by Purchaser to be appropriate,
Purchasers representatives, including Purchasers own professional, tax and
other advisors, and is making an independent decision to invest in the Shares.
Purchaser has been furnished with such documents, materials and information as
Purchaser deems necessary or appropriate for evaluating an investment in the
Restricted Shares, and Purchaser has considered such documents, materials and
information and understands and has evaluated the types of risks involved in a
purchase of the Restricted Shares. Purchaser has had, prior to his purchase
of the Restricted Shares, the opportunity to ask questions of, and receive
answers from, the Company concerning the terms and conditions of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and Purchasers investment in the
Restricted Shares and to obtain additional information necessary to verify the

 



      
 

 



 

accuracy of any information furnished to him or her or to which he or she had
access. Purchaser has not relied upon any representations or other
information (whether oral or written) from the Company or its respective
stockholders, directors, officers or Affiliates, or from any other person or
entity, in connection with his investment in the Restricted Shares, except for
the representations explicitly included herein. Purchaser acknowledges that
the Company has not given any assurances with respect to the tax consequences
of Purchasers acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Restricted
Shares.

 



 

7. _Conditions to Obligations of the Company and Purchaser_.

 



 

(a) Upon a termination of the Purchase Agreement in accordance with
its terms before consummation of the Sale Closing, this Agreement shall
automatically terminate, and be of no further force or effect.

 



 

(b) Purchaser hereby agrees to make, as of the Closing, an election
with the Internal Revenue Service under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (a "
_Section 83(b) Election_") with respect to the Restricted Shares, and
Purchaser hereby authorizes the Company to timely file such election with the
Internal Revenue Service on Purchasers behalf. The form for making the
Section 83(b) Election is attached hereto as _Exhibit C_. The Company and
Purchaser shall each be provided a copy of the Section 83(b) Election.

 



 

8. _Additional Shares_. In the event that the Company issues any additional shares of its capital stock or other securities in exchange for or with respect to Restricted Shares at a time when such Restricted Shares are not Transferable in accordance with _Section 4(b)_, whether by way of a stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, or other transaction, the new or additional shares held by or issuable to Purchaser as a result thereof shall be treated as "Restricted Shares" for the purposes of this Agreement and shall be subject to the same restrictions and other terms (including terms of forfeiture) of this Agreement as are applicable to the initial Restricted Shares.

 



 

9. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same Agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties (including by facsimile or via portable document format (.pdf)).

 



 

10. _No Waiver, Modifications in Writing_. This Agreement and any exhibits, schedules or other documents referred to herein or therein, sets forth the entire understanding of the parties, and supersedes all prior agreements, arrangements, term sheets, presentations and communications, whether oral or written, with respect to the specific subject matter hereof. No waiver of or consent to any departure from any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless signed in writing by the party entitled to the benefit thereof; _provided_ that notice of any such waiver shall be given to each party hereto as set forth below. Except as otherwise provided herein, no amendment, modification or termination of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless signed in writing by or on behalf of the Company and Purchaser. Any amendment, supplement or modification of or to any provision of this Agreement, any waiver of any provision of this Agreement, and any consent to any departure from the terms of any

 



      
 

 



 

provision of this Agreement, shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the specific purpose for which made or given.

 



 

11. _Binding Effect; Assignment_. The rights and obligations of each party under this Agreement may not be assigned to any other person or entity. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any right or benefit upon any person or entity other than the parties to this Agreement, and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company, Purchaser and its respective heirs, successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns.

 



 

12. _Severability of Provisions_. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

13. _Injunctive Relief_. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby acknowledges that in the event of a breach by any of them of any material provision of this Agreement, the aggrieved party may be without an adequate remedy at law. Each of the parties therefore agrees that, in the event of a breach of any material provision of this Agreement, the aggrieved party may elect to institute and prosecute proceedings to enforce specific performance or to enjoin the continuing breach of such provision, as well as to obtain damages for breach of this Agreement. By seeking or obtaining any such relief, the aggrieved party will not be precluded from seeking or obtaining any other relief to which it may be entitled.

 



 

14. _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given, made, served or delivered if delivered personally, sent by facsimile (receipt of which is confirmed), sent by electronic mail or sent by overnight courier (providing proof of delivery) to the parties at the following addresses:
