conversion to the JeanieÂ® system (including, without limitation, the cost of
all card reissue, signage and penalties relating to terminating its current
EFT relationships) will be paid by Acquiror, including the reasonable cost of
necessary personnel that need to be hired. Acquiror further agrees that the
costs and fees to Crown Bank for the JeanieÂ® service shall not exceed those
charged by the current EFT service provider of Crown Bank, subject to any
increases in such costs and fees which would otherwise be permitted under
their current EFT processing agreements. In the event this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 7.01 hereof for any reason except a material
breach or default by RGF, RAC or Crown Bank, and if, in such instance, Crown
Bank desires to convert to another provider of EFT services, Acquiror shall
pay all costs and expenses associated with such conversion, provided, however,
such costs and expenses are reasonable when compared to costs and
expenses ordinarily charged in the EFT services industry. In no event shall
Crown Bank be required to take any actions pursuant to this Section 3.05 or
otherwise under this Agreement that are contrary to any applicable law,
regulation, rule or order or which constitute a breach of the fiduciary
duties of the directors of Crown Bank.

_3.06_ _Referral Agreement_. Simultaneous with the execution of this
Agreement, Acquiror and Crown Bank shall enter into the Referral Agreement
attached hereto as _Exhibit C._ Such Referral Agreement shall be an arms-

Acquiror a schedule, attached hereto and made a part hereof (the "Disclosure
Schedule") setting forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is
necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more
representations or warranties contained in Section 4.03 or 4.04 or to one or
more of its covenants contained in Article III, provided, however, the mere
inclusion of an item in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by a party that
such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or
that, absent such inclusion in the Disclosure Schedule, such item is or would
be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

_4.02_ _Standard_. Solely for purposes of determining whether the condition
set forth in Section 6.02(a) or 6.03(a), as the case may be, has been
satisfied (and without otherwise qualifying any representation or warranty
made on the date hereof), no representation or warranty of RGF, RAC or
Crown Bank, on the one hand, or Acquiror, on the other hand, contained in
Sections 4.03 or 4.04, respectively, shall be deemed untrue or incorrect for
purposes of Sections 6.02(a) or 6.03(a), and no party hereto shall be deemed
to have breached a representation or warranty for purposes of such Sections,
disregarding all qualifiers and exceptions relating to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect, (i) as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) as of the
Closing Date, except to the extent such representations and warranties speak
as of an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall
have been true and correct as of such earlier date, as a consequence of the
existence of any fact, event or circumstance unless such fact, circumstance
or event, individually or taken together with all other facts, events or
circumstances inconsistent with any representation or warranty contained in
Sections 4.03 or 4.04, has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the party making such representation or warranty.

_4.03_ _Representations and Warranties of RGF, RAC and Crown Bank_. Subject
to Sections 4.01 and 4.02, RGF, RAC and Crown Bank hereby represent and

leasing of property or assets or the conduct of its business requires it to be
so licensed or qualified, except where the failure to be so licensed or

Adverse Effect on Crown Bank. Crown Bank has in effect all federal, state,
local and foreign governmental authorizations necessary for it to own or lease
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. The
deposit accounts of Crown Bank are insured by the FDIC, in the manner and to

Crown Bank Board of Directors) through the date hereof.

(b) _Jurisdictions_. A list of all jurisdictions in which Crown Bank is
qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation has
been Previously Disclosed, and such jurisdictions are the only jurisdictions
in which the nature of the activities conducted by Crown Bank or the character

and where the failure to so qualify would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Crown Bank.

(c) _Crown Bank Capital Stock_. The authorized capital stock of Crown Bank
consists solely of (i) 5,000,000 shares of Crown Bank Common Stock, of which
2,016,071 shares were issued and outstanding as of the date hereof and owned
by RAC and (ii) 200,000 shares of Crown Bank Preferred Stock, of which none
were issued and outstanding as of the date hereof. The Crown Bank Preferred

Bank or otherwise directly or indirectly owned by Crown Bank. The outstanding
shares of Crown Bank Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid and non-assessable, and none of the outstanding shares of
Crown Bank Common Stock have been issued in violation of the preemptive rights
of any Person. There are no shares of Crown Bank Common Stock or Crown Bank
Preferred Stock reserved for issuance, Crown Bank does not have any Rights
issued or outstanding with respect to Crown Bank Common Stock or Preferred
Stock and Crown Bank does not have any commitment to authorize, issue or sell
any Crown Bank Common Stock or Crown Bank Preferred Stock or Rights, except

for the conversion into Crown Bank Preferred Stock under limited
circumstances. No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the

outstanding.

obligation of each of RGF, RAC and Crown Bank, enforceable in accordance with
its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,

of general applicability relating to or affecting creditorsÂ’ rights or by

filings and registrations referred to in the preceding paragraph and the
expiration of related waiting periods, the execution, delivery

or license, or agreement, indenture or instrument of RGF, RAC or Crown Bank or

was a member prior to the Closing Date, for any taxable year, or (z) imposed
as a result of or attributable to the Section 338(h)(10) Election described
herein. Prior to the due date for filing any Tax Returns for periods prior to
the Closing Date other than Crown BankÂ’s final federal and state income tax
returns, as described below, RAC shall make available to Acquiror a draft of
such Tax Returns. Acquiror  



 

40  shall have the opportunity to review and comment on the draft of such Tax
Returns. RAC also will prepare or cause to be prepared Crown BankÂ’s
final federal and state income tax returns for the period through the Closing
Date and will make available to Acquiror drafts of such returns for its and
his review and approval prior to filing (which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). RAC shall reimburse Acquiror upon demand
for any Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods paid by Acquiror to the
extent they exceed the reserve for Tax liability (excluding any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect temporary differences between book and
Tax income).

(ii) Acquiror shall prepare and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns that
are required to be filed by or with respect to Crown Bank for taxable years
or periods ending after the Closing Date other than Tax Returns with respect
to a taxable period for which a consolidated, unitary or combined income Tax
Return of RAC will include the operation of Crown Bank and shall remit any
Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. With respect to any Tax Return that
covers a taxable year or period beginning before and ending after the Closing
Date, Acquiror shall provide a copy of such Tax Return to RAC at least 30
days prior to the due date (including applicable extensions) for the filing
thereof, and RAC shall have the right to approve (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) such Tax Return to the extent
that it relates to the portion of the taxable year or period ending on the
Closing Date. RAC shall pay Acquiror the amount of any Taxes for which RAC is
liable pursuant to Section 5.06(a) but which are payable with Tax Returns to
be filed by Acquiror pursuant to this Section 5.06(b)(ii) within ten days
prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Returns.

(iii) Acquiror shall be liable for and shall pay all Taxes of Crown Bank for
any Post-Closing Tax Period. Acquiror shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes
of Acquiror or Crown Bank (net of Taxes payable by Acquiror or Crown Bank
thereon) received in respect of any Post-Closing Tax Period.

(iv) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date (the "Straddle Period"), the amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income or gross receipts of Crown Bank for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period portion of the Straddle Period shall be based on an interim closing of
the books as of the close of business of the Closing Date and the amount of
other Taxes of Crown Bank for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire taxable period, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Taxable Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

(v) Acquiror shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes paid by Crown Bank,
computed using the separate taxable income rules of Treas. Reg.
Sec. 1.1502-12, to the extent attributable to the carry back or carry forward
of a net operating loss or any other carry back or carry forward of any other
tax attribute of Crown Bank arising in its final tax year or any prior tax
year, also as computed using the separate taxable income rules of Treas. Reg.
Sec. 1.1502-12.



 

41 (vi) Any payment by Acquiror to RAC, or by RAC to Acquiror, pursuant to this
Section 5.06(a) (other than interest payments) shall be treated by the
parties as an adjustment to the Transaction Consideration paid to or received
by RAC, as the case may be.

(vii) RAC and RGF, on the one hand, and Acquiror, on the other hand, shall
each pay one-half of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and similar taxes arising from the sale of the shares of
Crown Bank Common Stock.

(viii) Each party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and
expenses, including reasonable costs and expenses of counsel, incurred to
enforce the other partyÂ’s obligations under this Section 5.06.

(b) _Contest Provision_. Acquiror shall promptly (and in any event within 15
Business Days) notify RAC in writing upon receipt by Acquiror or Crown Bank
(following its acquisition by Acquiror) of notice of any pending or threatened
federal, state, local or foreign audits or assessments relating to Taxes
which may materially affect the Tax liabilities of Crown Bank for which RAC
would be required to pay pursuant to Section 5.06(a), and RAC shall promptly
(and in any event within 15 Business Days) notify Acquiror in writing upon
receipt by RAC or any of its Affiliates of notice of any pending or threatened
federal, state, local or foreign audits or assessments relating to Taxes which
may materially affect the Tax liabilities of Crown Bank for which Acquiror
would be required to pay pursuant to Section 5.06(a); provided, that no
failure or delay in giving any notice required by this sentence shall relieve
Acquiror or RAC of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the
extent that Acquiror or RAC demonstrates that it is prejudiced by such
failure to give, or delay in giving, such notice. RAC shall have the sole
right to represent Crown BankÂ’s interests in any audit or administrative or
court proceeding relating to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date, and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense; provided, that
Acquiror shall be given notice of, and have the right to monitor all
proceedings and to review in advance and comment on all submissions made by
RAC in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, RAC shall not be
entitled to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any claim for Taxes which would adversely affect the liability
for Taxes of Acquiror or Crown Bank (following its acquisition by Acquiror)
for any period after the Closing Date to any extent (including the imposition
of income tax deficiencies, the reduction of asset basis or cost adjustments,
the lengthening of any amortization or depreciation periods, the denial of
amortization or depreciation deductions, or the reduction of loss or credit
carry forwards) without the prior written consent of Acquiror.

(c) _Cooperation; Tax Records_.

(i) After the Closing Date, RAC and Acquiror shall:

(A) assist (and cause their respective Affiliates to assist) the other party
as necessary in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party is
responsible for preparing and filing;



 

42 (B) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with Tax
authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of Crown Bank and in administering
this Agreement;

(C) make available to the other party and to any Tax authority as
reasonably requested all books and records, documents, financial, operating
and accounting data and other information relating to Taxes of Crown Bank;

(D) provide timely notice to the other party in writing of any pending or
threatened audits or assessments of Crown Bank for taxable periods for which
the other party may have a liability; and

(E) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence received from
any Tax authority in connection with any Tax audit or information
request with respect to any such taxable period.

(ii) Each of RAC, Acquiror and Crown Bank shall retain or cause to be retained
all Tax Returns, schedules, workpapers, and all material books and records or
other documents relating thereto, until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (including any waivers or extensions thereof) for the
taxable years to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate or as
otherwise required by any record retention agreement with any Tax authority
that relates to Crown Bank.

(d) _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

(i) RAC shall join with Acquiror in making an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code and, at the request of Acquiror, any analogous
provision of state or local law (each such election, a "Section 338(h)(10)
Election") with respect to the Purchase by Acquiror of the Crown Bank
Common Stock. RGF, RAC and Crown Bank shall not take, and shall use their
best efforts not to allow, any action that would result in their inability to
make a valid 338(h)(10) Election. RAC shall pay any Tax imposed attributable
to the making of the 338(h)(10) Election, including (i) any tax imposed under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(5), (ii) any state, local or
foreign Tax imposed on Crown BankÂ’s gain, or (iii) any withholding tax
resulting from a Section 338(h)(10) Election or similar elections for state
income tax purposes, and RAC shall indemnify Acquiror and Crown Bank against
any monetary payment or loss arising out of any failure to pay any such Taxes.
At or prior to Closing, RAC will deliver to Acquiror an executed Form 8023,
Election Under Section 338 for Corporations Making Qualified Stock Purchases,
and such other forms as are necessary to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election
and similar elections for state income tax purposes on or before the Closing
Date. Acquiror shall timely file such elections.

(ii) Within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date, the parties shall mutually
work together in good faith to allow Acquiror to deliver to RGF and RAC a
schedule that allocates a mutually agreed upon fair market value of the assets
and proprietary rights of Crown Bank for all Tax purposes (the "Agreed
Value") to the assets of Crown Bank in accordance with Code Sections 338 and
1060 and the regulations thereunder. RGF and RAC agree to reasonably
cooperate, in good faith, with Acquiror to file all Tax Returns, including  



 

43  amended returns and claims for refund, IRS Form 8883 and any information
reports in a manner consistent with the schedule delivered by Acquiror. RGF
and RAC agree to act in accordance with such allocation in the course of any
Tax audit, Tax review or Tax litigation relating thereto and to take no
position inconsistent with the allocation for federal and state income tax
purposes. The Agreed Value shall be based upon the fair market value of the
assets and proprietary rights of Crown Bank as of the Closing.

_5.07_ _Certain Policies_. Prior to the Closing Date, Crown Bank shall,
consistent with GAAP, the rules and regulations of the SEC and applicable
banking laws and regulations, to the extent requested by Acquiror, modify or
change its loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation and real estate
valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of
reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of
Acquiror; provided, however, that no such modifications or changes need be
made prior to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01(a);
and further provided that in any event, no accrual or reserve made by Crown
Bank pursuant to this Section 5.07 shall constitute or be deemed to be a
breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of this Agreement or
otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or
failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of any such adjustments
shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of previously furnished
financial statements or information and shall not be construed as concurrence
of Crown Bank or its management with any such adjustments.

_5.08_ _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, RGF and RAC shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Acquiror, its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees and
affiliates (collectively the "Acquiring Parties"), from and against the
entirety of any charges, complaints, actions, suits, proceedings,
hearings, investigations, claims, demands, judgments, orders, decrees,
stipulations, injunctions, damages, dues, penalties, fines, costs, amounts
paid in settlement, liabilities, obligations, Taxes, Liens, losses, expenses,
and fees, including all reasonable attorneysÂ’, consultantsÂ’, expertsÂ’, audit
costs, and court costs (collectively, "Adverse Consequences") the Acquiring
Parties may suffer, sustain or become subject to, through and after the date
of the claim for indemnification, including any Adverse Consequences the
Acquiring Parties may suffer after the end of any applicable Survival Period
with respect to claims made within such period to the extent required by
Section 8.01 ("Acquiror Indemnifiable Losses"), resulting from, arising out
of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by:

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties of RGF,
RAC or Crown Bank set forth in this Agreement or in the Disclosure Schedules
or certificates delivered by RGF, RAC or Crown Bank in connection herewith,
including without limitation any Adverse Consequences attributable to Taxes,
Tax Returns, filings and information reporting affiliated with RGF, RAC or
Crown Bank or any Adverse Consequences after the Effective Time which are as a
result of Crown BankÂ’s removal from the Crown Bank Group and/or affiliation
with RGF and RAC prior to the Effective Time;



 

44 (ii) any Adverse Consequences associated with the Convertible Rights
Redemption or any failure by RAC to initiate or complete the Convertible
Rights Redemption; and

(iii) the cost and expense of defending any action, demand, or claim by
any third party against or affecting any Acquiring Parties arising from facts
or circumstances, which, if true or successful, would constitute a breach of
any of the representations, warranties or covenants of RGF, RAC or Crown Bank,
or would obligate Acquiror or cause Acquiror to be subject to any obligation,
liability or indebtedness referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) even if such
action, demand or claim ultimately proves to be untrue or unfounded, provided,
however, that the Acquiring Parties must have sought such indemnification in
good faith.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless RGF and RAC, their Affiliates and Subsidiaries and their
respective officers, directors, employees and affiliates (collectively the
"Selling Parties"), from and against any Adverse Consequences the Selling
Parties may suffer, sustain or become subject to, through and after the date
of the claim for indemnification, including any Adverse Consequences the
Selling Parties may suffer, after the end of any applicable Survival Period
with respect to claims made within such period to the extent required by
Section 8.01 ("Seller Indemnifiable Losses"), resulting from, arising out of,
relating to, in the nature of, or caused by:

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties of Acquiror
set forth in this Agreement or in the Disclosure Schedules or certificates
delivered by Acquiror in connection herewith;

(ii) the conduct of the business and operations of Crown Bank after
the Closing Date; and

(iii) the cost and expense of defending any action, demand, or claim by any
third party against or affecting the Selling Parties arising from facts or
circumstances, which, if true or successful, would constitute a breach of any
of the representations, warranties or covenants of Acquiror, or would obligate
RAC or RGF or cause RAC or RGF to be subject to any obligation, liability or
indebtedness referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) even if such action, demand
or claim ultimately proves to be untrue or unfounded, provided, however, that
the Selling Parties must have sought such indemnification in good faith.

(c) Any party wishing to claim indemnification ("Indemnified Party") under
this Section 5.08, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, shall promptly notify the other party ("Indemnifying
Party"), but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does
not actually prejudice the Indemnifying Party, provided, however, that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, an Indemnified
Party seeking to claim indemnification hereunder with respect to a claim
incurred by it must provide written notice to the Indemnifying Party of such
claim as provided in this Section 5.08 within the Survival Period set forth in
Section 8.01 for the  



 

45  representation or warranty that is the basis of such claim in order to be
entitled to Indemnification for the claim hereunder. In the event of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before
or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right
to assume the defense thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any
other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection
with the defense thereof, except that if the Indemnifying Party elects not to
assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Party advises that there
are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Parties that make joint representation inappropriate, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as
statements therefor are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any
jurisdiction), (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of
any such matter, and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent which shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

(d) Limitations on Indemnification.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
Indemnifying Party shall be liable to any Indemnified Parties pursuant
to this Section 5.08 unless the aggregate of all claims pursuant to this
Section 5.08 asserted by the Indemnified Parties for which the Indemnifying
Party would, but for this provision, be liable exceeds on a cumulative basis
an amount equal to Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000), in which
event the Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for the excess of such
claims over Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000).

(ii) Each indemnification claim shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds
actually received by the Indemnified Party, provided, however, that
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification with respect to
the amount of any indemnification claim that is in excess of the cash proceeds
actually received by such Indemnified Party (after deducting reasonable costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the recovery of such insurance
proceeds, including premium increases). If any Indemnified Party recovers from
an insurance company all or any part of any indemnification payments
previously paid to it by the Indemnifying Party (and even if such recovery
occurs after the expiration of the Survival Period set forth in Section 8.01),
the applicable Indemnified Party shall, within ten (10) Business Days, pay
over to the Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered up to the amount
previously paid by the Indemnifying Party.

(iii) Each indemnification claim shall be reduced by any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment payable to any Indemnified Party by any
third party with respect to such indemnification claim and, if any Indemnified
Party recovers from third parties all or any part of any indemnification
payments previously paid to it by the Indemnifying Party (and even if such
recovery occurs after the expiration of the Survival Period set forth in
Section 8.01), the applicable Indemnified Party shall, within ten (10)
Business Days, pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered up
to the amount previously paid by the Indemnifying Party.



 

46 (e) At the Closing, RAC and RGF shall cause the persons serving as directors
and officers of Crown Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the "Crown Directors") to be covered by the directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance policy maintained by RGF and/or RAC from and
after the Closing Date and shall indemnify and hold harmless Acquiror for any
liability, losses, fees or expenses Acquiror is subject as a result of any
action or inaction by one or more of the Crown Directors. Such policies shall
be of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions
which are in the aggregate not materially less advantageous than such policy
or single premium tail coverage with policy limits equal to RGFÂ’s and RACÂ’s
existing coverage limits with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time which were committed by such directors and officers in
their capacities as such. Acquiror shall not be required to maintain
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policy for the Crown Directors,
nor indemnify the Crown Directors for any losses.

(f) The provisions of this Section 5.08 are intended to be for the benefit of
and shall be enforceable by each of the Indemnified Parties and his or her
heirs.

_5.09_ _Benefit Plans_.

(a) Acquiror will offer or provide to any Crown Bank employee retained by
Acquiror or any Affiliate of Acquiror participation in employee benefit plans
and arrangements available for similarly situated employees of Acquiror or its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries (excluding the Fifth Third Master Retirement Plan
which has been frozen as to new participants). Acquiror shall not be
obligated to cause any Crown Bank employee retained by Acquiror or any
Affiliate of Acquiror to participate in any defined benefit plan (within the
meaning of Section 414(j) of the Code) that is maintained by Acquiror or any
affiliate of Acquiror or to participate in any plan providing comparable
benefits. Crown BankÂ’s employees retained by Acquiror (or an Affiliate of
Acquiror ) shall be employed on an "at will" basis.

(b) At and following the Effective Time, Acquiror shall honor, and Acquiror
shall continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with their
terms, all benefit obligations of Crown Bank under all existing employment
and "change-in-control" and bonus/retention agreements specifically identified
in sections 3.01(d) or 4.03(n)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule. RAC and RGF
shall assume and retain any and all liability under any change in control
agreements, employment agreements and similar agreements not specifically
identified in the Disclosure Schedule.

(c) At such time as employees of Crown Bank become eligible to participate in
a medical, dental or health plan of Acquiror or its Subsidiaries, Acquiror
shall cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations
(other than those not waived under Crown BankÂ’s plan) to the extent such
conditions are covered under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of
Acquiror, (ii) provide full credit under such plans for any deductibles, co-
payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees and their
beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such
participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee
on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee had satisfied any
similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Benefit Plan prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

47 (d) Those employees of Crown Bank (other than temporary and/or co-operative
employees) who do not have an employment, change in control, severance or
bonus/retention agreements and who are not employed by Acquiror or who are
terminated or voluntarily resign after being notified that, as a condition of
employment, such employee must work at a location more than thirty (30) miles
from such employeeÂ’s former location of employment or that such employeeÂ’s
salary will be materially decreased, in any case and in both cases, within
sixty (60) days after the Effective Time, and who sign and deliver a
termination and release agreement in a form attached hereto as Annex F, shall
be entitled to severance according to AcquirorÂ’s current severance policy.
Crown Bank shall take whatever action necessary to terminate any and
all other severance arrangements and to ensure it and Acquiror have no other
liability for any other severance payments (other than as set forth in this
Section 5.09(d), and agreements referenced in Section 5.09(b) above and
specifically identified in sections 3.01(d) or 4.03(n)(i) of the Disclosure
Schedule). Crown Bank shall cooperate with Acquiror to effectuate the
foregoing and to comply with, and provide notices regarding, the Workers
Adjustment and Retraining Act or any similar state or local law, including
without limitation, providing notices to employees and government
representatives. Nothing contained in this Section 5.09 shall be construed or
interpreted to limit or modify in any way AcquirorÂ’s at will employment
policy.

In no event shall severance pay be taken into account in determining the
amount of any other benefit (including but not limited to, an individualÂ’s
benefit under any retirement plan). If, by reason of the controlling plan
document, controlling law or otherwise, severance pay is taken into account in
determining any other benefit, the severance pay otherwise payable shall be
reduced by the present value of the additional benefit determined under other
benefit plans attributable to the severance pay.

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.09 or in this Agreement shall be interpreted as
preventing Acquiror from amending, modifying or terminating any employee
benefit plan or other contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding
in accordance with their terms and applicable law.

(f) If Acquiror so requests, Crown Bank shall take any and all actions
required (including without limitation, the adoption of resolutions by its
Board of Directors) to amend, freeze and/or terminate any or all Crown Bank
Benefits Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time, and, if requested by
Acquiror, to implement any such actions.

(g) If Acquiror so requests, Crown Bank shall take all actions necessary to
file an application for determination letter with the IRS prior to the
Effective Time, for any Benefit Plan requested by Acquiror

(h) With respect to any Benefit Plan that provides for vesting of benefits,
there shall be no discretionary acceleration of vesting without AcquirorÂ’s
consent whether or not such discretionary acceleration of vesting is provided
under the terms of the Benefit Plan.



 

48 (i) Except as may be required by applicable law, Crown Bank, without the
advance written consent of Acquiror not to be unreasonably withheld, shall
not (i) adopt any amendments to the Benefit Plans after the date of this
Agreement; or (ii) make any distributions from the Benefit Plans after the
date of this Agreement other than in the ordinary course of operations of
such Benefit Plans; or (iii) make any discretionary contributions to any of
the Benefit Plans after the date of this Agreement; or (iv) take any action
which would reduce or restrict the availability of surplus (excess of plan
assets over plan liabilities) under any Benefit Plan.

(j) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and except as may be
required by applicable law, in no event shall Crown Bank: (i) take any action
under the terms of any Benefit Plan, employment agreement, change in control
agreement or similar arrangement relating to the payment thereof or funding
of obligations thereunder which would have the effect of increasing any such
payments or funding, nor will Crown Bank adopt or implement any new such plan,
agreement or arrangement, without the prior written consent of Acquiror,
or (ii) make any payments or fund any obligations under any Benefit Plan,
employment agreement, change in control agreement or similar arrangement that
Crown Bank deems are mandatory or required thereunder without prior written
consent of Acquiror, excluding payments made in the ordinary of business
consistent with past practice prior to the date of this Agreement.

(k) Crown Bank shall provide to Acquiror at least fifteen (15) days prior to
the Effective Time, documentation that shows that the requirements of Code
Sections 401(a)(4), 404, 410(b), 412, 415, 416 and 401(k)(3) and (m)(2) are
met by or with respect to each Qualified Benefit Plan of Crown Bank as to the
planÂ’s latest three (3) plan years which have ended prior to the date of this
Agreement (to the extent such Code Sections apply to such plan).

_5.10_ _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of RGF, RAC and Crown Bank, on
the one hand, and Acquiror, on the other hand, shall give prompt notice to
the other(s) of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (i) is
reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events
and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect
with respect to Crown Bank, (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein or (iii) lead to litigation or regulatory action that would delay or
prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

_5.11_ _Estoppel Letters and Consents_. RGF and RAC shall use their
commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Acquiror at the
Closing with respect (i) to all Owned Real Estate, an estoppel letter dated as
of the Closing substantially in the form of Annex A from all tenants, (ii) to
all Real Estate Contracts, an estoppel letter dated as of the Closing
substantially in the form of Annex B, or such other form as may be prescribed
by the applicable Real Estate Contract and reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror
(estoppel letters described in (i) and (ii) shall be known collectively as,
the "Estoppel Letters") and (iii) consent to assignment for all Material
Contracts so identified as requiring consent on the Disclosure Schedules
(the "Consents").



 

49 _5.12_ _Assumption of Indenture Obligations_. In connection with the Closing
of the Transaction, Acquiror, or a direct or indirect Subsidiary or parent of
Acquiror, shall execute such supplemental indentures and provide such
documents, including, without limitation, legal opinions, as are reasonably
required (i) in connection with an acquisition of Crown Bank under the
indentures, trust agreements, guarantee agreements, notices, certificates and
other agreements and assets related to the Trust Preferred Securities, (ii) to
acquire the Common Securities, and (iii) to assume the obligations under the
Trusts and Junior Subordinated Debt and guarantees, each as Previously
Disclosed.

_5.13_ _Antitakeover Statutes_. Each of Acquiror and RGF, RAC and Crown Bank
and their respective Boards of Directors shall, if any state antitakeover
statute or similar statute becomes applicable to this Agreement and
the Transaction, take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that the
Transaction may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on this Agreement and the Transaction.

_5.14_ _Noncompetition._

(a) RGF and RAC each agree that, during the Restricted Period, neither RGF or
RAC shall, directly or indirectly, whether for its own account or for the
account of any other person, firm, corporation, or other business
organization, (i) in the states of Florida or Georgia, engage in providing
Banking Services, except for loans originated in Puerto Rico which are secured
by real property in Florida or purchases of loan participations of financial
institutions, (ii) provide Banking Services to any Client except for Banking
Services already provided to any such Client as of the date hereof by R-G
Premier Bank or R-G Mortgage Corporation, (iii) make any statements or take
any acts that may interfere with Crown BankÂ’s, AcquirorÂ’s or any AffiliateÂ’s
or SubsidiaryÂ’s business relationship with any Client to enter into any
business relationship with any person or firm other than Acquiror, Crown Bank
or an Affiliate or Subsidiary relating to Banking Services of any type, or
(iv) take any actions that may interfere with AcquirorÂ’s, Crown BankÂ’s or
an AffiliateÂ’s or SubsidiaryÂ’s property rights in lists of Clients or
otherwise diminish the value of such lists to Acquiror, Crown Bank or an
affiliate.

(b) The term "Restricted Period" shall mean the period beginning on the
Effective Time and ending three years thereafter. 

(c) The term "Banking Services" shall mean retail or commercial deposit or
lending business, including mortgage lending, trust services, securities
brokerage, asset management and all other services which are customarily
provided by banks or which are otherwise provided by Acquiror, Crown Bank or
their affiliates.



 

50 (d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Client" shall mean all
persons or entities who are or were clients of Crown Bank at the Effective
Time or of Acquiror, Crown Bank or an affiliate during the Restricted Time.

_5.15_ _Nonsolicitation_. Except for such persons as Previously Disclosed, RGF
and RAC each hereby agree that they will not solicit for employment by such
entity or any of its related entities (including but not limited to wholly or
partially-owned subsidiaries or affiliates and affiliates in which any of its
representatives have a controlling interest) any employee or officer of

52 _5.26_ _Adjusted Tangible Book Value_.

(i) The Adjusted Tangible Book Value of Crown Bank reflected on the Closing
Date Balance Sheet shall equal or exceed $226,600,000. The Pro Forma
Tangible Book Value Sheet attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ sets forth the basis
upon which such calculations were made, as well as the additions and
subtractions thereto.

(ii) "Adjusted Tangible Book Value" is defined as Crown Bank stockholderÂ’s
equity, less goodwill and core deposit intangibles, plus the allowance for
loan losses, less the cumulative impact to Adjusted Tangible Book Value of
the restatement and subsequent yearÂ’s adjustments resulting from the
restatement, less deferred tax assets, before giving effect to the assumption
of the Trust Preferred Securities. The following effects of
transactions executed by Crown Bank, subsequent to March 31, 2007 and prior
to Closing, shall be excluded from the calculation of Adjusted Tangible Book
Value: gains or losses related to asset sales (other than as permitted under
this Agreement), branch sales, and sale or termination of liabilities or
revaluation of assets or liabilities, any of which are conducted pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, other than as set forth on _Exhibit A_. Purchase
accounting adjustments made by Acquiror at Closing shall be excluded from the
above calculations.

(iii) After the date hereof until the Closing Date, Crown Bank shall
have provided Acquiror with unaudited balance sheets and income statements
within twenty (20) days after the end of each month prepared in accordance
with past practices of Crown Bank and in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied. The unaudited balance sheet of Crown Bank for the month ending at
least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date but not more than sixty (60)
days prior to the Closing Date shall be delivered with supporting
documentation within ten (10) days of the end of such month which shall
include Crown BankÂ’s calculation of Adjusted Tangible Book Value (the "Closing
Date Balance Sheet"). The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared in
accordance with past practices of Crown Bank and in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied (other than with respect to adjustments related to the
restatement as well as other adjustments set forth in the Pro Forma Tangible
Book Value Sheet attached as _Exhibit A_ and which adjustments may change due
to their calculation as of the month end of the Closing Date Balance Sheet)
and other legal and accounting requirements. Crown Bank shall cooperate and
assist the Acquiror as reasonably requested by the Acquiror in their review of
the Closing Date Balance Sheet, including providing all work papers and other
documents required to complete such review and reasonable access to the
personnel responsible for preparing the Closing Date Balance Sheet. In the
event that the Acquiror disagrees with the content of the Closing Date
Balance Sheet by providing Crown Bank with written notice thereof detailing
the reasons for such disagreement within ten (10) days of delivery, the
Acquiror and Crown Bank shall mutually agree to an independent accounting
firm to review the Closing Date Balance Sheet and, if they cannot agree within
two (2) Business Days of Crown BankÂ’s receipt of such written notice, then
Acquiror and Crown Bank shall each select an independent accounting firm, who
will mutually agree upon a third independent accounting firm within (2)
Business Days to review the Closing Date Balance Sheet; provided, however, the
Closing shall be delayed by a reasonable amount of time to allow the selected
independent accounting firm to accept the engagement and review the Closing
Date Balance Sheet. If the Acquiror does not timely disagree to the Closing
Date Balance Sheet in the manner provided herein, then the Acquiror shall be
deemed to have agreed upon and accepted the contents of the Closing Date
Balance Sheet. The Adjusted  



 

53  Tangible Book Value reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet that is
agreed upon and accepted by the Acquiror or subsequently agreed upon in
writing by Crown Bank and the Acquiror or that is determined by the
independent accounting firm shall be conclusively determinative for purposes
of calculating any payments to be made pursuant to Section 5.26(f)(iv) below
and for purposes of termination as set forth in Section 5.26(f)(v) below. The
fees and cost of any independent accounting firm required hereunder shall be
borne equally by the Acquiror on the one hand and RAC and RGF on the other
hand.

(iv) In the event that the Adjusted Tangible Book Value reflected on the
Closing Date Balance Sheet is less than $221,600,000, the Cash
Consideration payable to RAC shall be reduced on the basis of $1.00 for each
dollar shortfall, subject to a maximum reduction below $226,600,000 in
Adjusted Tangible Book Value of Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000). In the
event that the Adjusted Tangible Book Value reflected on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet is more than $231,600,000, the Acquiror shall pay to RAC the
full amount of any such excess as additional Cash Consideration on the basis
of $1.00 for each dollar. Any payments required to be made pursuant to this
Section 5.26(f) shall be made at the Closing.

(v) In the event that the Adjusted Tangible Book Value reflected on the
Closing Date Balance Sheet is less than $206,600,000, then Acquiror shall have
the right to terminate this Agreement.

(vi) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the _Exhibit A_ attached
hereto and as of the date hereof is for illustrative purposes only and that a
revised _Exhibit A_ shall be prepared in connection with the preparation and
delivery of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and such revised _Exhibit A_ shall
be used for the calculation of Adjusted Tangible Book Value.

_5.27_ _Mutual Cooperation_. Each of RGF, RAC, Crown Bank and Acquiror
mutually covenant and agree that, following the date of this Agreement, it
shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to take the actions needed
to preserve for eighteen (18) months after the Effective Time the financial
books and records of Crown Bank as such exist as of the Effective Time so that
RGF will be able to access and use such financial books and records to
complete the consolidated financial statements that RGF is required to file
with the SEC for the calendar years 2005 and 2006 and the interim quarterly
periods in 2007 which end prior to the Closing. In no way will Acquiror be
required to provide any other assistance with such financial statements
beyond those actions expressly set forth above.

60 _8.07_ _Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
and the Confidentiality Agreement represent the entire understanding of the
parties hereto and thereto with reference to the Transaction, and this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement supersede any and all other oral
or written agreements heretofore made. Except for the Indemnified PartiesÂ’
right to enforce AcquirorÂ’s obligation under Section 5.08, which are expressly
intended to be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives, nothing in
this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person,
other than the parties hereto or their respective successors, any rights,
remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

_8.08_ _Severability_. Except to the extent that application of this Section
8.08 would have a Material Adverse Effect on Crown Bank or Acquiror, any term
or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable. In all such cases, the parties shall use
their commercially reasonable best efforts to substitute a valid, legal and
enforceable provision which, insofar as practicable, implements the original
purposes and intents of this Agreement.

_8.09_ _Enforcement of the Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of
the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

_8.10_ _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of, or
Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table
of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and are not part of this Agreement. Whenever the
words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Whenever
the words "as of the date hereof" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to mean the day and year first above written (May 20, 2007). Whenever
"to the knowledge of" or words of similar import are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to mean the actual knowledge, after reasonable inquiry,
of the present executive officers of Acquiror as to Acquiror, or any of the
present executive officers and officers performing the accounting, internal
audit or regulatory functions of RGF, RAC and Crown Bank as to RGF, RAC or
Crown Bank.

_8.11_ _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other parties, except Acquiror is entitled to assign this Agreement to
a parent, or direct or indirect Subsidiary, that is duly incorporated and in
good standing in its jurisdiction of incorporation and is capable of
