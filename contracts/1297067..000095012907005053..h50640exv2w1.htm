 Section 2.01. _Purchase and Sale_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Seller agrees to sell to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase from Seller, the Interests at the Closing. The purchase price (the "Purchase Price") for the Interests is equal to (i) the Base Purchase Price, _plus_ (ii) the Effective Time Net Working Capital, _minus_ (iii) the aggregate amount of any Agreed-Upon Title Defect Amounts. If the Closing occurs on any date subsequent to the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.02 below), the Estimated Purchase Price shall accrue interest daily from the Effective Time through and including the Closing Date at a rate equal to the lesser of (A) LIBOR _plus_ 2.5% _per annum_ until October 1, 2007 and, if the Closing has not occurred by October 1, 2007, LIBOR _plus_ 5% _per annum_ thereafter and (B) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law (the "Interim Interest"). The Purchase Price shall be paid as provided in Section 2.02 and shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.03 and Section 2.05. 

  

 Section 2.02. _Closing_. The closing (the "Closing") of the purchase and sale of the Interests hereunder shall take place at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than five Business Days, after satisfaction (or to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver) of the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing and will in fact be satisfied at Closing), or at such other time or place as Buyer and Seller may agree; _provided_ that, (i) for accounting purposes, the Closing will be effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the first day of the month in which the Closing occurs (the "Effective Time") and (ii) subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, all of the revenues, income, capital expenditures, costs and expenses of, and Indebtedness incurred by, the Company and its Subsidiaries for the period from the Effective Time through the Closing Date shall be for the 

   ##### 

  

    

benefit or detriment of the Company or such Subsidiary and not Seller. At the
Closing: 

  

 (a) Parent and Buyer shall deliver to Seller as follows: 

   

 (i) Buyer shall deliver the Estimated Cash Purchase Price ( _plus_ the Interim Interest, if any) in cash in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account of Seller with a bank designated by Seller, by notice to Buyer, which notice shall be delivered not later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date (or if not so designated, then by certified or official bank check payable in immediately available funds to the order of Seller in such amount); 

   

 (ii) Parent shall deliver certificates representing 3,245,817 Class D Units (i.e., that number of Class D Units (rounded to the nearest unit) determined by dividing (A) $112.5 million by (B) $34.66; _provided_ that, if at any time prior to Closing, Parent agrees to reduce the per unit purchase price of the Common Units (taking into account any warrants or other equity-linked securities also issued to the purchasers of such Common Units other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the Class E Units issued in the Parents contemplated PIPE equity financing) issued in Parents contemplated PIPE equity financing, then Parent shall deliver certificates representing that number of Class D Units (rounded to the nearest unit) determined by dividing (A) $112.5 million by (B) the lowered purchase price per Common Unit issued in Parents contemplated equity financing; 

   

 (iii) Buyer shall deliver in immediately available funds by wire transfer to the account or accounts designated by Seller, by notice to Buyer, which notice shall be delivered not less than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an amount equal to the amount of Indebtedness (other than Permitted Indebtedness) requested by Seller to be repaid at Closing on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and 

   

 (iv) Parent shall deliver the Registration Rights Agreement, duly executed by Parent. 

  

 (b) Seller shall deliver to Buyer: 

   

 (i) an agreement of assignment in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer assigning to Buyer or its designee all of Sellers right, title and interest to the Interests free and clear of any Lien; and 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) the Registration Rights Agreement, duly executed by Seller. 

  

 Section 2.03 _. Title Defects._ (a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in no event later than 30 days from the date hereof, Buyer shall deliver to Seller written notices identifying each matter that it believes in good faith to be a Title Defect, together with a good faith estimate of the associated Title Defect Amount for each such alleged Title Defect, and reasonable written documentation, to support Buyers claims of each such Title Defect (the "Title Defect Notice"). In order for Seller to review the alleged Title Defects listed in the Title Defect Notice, Buyer will provide to Seller and its representatives copies of any documents used to determine the existence of a Title Defect and the estimated cost to cure any Title Defect. Buyer shall include in the Title Defect Notice only Title Defects that are reasonably believed, in good faith, to individually cost in excess of $25,000 to cure. For purposes of calculating the cost of a Title Defect, the parties shall value (i) rights-of-way at $25 per rod and (ii) surface leases and fee properties at fair market value. 

  

 (b) If Seller disagrees with the existence of a Title Defect or the associated Title Defect Amount, then Seller shall notify Buyer of such disagreement in writing (a "Notice of Disagreement") within 30 days after its receipt of the applicable Title Defect Notice. Such Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail Sellers grounds for such disagreement, the Title Defect Amount estimated by Seller therefor, or both, as the case may be. To the extent Seller does not contest a Title Defect or a Title Defect Amount in a Notice of Disagreement within the time period specified above in this Section 2.03(b), Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the existence of such Title Defect or Title Defect Amount, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. 

  

 (c) If a Notice of Disagreement is timely provided by Seller, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of 30 days after delivery of such Notice of Disagreement (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect to the existence of any Title Defect or Title Defect Amount contested in the Notice of Disagreement. If, at the end of such period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements, then, upon the written request of either party, Seller and Buyer agree that within a further 15 day period, they will jointly select an arbitrator who is an attorney experienced in the natural gas and gas gathering industry in the United States as well as in real estate and title insurance matters, or as otherwise mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer (the "Title Defect Arbitrator"), who shall be entitled to engage experts in the natural gas and gas gathering industry in the United States to assist in making his or her determination, to resolve any remaining disagreements. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree upon the designation of a 

   ##### 

  

    

Person as a Title Defect Arbitrator, they shall request the American
Arbitration Association to appoint the Title Defect Arbitrator and such Title
Defect Arbitrator shall hear all matters submitted under this Section
2.03(c). 

  

 (d) The Title Defect Arbitrator shall determine as promptly as practicable (but in any event within 30 days) following the date on which such dispute is referred to the Title Defect Arbitrator the existence of any alleged Title Defect or the disputed Title Defect Amount, as the case may require, identified in the Notice of Disagreement and not previously resolved by the parties. Each party shall set forth in writing its position regarding the existence of each alleged Title Defect and each Title Defect Amount referred to the Title Defect Arbitrator for resolution, and the Title Defect Arbitrator shall be required to select the position of either one party or the other with respect to each such Title Defect or Title Defect Amount, as the case may require. Each party shall bear its own expenses and the fees and expenses of its own representatives and experts in connection with the preparation, review, dispute (if any) and final determination of any alleged Title Defects. Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall share equally the costs, expenses and fees of the Title Defect Arbitrator and any experts retained by the Title Defect Arbitrator. The determination of the Title Defect Arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties and shall be enforceable in any court having jurisdiction. 

  

 (e) As used in this Agreement, an "Agreed-Upon Title Defect" shall mean any of (i) a Title Defect that is not contested under any Notice of Disagreement timely given, (ii) a Title Defect that is mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller or (iii) a Title Defect resulting from a determination of the Title Defect Arbitrator pursuant to Section 2.03(d) above. The date on which any Title Defect becomes an Agreed-Upon Title Defect pursuant to the foregoing is referred to as the "Title Defect Determination Date." An "Agreed-Upon Title Defect Amount" shall mean any of (i) a Title Defect Amount that is not contested under any Notice of Disagreement timely given, (ii) a Title Defect Amount that is mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller or (iii) a Title Defect Amount resulting from a determination of the Title Defect Arbitrator pursuant to Section 2.03(d) above;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the Agreed-Upon Title Defect Amount in respect of any Title Defect relating to Company Real Property owned or leased by Bighorn shall be equal to 51.0% of the applicable Title Defect Amount and (y) the Agreed-Upon Title Defect Amount in respect of any Title Defect relating to Company Real Property owned or leased by Fort Union shall be equal 37.04% of the applicable Title Defect Amount. 

  

 (f) At Closing the Estimated Cash Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of any Agreed-Upon Title Defect Amount finalized by Closing. After Closing, the Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer any Agreed-Upon Title Defect Amount finalized after Closing. Buyer understands and agrees that the Purchase 

   ##### 

  

    

Price adjustment provided in this Section 2.03 is the sole and exclusive
remedy for a Title Defect, and no claim may be made by Buyer with respect to
any representation or warranty made by Seller or any of its Affiliates or
representatives with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 2.03, the Purchase Price shall not be decreased by any Agreed-Upon
Title Defect Amount unless and until the aggregate Agreed-Upon Title Defect
Amount exceeds $1,000,000, then only to the extent of such excess, and the
maximum decrease of the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall
not exceed $2,000,000. 

  

 (g) For purposes of this Section 2.03, "Title Defect" shall not include any Title Defect of which the Buyer becomes aware through any surveys or letters or notices to third parties. 

  

 Section 2.04 _. Closing Estimates_. At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement") containing Sellers good faith estimate of Effective Time Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Net Working Capital Amount"), together with (i) a reasonably detailed computation of such estimate, and (ii) such supporting documentation and other data as is reasonably requested by Buyer to substantiate Sellers determination of such amount. Attached hereto as Schedule A is an illustrative calculation of Effective Time Net Working Capital as of the Balance Sheet Date as if the Balance Sheet Date were the Effective Time. The Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the illustrative calculation included on Schedule A using the same methodologies, practices, policies and judgments as were used in the preparation of the Financial Statements, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, including Schedule A. 

  

 Section 2.05 _. Post-Closing Purchase Price Reconciliation._ (a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any event within 90 days thereafter, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a closing statement of the Company (the "Closing Statement"), prepared by Seller in good faith and in accordance with the illustrative calculation included on Schedule A using the same methodologies, practices, policies and judgments as were used in the preparation of the Financial Statements, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, setting forth in reasonable detail the proposed final calculation of Effective Time Net Working Capital and the Effective Time Adjustment Amount. 

  

 (b) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide to Seller and its representatives access, during normal business hours and on reasonable advance notice, to the personnel, accountants, books and records of the Company and the Subsidiaries to the extent necessary with respect to the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Effective Time Net Working Capital and the Effective 

   ##### 

  

    

Time Adjustment Amount. From and after the delivery of the Closing Statement
to Buyer, Seller shall provide to Buyer and its representatives access,
during normal business hours and on reasonable advance notice, to the
personnel, accountants, books and records used by Seller or
its representatives in the preparation of the Closing Statement and the
calculation of the Effective Time Net Working Capital and the Effective Time
Adjustment Amount. 

  

 (c) Within 20 days after Buyers receipt of the Closing Statement, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing whether Buyer agrees or disagrees with the Closing Statement. If Seller does not receive such notice within such 20-day period, it shall be deemed that Buyer has accepted the Closing Statement with respect to all items set forth therein as of the expiration of such 20-day period. If Buyer accepts (or is deemed to accept, as provided in the immediately preceding sentence) the Closing Statement, Buyer or Seller, as appropriate, shall, within five Business Days of such acceptance (or deemed acceptance), make the following adjustments: (i) if the Effective Time Adjustment Amount is a positive number, Buyer shall pay to Seller in cash (by means of federal funds wire or interbank transfer in immediately available funds) the Effective Time Adjustment Amount, or (ii) if the Effective Time Adjustment Amount is a negative number, Seller shall pay to Buyer in cash (by means of federal funds wire or interbank transfer in immediately available funds) the absolute value of the Effective Time Adjustment Amount. In the event that any payment required by this Section 2.05(c) is not made by the appropriate party when due pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.05(c), such payment shall accrue interest from the date such payment was due at the lesser of (A) LIBOR _plus_ 2.5% _per annum_ until October 1, 2007 and, if the Closing has not occurred by October 1, 2007, LIBOR _plus_ 5% _per annum_ thereafter and (B) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. 

  

 (d) If Buyer disagrees with Sellers calculation of the Effective Time Adjustment Amount set forth in the Closing Statement, Buyers notice as delivered pursuant to Section 2.05(c) (a "Buyer Notice of Disagreement") shall specify Buyers calculation of the Effective Time Adjustment Amount and shall specify in reasonable detail the items or amounts as to which Buyer disagrees and the nature and extent of such disagreement. Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement and the Effective Time Adjustment Amount. Buyer and Seller shall have a period of 30 days from Sellers receipt of a Buyer Notice of Disagreement to resolve any disagreement specified therein. Any disputed amounts which cannot be agreed to by the parties within 30 days after Sellers receipt of a Buyer Notice of Disagreement to the Closing Statement shall be determined by a mutually agreeable nationally recognized accounting firm that does not have a material relationship with either Seller or Buyer, or any of their respective Affiliates (the "Accounting Firm"). The engagement of and the determination by the Accounting Firm (or any other accounting firm designated by the Accounting 

    ##### 

 

  

Firm as set forth below) shall be completed within 60 days after such
assignment is given to the Accounting Firm and shall be final and binding on
Seller and Buyer. If for any reason the Accounting Firm is unable to act in
such capacity, such determination will be made by any other nationally
recognized accounting firm selected by the Accounting Firm. Buyer agrees that
it will cause the Company and each Subsidiary (other than Fort Union) to and
that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Fort Union to, and
Buyer and Seller agree that they will use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause their respective independent accountants to, cooperate
and assist in the preparation of the conduct of the audits and reviews
referred to in this Section 2.05(d), including the making available to the
extent necessary of books, records, work papers and personnel. The fees and
expenses payable to the Accounting Firm (or any other accounting
firm designated by the Accounting Firm) in connection with such determination
will be borne by Buyer if the difference between the Effective Time
Adjustment Amount as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.05(d) (the
"Final Effective Time Adjustment Amount") and Buyers calculation of
the Effective Time Adjustment Amount specified in the Buyer Notice of
Disagreement is greater than the difference between the Final Effective Time
Adjustment Amount and Sellers calculation of the Effective Time Adjustment
Amount specified in the Closing Statement, by Seller if the first
such difference is less than the second such difference and otherwise equally
by Buyer and Seller. 

   

 (e) Within five Business Days of the date on which the last disputed item required to determine the Final Effective Time Adjustment Amount is resolved by the Accounting Firm, Buyer or Seller, as appropriate, shall make the payments described in Section 2.05(c) hereof. 

  

 (f) For the avoidance of doubt, the purchase price adjustments to be made pursuant to Section 2.03 and this Section 2.05 are not intended to be used to adjust for items or amounts reflected in or set forth on the Financial Statements, including the notes thereto. 

  

 Section 2.06 _. Allocation of Purchase Price._ Not later than 90 days after the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement (the "Allocation Statement"), allocating the Purchase Price (plus the liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent properly taken into account under Section 1060 of the Code) among the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. If within 20 days after the delivery of the Allocation Statement Seller notifies Buyer in writing that Seller objects to the allocation set forth in the Allocation Statement, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute within 20 days. In the event that Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve such dispute within 20 days, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain a mutually satisfactory nationally recognized accounting firm (which firm shall not have any material relationship with Buyer 

   #####

ARTICLE 3 
 Representations and Warranties of Seller 

   

 Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as of the date hereof that: 

  

 Section 3.01. _Existence and Power_. Each of Seller and the Company is a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence of which would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign Person and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. Seller has made available through the electronic data room or otherwise provided to Buyer true and correct copies of the certificate of formation and limited liability company operating agreement of the Company, as in effect on the date hereof. 

  

 Section 3.02. _Seller Authorization_. Seller has all limited liability company power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary limited liability company action on the part of Seller. This 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Seller and constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of Seller, enforceable against Seller in
accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting
creditors rights generally and except insofar as the availability of
equitable remedies may be limited by applicable law. 

  

 Section 3.03. _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority other than (i) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and (ii) any such action or filing as to which the failure to make or obtain would not have a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 Section 3.04. _Noncontravention_.

It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties set forth in this Section 3.04 do not address facts and circumstances that would not have arisen but for facts and circumstances specific to Buyer and its Affiliates (as opposed to any other Person). 

  

 Section 3.05. _Capitalization_. (a) The Interests constitute all of the outstanding membership interests of the Company. As of the date hereof, there are 1,960 options outstanding to purchase membership interests of the Company (the "Options") granted under the Companys 2004 Option Plan (the "Option Plan"). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) All outstanding Interests of the Company have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable, and were not issued in violation of, or subject to, any preemptive rights or other preferential rights of subscription or purchase of any Person. Except as set forth in this Section 3.05 and for the Options, there are no outstanding (i) Interests or other equity securities of the Company, (ii) rights or securities of the Company convertible into or exchangeable for Interests or other equity securities of the Company or (iii) options or other rights to acquire from the Company, or other obligation, understanding or arrangement by which the Company is bound to issue or transfer any Interests or other equity securities of the Company or rights or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Interests or other equity securities of the Company (the items in clauses 3.05(b)(i), 3.05(b)(ii) and 3.05(b)(iii) being referred to collectively as the "Company Securities"). 

  

 (c) Except pursuant to the Option Plan, none of the Company Securities contain any provision requiring the Company or any other Person to redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire, and there are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, any Company Securities. Except as provided in the Companys organizational documents, there are no voting trusts or similar agreements with respect to the Company Securities and there are no agreements or arrangements under which the Company is obligated to register the sale of any of its securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

 Section 3.06. _Ownership of Interests; Acquisition for Investment_. (a) Except as set forth in Section 3.06 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, Seller is the record and beneficial owner of the Interests, free and clear of any Lien. Seller will transfer and deliver to Buyer at the Closing valid title to the Interests free and clear of any Lien. 

  

 (b) Seller is an accredited investor within the meaning of Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act, and the Class D Units being acquired by Seller pursuant to this Agreement are being acquired for its own account and not with a view toward, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof except in compliance with applicable United States federal and state securities laws. Seller is aware that no Governmental Authority has made any finding or determination as to the fairness of an investment in the Class D Units, nor any recommendation or endorsement with respect thereto. Seller acknowledges and understands that (i) the acquisition of the Class D Units has not been registered under the Securities Act in reliance on an exemption therefrom; (ii) the Class D Units acquired by Seller will, upon acquisition, be characterized as "restricted securities" under state and federal securities laws; and (iii) such Class D Units 

   ##### 

  

    

may be sold without registration under such state and federal securities laws
only in certain limited circumstances. Seller has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Class D Units and is
capable of bearing the economic risks of such investment. Neither Seller nor
anyone acting on its behalf has offered or sold or will offer or sell any of
the Class D Units by means of any form of general solicitation or
general advertising or has taken or will take any action that would
constitute a distribution of the Class D Units under the Securities Act,
would render the disposition of the Class D Units a violation of Section 5 of
the Securities Act or any state or other applicable securities law, or would
require registration (unless registered) or qualification pursuant thereto. 

  

 Section 3.07. _Subsidiaries_. (a) Each Subsidiary of the Company is a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals the absence of which would not have a Material Adverse Effect. All Subsidiaries of the Company (including the amount or percentage of the Companys direct or indirect ownership of such Subsidiaries) and their respective jurisdictions of organization are identified on Section 3.07 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Except as set forth in Section 3.07 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and its Subsidiaries do not, directly or indirectly, own any equity interest in any other Person.

   ##### 

  

    

securities of any Subsidiary of the Company (the items in clauses (i), (ii)

No events have occurred with respect to any Employee Plan that could result in payment or assessment by or against the Company of any material excise taxes under Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979, 4980, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the Code. 

  

 (e) Except as set forth in Section 3.19 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any current or projected liability in respect of post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life insurance benefits for retired, former or current employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except as required to avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code. Each Employee Plan may be unilaterally amended or terminated in its entirety without liability except as to benefits accrued thereunder prior to such amendment or termination and except for any outstanding premiums due in respect thereof. 

  

 (f) To the knowledge of Seller, except as set forth in Section 3.19 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no matter pending (other than routine qualification determination filings) with respect to any of the Employee Plans

any other Governmental Authority. 

  

 (g) Each trust funding an Employee Plan, which trust is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation pursuant to Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, satisfies the requirements of such section and has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service regarding such exempt status and has not, since receipt of the most recent favorable determination letter, been amended or operated in a way which would adversely affect such exempt status.

Except as set forth in Section 3.20 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no action, suit, proceeding, investigation, audit or claim now proposed or pending or to Sellers knowledge, threatened, against or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any material Tax.

Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than Bighorn and Fort Union) is an entity properly treated as "disregarded as an entity separate from its owner" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3 for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each of Bighorn and Fort Union (collectively, the "Partnerships") is properly treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and each of the Partnerships has in effect an election to adjust the basis of partnership property under Section 754 of the Code.

representation or warranty pursuant to this Section 4.06 with respect to
any current report on Form 8-K of Parent that was "furnished" rather than

Incorporated, whose fees will be paid by Buyer, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary which has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of Buyer or Parent who might be entitled to any fee or commission 

   ##### 

  

    

from Seller or any of its Affiliates upon consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 4.12. _Inspections; No Other Representations_.

 (a) (i) Buyer shall have performed in all material respects all of its obligations hereunder required to be performed by it at or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement and in any certificate or other writing delivered by Buyer pursuant hereto shall be true in all material respects at and as of the Closing Date, as if made at and as of such date and (iii) Seller shall have received a certificate signed by an officer of Buyer to the foregoing effect. 

   

 (b) Seller shall have received all documents it may reasonably request relating to the existence of Buyer and the authority of Buyer for this Agreement, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller. 

  

ARTICLE 10 
 Termination 

   

 Section 10.01. _Grounds for Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing: 

   

 (a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer; 

   

 (b) by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before December 31, 2007; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur prior to such date; or 

   

 (c) by either Seller or Buyer if consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby would violate any nonappealable final order, decree or judgment of any court or Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction. 

 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clauses 10.01(b) or
10.01(c) shall give notice of such termination to the other party. 

   

 Section 10.02. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by Section 10.01, such termination shall be without liability of either party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other party to this Agreement; _provided_ that 

   ##### 

  

    

nothing in this Section 10.02 shall relieve any party for a breach of its
obligations, representations or warranties under this Agreement. The
provisions of Sections 5.10, 6.01, 10.02, 12.04, 12.06, 12.07 and 12.08 shall
survive any termination hereof pursuant to Article 10. 

  

ARTICLE 11 
 Tax Matters 

   

 Section 11.01. _Federal Income Tax Indemnity_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer against and agrees to hold it harmless from and to pay any liability for (a) any Federal Income Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Bighorn or Fort Union) and the Applicable Percentage of any Federal Income Taxes imposed on Bighorn or Fort Union, in each case, for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Effective Time (based on a closing of the books as of the Effective Time) and (b) costs, expenses (including reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys and accountants fees and expenses) arising out of or incident to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any liabilities described in (a) preceding, including those incurred in the contest in good faith in appropriate proceedings relating to the imposition, assessment or assertion of such liabilities, in each case incurred or suffered by Buyer, any of Buyers Affiliates, Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries after the Effective Time; _provided_ that Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify Buyer under this Article 11 for any Federal Income Taxes included in the calculation of the Closing Statement and the Effective Time Net Working Capital. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the contingency for federal income tax liability related to the reorganization of the Company described in footnote 5 to the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 is not included in the calculation of the Closing Statement and the Effective Time Net Working Capital and is therefore subject to indemnification by Seller pursuant to this Article 11\. For purposes of this Agreement, "Federal Income Tax" means any tax imposed under Subtitle A of the Code, together with any interest, penalty, addition to tax or additional amount imposed under the Code, and including any liability for any of the foregoing items that arises by reason of a contract, assumption, transferee or successor liability, operation of law, Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any predecessor or successor thereof) or otherwise. For purposes of this Agreement, "Applicable Percentage" means 51.0% in the case of Bighorn and 37.04% in the case of Fort Union. 

  

 Section 11.02. _Federal Income Tax Contests_. If any claim or demand for Federal Income Taxes in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to 

   ##### 

  

    

Section 11.01 is asserted in writing against Buyer, any of the Buyers
Affiliates, Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, Buyer shall notify
Seller of such claim or demand within 10 days of receipt thereof, or such
earlier time that would allow Seller to timely respond to such claim or
demand, and shall give Seller such information with respect thereto as Seller
may reasonably request. Seller may discharge, at any time, its
indemnification obligation under Section 11.01 by paying to Buyer the amount
payable pursuant to Section 11.01, calculated on the date of such payment.
Seller may, at its own expense, participate in and, upon notice to Buyer,
assume the defense of any such claim, suit, action, litigation or proceeding
(including any Tax audit). If Seller assumes such defense, Seller shall have
the sole discretion as to the conduct of such defense and Buyer shall have the
right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by Seller.
Whether or not Seller chooses to defend or prosecute any claim, all of the
parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.
Seller shall not be liable under Section 11.01 for (a) any Federal Income
Taxes the payment of which was made without Sellers prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or (b) any settlements (i)
effected without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, or (ii) resulting from any claim, suit, action,
litigation or proceeding with respect to which Seller was not notified
pursuant to this Section 11.02. 

  

 Section 11.03. _Purchase Price Adjustments_. Any amount paid by Seller under this Article 11 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law. 

  

ARTICLE 12 
 Miscellaneous 

   

 Section 12.01. _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements._ (a) No representations, warranties or agreements of Parent, Buyer, Company or Seller contained herein shall survive beyond the Closing, except that (a) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.06(b), Section 3.27, Section 4.05(d) and (e), Section 4.09 and Section 4.12 shall survive indefinitely and (b) the agreements contained in Sections 5.02(b) (Access to Information), 5.06 (Indemnification of Buyer), 5.08 (Financial Statements) 5.11 (Confidentiality), 5.12 (Non-Solicitation), Article 6 (Covenants of Buyer), 7.01 (Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances), 7.03 (Public Announcements), 7.04 (WARN Act), 7.05 (Transfer Taxes), 7.07(b) (Transfer of Class D Units), 7.08 (Partnership Information Returns), Article 8 (Employee Benefits), Article 11 (Tax Matters) and Article 12 (Miscellaneous) hereof shall survive beyond the Closing indefinitely or, if applicable, to the extent provided therein. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, Buyer and Parent waive any rights and claims Buyer or Parent may have against Seller, whether in law or in equity, relating to the Company or the Interests or the transactions contemplated hereby. The rights and claims waived by Buyer include claims for contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental Law (whether now or hereinafter in effect), claims for breach of contract, breach of representation or warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all other claims for breach of duty. After the Closing, Section 5.06, Article 11 and Section 12.01(a) will provide the exclusive remedy for any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or agreement or other claim arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. 

  

 (b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. 

  

 Section 12.04. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense. 

  

 Section 12.05. _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns;  _provided_ that no party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without

the consent of each other party hereto, except that Buyer shall be entitled
to assign its rights (including the right to receive the Interests) and
obligations under this Agreement to one or more direct or indirect
Subsidiaries of Parent without the prior written consent, _provided_ that
Buyer shall not be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder in connection
with any such assignment. 

  

 Section 12.06. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state. 

  

 Section 12.07. _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State court sitting in New York City, so long as one of such courts shall have subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in the State of New York, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 12.01 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party. 

  

 Section 12.08. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 

  

 Section 12.09. _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or 

   ##### 

  

    

written agreement or other communication). No provision of this Agreement is
intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations, or
liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns. 

  

 Section 12.10. _Guaranty_. Parent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Seller the prompt and full discharge by Buyer of all of Buyers covenants, agreements, obligations and liabilities under this Agreement, including the due and punctual payment of all amounts which are or may become due and payable by Buyer hereunder when and as the same shall become due and payable (collectively, the "Buyer Obligations"), in accordance with the terms hereof. Parent acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to all Buyer Obligations to pay money, such guaranty shall be a guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection and shall not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit of any remedies against Buyer. If Buyer shall default in the due and punctual performance of any Buyer Obligation, including the full and timely payment of any amount due and payable pursuant to any Buyer Obligation, Parent will forthwith perform or cause to be performed such Buyer Obligation and will forthwith make full payment of any amount due with respect thereto at its sole cost and expense. 

  

 Section 12.11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 12.12. _Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

  

 Section 12.13. _Disclosure Schedules; Certain Representations and Warranties Made to the Knowledge of Seller_. (a) The Company has or may have set forth information on the Company Disclosure Schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule need not be set forth in any other Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule so long as its relevance to 

   ##### 

  

    

such other Section or section of the Agreement is reasonably apparent on the
face of the information disclosed therein to the Person to which such
disclosure is being made. The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the
Company Disclosure Schedule may include certain items and information solely
for informational purposes for the convenience of Buyer and (ii) the
disclosure by Seller of any matter in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by Seller that the matter is
required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is
material. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent that the representations and warranties of the Seller set forth in Sections 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14 and 3.21 relate to Fort Union, such representations and warranties shall be deemed to have been made to the knowledge of Seller. 

  

 Section 12.14. _Antidilution_. Wherever in this Agreement there is a reference to a specific number of units of Parent of any class or series, or a price per unit or consideration received in respect of such unit, then, upon the occurrence of any subdivision, combination, or unit dividend or unit distribution of such class or series, the specific number of units or the price so referenced in this Agreement shall automatically be proportionately adjusted to reflect the effect on the outstanding units of such class or series by such subdivision, combination, dividend or distribution. 

   ##### 

  

  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first above written.
