in the Title Defect Notice, Buyer will provide to Seller and its representatives copies of any
documents used to determine the existence of a Title Defect and the estimated cost to cure any
Title Defect. Buyer shall include in the Title Defect Notice only Title Defects that are
reasonably believed, in good faith, to individually cost in excess of $25,000 to cure. For

pay any liability for (a)&nbsp;any Federal Income Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than Bighorn or Fort Union) and the Applicable Percentage of any Federal Income
Taxes imposed on Bighorn or Fort Union, in each case, for any taxable period (or portion thereof)

good faith in appropriate proceedings relating to the imposition, assessment or assertion of such
liabilities, in each case incurred or suffered by Buyer, any of Buyer&#146;s Affiliates, Company or any

to indemnify Buyer under this Article&nbsp;11 for any Federal Income Taxes included in the calculation
of the Closing Statement and the Effective Time Net Working Capital. For the avoidance of doubt,
the parties agree that the contingency for federal income tax liability related to the
reorganization of the Company described in footnote 5 to the consolidated financial statements of
the Company for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2006 is not included in the calculation of the
Closing Statement and
the Effective Time Net Working Capital and is therefore subject to indemnification by Seller
pursuant to this Article&nbsp;11. For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;<B>Federal Income Tax</B>&#148; means any tax
imposed under Subtitle&nbsp;A of the Code, together with any interest, penalty, addition to tax or
additional amount imposed under the Code, and including any liability for any of the foregoing
items that arises by reason of a contract, assumption, transferee or successor liability, operation
of law, Treasury Regulations Section&nbsp;1.1502-6 (or any predecessor or successor thereof) or
