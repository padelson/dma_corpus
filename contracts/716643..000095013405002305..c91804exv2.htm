-37-    

       |   | Authority (other than a court) assessing a liability

Authority (other than a court) on behalf of any such employee or former
employee only if: (i) Notice with respect to such claim has been received by
the Sellers Representative prior to October 31, 2005; (ii) the matter or
matters giving rise to such claim relate solely to the period prior to the
Closing Date (and, for greater certainty, such matter or matters do not
relate to any conduct or action occurring on or after the Closing Date) (any
such claim satisfying both (i) and (ii) of this Section 13.1(e), an "Employee
Claim"), and provided however, notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary; (iii) no indemnification shall be payable by such
Seller pursuant to this Section 13.1(e) to the extent that any of the Buyer

employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by any Governmental
Authority (other than a court) on behalf of such employee or former employee
except to the extent such claim results in a breach of any
other representation or warranty under Section 3 or 4 (for greater certainty,
if any such claim results in a breach of any other representation or
warranty, this Section 13.1(e) shall not be applicable).

 Notwithstanding anything provided in this Agreement to the contrary, the indemnification obligations of each Seller pursuant to Section 13.1 shall be limited as follows:

with respect to any claim for breach of any representation or warranty made

expiration or termination date, if any, prescribed for such representation,
warranty or covenant in Section 12.1 hereof;  
---|---|--- 
       ##### 

  

     

-38-    

       | (b)   | no indemnification shall be payable by any Seller
hereunder until the total of recoverable claims for indemnification against
all the Sellers shall exceed $1,000,000 (the "Deductible") (such amount being
a deductible amount versus a threshold), in which event the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall then only be entitled to recover the amount of such recoverable
claims in excess of the Deductible; provided, however that the Deductible
shall not apply to any claims for indemnification as a result of the
disallowance of any deduction claimed by the United States Subsidiaries for
the Transaction Benefits described in subsection (i) or (ii) of such
definition (and for greater certainty, any such amount shall not be included
in any calculation of whether the total of recoverable claims against all the
Sellers exceeds the Deductible);  
---|---|--- 
      
     | (c)   | the aggregate liability of the Sellers for
indemnification payable under this Agreement shall not exceed $20,000,000
(the "Indemnity Cap"); provided that, solely in the case of a Tax Claim, the
Indemnity Cap will be increased up to, but in no event in excess of
$40,000,000 to the extent necessary to satisfy any such liability. For
greater certainty, the parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the amount
represented by any such increase in the Indemnity Cap will be available
solely to satisfy any liability arising pursuant to a Tax Claim and (ii) any
and all payments made pursuant to Section 13.1(e) shall reduce (dollar for
dollar) the aggregate amount otherwise available for indemnification
under this Section 13.2(c);  
      
     | (d)   | notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the maximum
aggregate liability of each Seller shall be such Sellers Pro Rata Liability
Share of the applicable Indemnity Cap; and  
      
     | (e)   | the maximum liability of each Seller for a particular
indemnity claim (other than an indemnity claim regarding a representation or
warranty given by such Seller in Section 4) shall be limited solely to an
amount which is equal to the amount of such indemnity claim, multiplied by
such Sellers Pro Rata Liability Share.  
     

13.3 _Indemnification by Buyer._     

 Subject to the provisions of this Section 13, from and after Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold Sellers and their shareholders, general and limited partners, officers, directors, employees and agents (the "Seller Indemnified Parties"), harmless from and against any Losses sustained or suffered by the Seller Indemnified Parties to the extent caused by or arising from: (a) a breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer herein; (b) a failure to perform any covenant made by Buyer herein; or (c) any act or occurrence, which takes place after the Closing pertaining in any way to the operation of the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries by Buyer or any of its affiliates after the Closing (including, without limitation, any warranty or product liability claims, and any liability under employment, labor, discrimination, Tax, Environmental or other laws).     ##### 

  

     

-39-    

13.4 _Limitations on Amount of Indemnification by Buyer._     

 Notwithstanding anything provided in this Agreement to the contrary, the indemnification obligations of Buyer pursuant to Section 13.3 shall be limited as follows:   

       | (a)   | no indemnification shall be payable by Buyer with
respect to any claim for breach of any representation or warranty made by
Buyer or failure to perform any covenant asserted by a Seller Indemnified
Party after the expiration or termination date, if any, prescribed for such
representation, warranty or covenant in Section 12.1 hereof.  
---|---|--- 
      
     | (b)   | The aggregate liability of the Buyer for indemnification
payable under this Agreement shall not exceed the Indemnity Cap.  
     

13.5 _Notice and Defense of Claims._     

       | (a)   | In the event that any Person shall incur or suffer
any Losses in respect of which indemnification may be sought by such Person
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 13 (including any application of
the Deductible), the Person seeking to be indemnified hereunder (the
"Indemnified Party") shall assert a claim for indemnification by written
notice (a "Notice") to the Person from whom indemnification is sought (the
"Indemnifying Party") stating the nature and basis of such claim and
including copies of all relevant pleadings and other demands. In the case of
Losses arising by reason of any third party claim, the Notice shall be given
within fifteen (15) days of the filing or other written assertion of any such
claim against the Indemnified Party, but the failure of the Indemnified Party
to give the Notice within such time period shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of any liability that the Indemnifying Party may have to the
Indemnified Party unless and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced thereby.  
---|---|--- 
      
     | (b)   | The Indemnified Party shall provide to the Indemnifying
Party on request all information and documentation reasonably necessary to
support and verify any Losses which the Indemnified Party believes give rise
to a claim for indemnification hereunder and shall give the Indemnifying
Party reasonable access to all premises, books, records and personnel in the
possession or under the control of the Indemnified Party which would have
bearing on such claim.  
      
     | (c)   | In the case of any third party claims for which
indemnification is sought, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to:
(i) conduct and control any proceedings or negotiations; (ii) perform and
control or direct the performance of activities required, including remedial
activities under Environmental Laws, (iii) take all other steps to settle or
defend any such claim (provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle
any such claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the
settlement includes a complete release of the Indemnified Party with respect
to the claim); and (iv) employ counsel to contest any such claim or
liability. In the event the Indemnifying Party elects  
      ##### 

  

   

       

-40-    

       |   | to conduct and control any proceedings itself, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to fully participate at its own expense
and by its own counsel in any proceedings relating to any third-party claim.
The Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the
Notice to Indemnifying Party, notify the Indemnified Party of its intention
as to the conduct and control of the defense of such claim, provided that the
Indemnified Party and its counsel cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and
its counsel. Until the Indemnified Party has received notice of the
Indemnifying Partys election whether to defend any claim, the Indemnified
Party shall take reasonable steps to defend (but may not settle) such claim.
If the Indemnifying Party shall decline to assume the defense of any such
claim, or the Indemnifying Party shall fail to notify the Indemnified Party
within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Notice of the Indemnifying
Partys election to defend such claim, the Indemnified Party shall defend
against such claim provided that the Indemnified Party shall not settle such
claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The expenses of all
proceedings, contests or lawsuits in respect of such claims shall be borne by
the Indemnifying Party but only if the Indemnifying Party is responsible
pursuant hereto to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of the third
party claim and, if applicable, only to the extent required by Section 13.2,
and Section 13.4, as the case may be, and subject to the limitations of
Section 13.5 and Section 13.6 . In the event that defendants in any third
party claim subject to this Section 13.5(c) include the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have received advice
from counsel that the Indemnified Party has available to it one or
more material defenses or counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or
more of those that may be available to the Indemnifying Party in respect of
such claim or any litigation relating thereto, in each case, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in such claim, and, in
such event, the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket disbursements of such
counsel shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party. Regardless of whether the
Indemnified Parties or the Indemnifying Parties shall assume the defense of
the claim, the Indemnified Parties and the Indemnifying Parties agree
to cooperate fully with one another in connection therewith and to keep each
other reasonably informed of the status of the claim and any related
proceeding and the Indemnified Party shall take no action or make any
admissions or statements not required by applicable law which would adversely
effect the defense of any such claim.

     | (d)   | (i) If a claim shall be made by any taxing authority,
which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment to any Buyer
Indemnified Party including for greater certainty, any claim under Section
13.1(d), the Buyer shall promptly (and in any event no later than 15 days
following notice of any Buyer Indemnified Party of such claim) notify the
Sellers Representative and the Management Representative in writing (a
"Sellers Representative Tax Notice") of such claim (a "Tax Claim") and shall
include with such Sellers Representative Tax Notice any and all notices
of audit, assessment or other written communication received from the taxing
authority. If a Sellers  
       ##### 

  

     

-41-    

       |   | Representative Tax Notice is not given to the Sellers
Representative within such 15 day period, the Sellers shall not be liable to
any Buyer Indemnified Party to the extent that the Sellers position is
prejudiced as a result thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer
will promptly deliver to the Sellers Representative any notice of audit or
notice of inquiry by any taxing authority which may result in an indemnity
payment under this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
      
     |   | (ii) With respect to any Tax Claim, the Sellers
Representative shall have the right to control and conduct all audits,
proceedings and negotiations, at its sole expense, in connection with such
Tax Claim (including, without limitation, selection of counsel) and, without
limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or forego any and
all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any
taxing authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion,
either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable law permits
such refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner. The
Sellers Representative shall, within 30 days of receipt of a Sellers
Representative Tax Notice with respect to a Tax Claim (the "Tax Notice
Period"), notify the Buyer in writing of its intention to control and conduct
the proceedings and negotiations, in connection with such Tax Claim, provided
that, solely in the event that the Buyer Indemnified Party is required by
applicable law to pay any amount relating to such Tax Claim (a "Required Tax
Payment"), Sellers Representative shall not have such right to control the
proceedings relating to such Tax Claim unless Sellers Representative causes
such Required Tax Payment to be paid or posts a bond or other security in the
amount of such Required Tax Payment. In the event that the Sellers
Representative does notify the Buyer of its intention to control and conduct
the proceedings and negotiations in connection with any Tax Claim as provided
above, the Buyer shall have the right to fully participate in such
proceedings and negotiations (including, without limitation, with counsel of
its choice), at its sole expense, and the Sellers Representative shall fully
cooperate with the Buyer in connection with such participation. If
the Sellers Representative does not deliver to the Buyer within the Tax
Notice Period written notice that it will control and conduct the proceedings
and negotiations in connection with a Tax Claim, the Buyer may control, or
cause the Company or the Subsidiaries to control, and conduct
such proceedings and negotiations in such manner as it may deem appropriate
subject in all cases to Section 13.5(d)(iii) below. In the event that the
Sellers Representative does not exercise its right to control and conduct
the proceedings and negotiations in connection with any Tax Claim as provided
above, the Sellers Representative shall have the right to fully participate
in such proceedings and negotiations (including, without limitation, with
counsel of its choice), at its sole expense, and the Buyer shall, and shall
cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to, fully cooperate with the Sellers
Representative and its accountants and other representatives in connection
with such participation, and in all cases the Buyer shall keep the
Sellers Representative fully informed as to all matters concerning such Tax
Claim and shall promptly notify the Seller in writing of any and all
significant developments relating thereto. Without limiting Sections 12.2 and
12.3 and  
       ##### 

  

     

-42-    

       |   | 9.3, the Buyer shall (and the Buyer shall cause the
Company and the Subsidiaries to) fully cooperate with the Sellers
Representative in contesting any Tax Claim, which cooperation shall include,
without limitation, the retention and (upon the Sellers Representatives
request) the provision to the Sellers Representative of records and
information which are relevant to such Tax Claim, and making officers and
employees available on a timely and mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or
to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.  
---|---|--- 
      
     |   | (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, in no event shall the Buyer settle or otherwise compromise (or permit
the Company or the Subsidiaries to settle or otherwise compromise) any Tax
Claim without the Sellers Representatives prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), provided, however, if the
Sellers Representative is not controlling and conducting the proceedings
relating to a Tax Claim and has not consented to a proposed settlement or
compromise of such Tax Claim by the Buyer, then at the request of the Buyer,
the Buyer and the Sellers Representative will submit the proposed settlement
or compromise to the Tax Matters Arbitrator to make a written determination
as to whether the proposed settlement or compromise is reasonable under the
circumstance and should be accepted and agreed to by the Sellers
Representative pursuant to the procedures described in Section 9.3(a) which
determination shall be final and binding.  
     

13.6 _Further Limitations and Qualifications on Indemnification._     

       | (a)   | Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: (i)
the Indemnified Parties shall have no right to indemnification with respect
to any loss of profits or any consequential or punitive damages, and (ii) the
Sellers shall have no liability under this Agreement with respect to any
matter to the extent the expense, loss or liability comprising the Loss with
respect to such matter has been reserved or provided for in the Interim
Financial Statements.  
---|---|--- 
      
     | (b)   | If at the Closing, (i) any Seller has given notice to
Buyer under this Agreement that any of the representations and warranties of
Company contained in Section 3 or any Seller in Section 4 is untrue, and (ii)
Buyer has a resulting right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
14.1, and Buyer elects to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
then Sellers shall have no liability or indemnification obligation hereunder
by reason of any such misrepresentation or breach of warranty.  
      
     | (c)   | The amount which the Indemnifying Party is required to
pay to, for, or on behalf of the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section
13 shall be reduced by any foreign, federal, state or local Income Tax
benefit to the Indemnified Party (including the Company and the Subsidiaries
in the case of Buyer) applicable to the indemnifiable Losses.  
      ##### 

  

   

       

-43-    

       | (d)   | The Indemnifying Party shall make any indemnification
payments determined to be payable to the Indemnified Party hereunder without
regard to any expectation that the Indemnified Party (including, for this
section in the case of the Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiaries) will
recover insurance proceeds or other amounts as a result of the matter giving
rise to the claim for which indemnification payments are to be made. If the
Indemnified Party receives any insurance proceeds or other amounts as a
result of the matter giving rise to any indemnification claim of the
Indemnified Party prior to the date upon which the Indemnifying Party is
given notice of the claim, the Indemnifying Partys indemnification
obligation with respect to such claim shall be reduced by the amount of any
such insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnified Party receives any insurance proceeds or other amounts as a
result of the matter giving rise to any indemnification claim of the
Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party after the Indemnifying Party
has paid such indemnification claim to the Indemnified Party, then the
Indemnified Party shall promptly turn over any such insurance proceeds or
other amounts received to the Indemnifying Party to the extent of the
payments made by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party on the
claim.  
---|---|--- 
      
     | (e)   | Other than in case of actual fraud, from and after
Closing, the sole recourse and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties arising out of this Agreement or
otherwise arising out of Buyers acquisition of the Stock, whether based on
tort, contract, statutory or common law remedy or equitable remedy or
otherwise, including but not limited to, any misrepresentation, breach of
warranty or otherwise, shall be to assert a claim for indemnification under
the indemnification provisions of this Section 13, and Buyer and Sellers each
covenant that it (and Indemnified Parties) will not seek to obtain any remedy
except as provided in this Section 13.  
      
     | (f)   | The indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to a specific claim for which
indemnification is provided under this Agreement shall extend beyond the time
period for indemnification set forth herein with respect to such specific
claim until it has been fully discharged or resolved or settled; provided,
however, written notice with reasonable specificity of the claim, the
estimate amount of the claim and the breach, inaccuracy, nonperformance or
provision of the Agreement to which such claim relates shall have been given
to the Indemnifying Party on or prior to end of such time period.  
      
     | (g)   | The Indemnified Party shall take reasonable steps to
mitigate any Losses.  
     

13.7 _Indemnification Adjustment to Purchase Price._     

 Any amounts payable by any of the Sellers under this Section 13 shall constitute a reduction in the Purchase Price and the Option Termination Amount, as appropriate.     ##### 

  

     

-44-    

13.8 _Certain Joint and Several Liability_     

 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (a) Hudson and Cameron Capital shall be jointly and severally liable for any amounts payable hereunder by either of them; (b) Martin and LMco shall be jointly and severally liable for any amounts payable hereunder by either of them.   

14\. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT.    

14.1 _Termination._     

 At any time prior to the Closing, this Agreement may be terminated: (i) by the mutual written agreement of Buyer and Sellers Representative; (ii) by Sellers Representative, if the Sellers and the Company are not in material breach of this Agreement, and, if there has been a material misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of agreement or covenant by Buyer in its representations, warranties, agreements and covenants set forth herein which misrepresentation or breach remains uncured on the earlier of (a) the date which is fifteen (15) days following Buyers receipt of written notice thereof from Sellers Representative and (b) December 21, 2004; (iii) by Buyer, if Buyer is not in material breach of this Agreement, and, if there has a been a misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of agreement or covenant by Sellers or the Company in their representations, warranties, agreements and covenants set forth herein which misrepresentation or breach (A) constitutes a Material Adverse Effect; and (B) remains uncured on the earlier of (a) the date which is fifteen (15) days following Sellers Representatives receipt of written notice thereof from Buyer and (b) December 21, 2004; (iv) by Buyer, upon written notice to the Sellers Representative within five (5) Business Days of receipt of a Supplement in the event that any matter set forth in such Supplement would have a Material Adverse Effect; provided that such matter has not been corrected on the earlier of (a) the date which is fifteen (15) days following delivery of such notice and (b) December 21, 2004; (v) by Buyer or Sellers Representative if the Closing has not occurred before the close of business on December 21, 2004, unless such Buyers or Sellers breach results in the failure of the Closing to occur by such date; or (vi) by Sellers Representative upon written notice to the Buyer at any time after receipt of a Buyer Reserve Notice (as defined in Section 15.8).   

14.2 _Notice of Termination._     

 In the event of termination by any party pursuant to Section 14.1, written notice setting forth the reasons therefore shall be given by the terminating party to the other parties.

15.8 _Supplements to Disclosure Schedule or Schedule 4._    

 From time to time prior to the Closing Date, Sellers Representative may supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule or Schedule 4 delivered pursuant to this Agreement: (a) if any matter hereafter arises which, if existing or occurring at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such supplemental or amended Disclosure Schedule or Schedule 4, as applicable to make the applicable representation true and correct; (b) to correct any information in the Disclosure Schedule or in Schedule 4 or in this Agreement which is inaccurate as a result of any matter resulting or arising after the date hereof; or (c) if otherwise contemplated by this Agreement. Any such supplement or amendment (a "Supplement"), upon written notice thereof to Buyer, shall be effective to modify this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule and Schedule 4, to qualify the representations and warranties contained in Sections 3 and 4 and to cure any misrepresentation or breach of warranty that otherwise might have existed under this Agreement for all purposes (any such modification, qualification or cure, collectively, an "Amendment"), including, without limitation, determination of the satisfaction of conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 9 and 10 hereof; provided, however, that if the matter or matters to which such Supplement relate would have a Material Adverse Effect, the Buyer may terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 14.1(iv), provided further, however, if such matter or matters to which such Supplement relate would not have a Material Adverse Effect, and if Buyer notifies Sellers Representative in writing within 4 Business Days after delivery of such Supplement that it elects not to have such Supplement be deemed on Amendment (a "Buyer Reserve Notice"), then such Supplement shall not be deemed an Amendment and Sellers Representative shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 14.1(vi).   

15.9 _Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits._     

       | (a)   | The Schedules shall be deemed to be attached hereto
and made a part hereof. All references herein to this Agreement shall include
the Schedules.  
---|---|--- 
      
     | (b)   | Nothing in the Schedules is intended to broaden the scope
of any representation or warranty contained in the Agreement. The Schedules
and the information and disclosures contained therein are intended only to
qualify and limit the representations, warranties and covenants of Sellers,
the Company or Buyer, as the case may be, contained in the Agreement and
shall not be deemed to expand in any way the scope or effect of any of
such representations, warranties or covenants.  
       ##### 

  

   

       

-49-    

       | (c)   | The disclosure of any item in any Schedules (or
section thereof), including for greater certainty in any Supplement, shall be
deemed disclosure of that item for all purposes for which disclosure is
required under this Agreement and in all appropriate sections of the
Schedules to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face that such
disclosure is applicable.  
---|---|--- 
      
     | (d)   | No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter
in any Schedule (or any section thereof) shall be construed as an admission
or indication that such item is required to be referred to or disclosed in
any Schedule (or any section thereof). Inclusion of any item in a Schedule
(or any section thereof) does not constitute a determination by the
representing party that such item is material and shall not be deemed to
establish a standard of materiality. No disclosure a Schedule (or any section
thereof) relating to any possible breach or violation of any agreement, law
or regulation or any potential adverse contingency shall be construed as an
admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred or that such adverse contingency will actually occur.  
     

15.10 _Disclaimer of Other Representations, Projections_     

 The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties made by the Company or the Sellers and expressly set forth in Sections 3 or 4, neither the Company, any Subsidiary, any Seller nor any representative thereof has made and shall not be construed as having made to the Buyer or to any representative thereof, and neither the Buyer nor any representative thereof has relied upon or regarded as material, any representation or warranty of any kind. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding any otherwise express representations and warranties made by the Company or the Seller in Sections 3 or 4, as applicable, the Buyer agrees that neither the Company, any Subsidiary, any Seller nor any representative thereof makes or has made any representation or warranty to the Buyer or any representative thereof with respect to:   

       | (a)   | (i) any projections, financial models, estimates,
forecasts or budgets contained in that certain confidential offering
memorandum, dated August, 2004 relating to the Company and the Subsidiaries
(the "Confidential Memorandum") or (ii) any projections, financial models,
estimates, forecasts or budgets relating to the business of the Company or
the Subsidiary otherwise heretofore or hereafter delivered to, presented to
(including, for greater certainty, in any management presentation) or made
available to the Buyer or its counsel, accountants, advisors, lenders,
representatives or affiliates ; and  
---|---|--- 
      
     | (b)   | any other information, statement or documents heretofore
or hereafter delivered to, presented to (including, for greater certainty, in
any management presentation) or made available to the Buyer or its counsel,
accountants, advisors, lenders, representatives or affiliates (including in
the Confidential Memorandum, the data room or otherwise) with respect to the
Company or the Subsidiaries or the business, operations or affairs of the
Company or the Subsidiaries, except to the extent and as expressly covered by
a representation and warranty contained in Sections 3 or 4.  
      ##### 

  

   

       

-50-    

 Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to any projections, financial models, estimates, forecasts or budgets relating to the business of the Company or the Subsidiary, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (i) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make any projections, financial models, estimates, forecasts or budgets, (ii) it is familiar with such uncertainties, (iii) it is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all such projections, financial models, estimates, forecasts or budgets so furnished to it, (iv) planned efficiencies or business opportunities may not materialize for a number of reasons, and (v) the Buyer shall have no claim against the Company, the Sellers or any of their directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, shareholders, partners or affiliates with respect thereto.   

15.11  _Severability._     

 Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law. If any portion of this Agreement is declared invalid for any reason in any jurisdiction, such declaration shall have no effect upon the remaining portions of this Agreement which shall continue in full force and effect as if this Agreement had been executed with the invalid portions thereof deleted; provided, however, if such severability will negate in any material respect the monetary terms of this Agreement, then the parties shall negotiate in good faith to amend the invalid terms in a manner so that such terms shall not be invalid and will not modify in any material respect the monetary terms of this Agreement unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Furthermore, the entirety of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in all other jurisdictions.   

15.12 _Entire Understanding._     

 This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supercedes any and all prior discussions, negotiations, letters of intent or agreements in principle between them.

 Except for the provisions of Section 13 relating to the Seller Indemnified Parties and the Buyer Indemnified Parties and Section 15.22 relating to the Sellers Representative Indemnified Parties and Section 15.23 relating to the Management Representative Indemnified Parties, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the exclusive benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to, nor shall it, confer in any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. The parties agree that, for the purpose of giving enforceable rights under this Agreement: (i) to the Buyer Indemnified Parties who are not party to this Agreement, Buyer is contracting as the agent of such Persons and will hold the rights of such Persons in trust for them; (ii) to the Seller Indemnified Parties who are not party to this agreement, each Seller is contracting as the agent of such Persons and will hold the rights of such Persons in trust for them; (iii) to the Sellers Representative Indemnified Parties who are not party to this agreement, the Sellers Representative is contracting as the agent of such Persons and will hold the rights of such Persons in trust for them; and (iv) to the Management Representative Indemnified Parties     ##### 

  

     

-51-    

who are not party to this agreement, the Management Representative is
contracting as the agent of such Persons and will hold the rights of such
Persons in trust for them.    

15.14 _Governing Law._     

 This Agreement is and shall be deemed to be a contract entered into and made pursuant to the laws of the Province of Ontario and shall in all respects be governed, construed, applied and enforced in accordance with the laws of said Province, without reference to its conflict of laws rules or principles.   

15.15 _Choice of Forum and Consent to Jurisdiction._     

 Any action arising out of or under this Agreement, any other document, instrument or agreement contemplated herein or delivered pursuant hereto, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of such other documents, instruments or agreements, shall be brought only in a federal or provincial court having jurisdiction and venue in Ontario, Canada, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that venue in Ontario is proper. Sellers hereby irrevocably designates, appoints and empowers (a) in the case of any Management Seller, Cameron Capital and (b) in the case of any other Seller, the Sellers Representative and its successors as its authorized special agent to receive, for and on behalf of Sellers, service of process in any such legal action or proceeding, a copy of such process to also be sent in the manner required above for notices to such party. Buyer hereby irrevocably designates, appoints and empowers Stikeman Elliott LLP and its successors, as its authorized special agent to receive, for and on behalf of Buyer and its affiliates, service of process in any such legal action or proceeding, a copy of such process to also be sent in the manner required above for notices to such party. To the extent permitted by applicable law, final judgment against such party (a certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and of the amount of any indebtedness of such party hereunder) in any such legal action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on an unsatisfied judgment or similar proceeding. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise, in any legal action or proceeding, any defense or any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named Ontario courts for any reason, including claims that such party may be immune from the above-described legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, or otherwise), or that such proceeding is brought in an inconvenient or otherwise improper forum or that this Agreement or any of the other aforementioned documents, instruments or agreements, or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts, or that the same are governed by the laws of a jurisdiction other than Ontario. Each of the parties hereby specifically agrees that it shall not bring any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or under this Agreement, any other document, instrument or agreement contemplated herein or delivered pursuant hereto, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of such other documents, instruments or agreements, in the courts of any jurisdiction other than the above-named courts of Ontario, that any such action brought by any party shall be dismissed upon the basis of the agreements, terms and provisions set forth in this Section 15.15, and that any order or judgment obtained in any such action from a court other than the courts of Ontario shall be void _ab initio_ provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 15.15, any party may bring and enforce an action seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.     #####

 EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM, SUIT, LITIGATION, ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PROVISION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED FOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY, AND THAT SUCH PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM SHALL INSTEAD BY TRIED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.   

15.17 _Assignability._     

       | (a)   | Except as set forth in Section 15.17(b) below or in
Section 7.1, no party hereto shall sell, pledge, assign or otherwise transfer
its rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto.  
---|---|--- 
      
     | (b)   | The Buyer may assign and transfer its rights and benefits
under this Agreement to any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Buyer, if such
subsidiary delivers to the Sellers Representative an instrument in writing
that it is bound by and shall perform the obligations of the Buyer under this
Agreement as if it were an original signatory hereto; provided that no such
sale, assignment or transfer shall release the Buyer from any of its
obligations hereunder.  
      
     | (c)   | In the event of an assignment contemplated by Section
15.17(b), any reference in this Agreement to the "Buyer" shall be deemed to
include such subsidiary.  
     

15.18 _Counterparts; Delivery by Facsimile._     

 This Agreement may be executed in counterparts and by each party hereto on a separate counterpart, all of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopier or facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.   

15.19 _Knowledge of Company._     

 For purposes of this Agreement, the term or phrase "Knowledge of the Company" shall mean and be limited to the actual knowledge of Steven K. Hudson, Fraser Clarke, Michael Brisson and David O Toole and without personal liability for any such knowledge.   

15.20 _Public Announcements._     

 No public announcements or other publicity regarding the transactions referred to herein shall be made by the Buyer, the Company or Sellers without the prior written approval of the other parties as to form, timing and manner of distribution or publications, except to the extent     ##### 

  

     

-53-    

otherwise required by law or stock exchange rules, except that each party may
disclose to their current and prospective banks, shareholders, partners,
investors and advisors the name of the other party, the date of the
transaction, the price and the key terms under this Agreement and except that
the EdgeStone Group may disclose information regarding its investment in the
Company and the disposition thereof (including relevant terms) in connection
with fund raising activities.    

15.21 _Mutual Drafting._      

 The parties hereto are sophisticated and have been represented by lawyers throughout the transactions contemplated hereby who have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence, the parties do not intend that any presumptions or rules related to the interpretation of contracts against the drafter or any particular clause should be applied to this Agreement and therefore waive their effects.   

15.22 _Sellers  Representative._    

       | (a)   | The Sellers Representative, on the terms hereafter
set out, shall act for the Sellers with respect to the calculation of the
Purchase Price, with respect to the execution of all agreements and documents
(including the Escrow Agreement and the Exchange Fund Agreement) and the
making of all deliveries required to be made by the Sellers hereunder, with
respect to the waiver of any condition under, and the decision to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to, Sections 11 or 14, with respect to claims for
indemnification made under Section 13 by the Buyer Indemnified Parties, with
respect to claims by the Sellers against the Buyer made under Section 13,
with respect to amendments to this Agreement, provided that such amendment
shall not adversely affect the rights of any particular Seller or increase
the liability or potential liability of any particular Seller in a manner
which is not consistent with the manner in which the rights, liabilities or
potential liabilities of the other Sellers are to be affected, with respect
to amendments to the Schedules as contemplated by Section 15.8 and with
respect to any other decision or consent to be made by the Sellers hereunder,
provided however that (i) the Sellers Representative shall not act for a
particular Seller in respect of any matter relating to a claim
for indemnification specific to a particular Seller only, and (ii) if the
Management Representative has specific authority under Section 15.23 to act
for the Management Sellers then the Sellers Representative shall have no
authority to act for the Management Sellers in connection with such matter.
For greater certainty, the assumption by the Sellers Representative of the
responsibilities set out in this Section 15.22 does not make any Seller
liable for more than their respective Pro Rata Liability Share of any claim
by the Buyer Indemnified Parties. In each such case in this Agreement, the
Buyer shall be entitled to direct all communications through, and rely on
decisions made by, the Sellers Representative. With respect to all such
matters, the Sellers Representative may (i) take any and all actions
(including without limitation executing and delivering any documents),
incurring any costs and expenses for the account of the Sellers and make any
and all determinations which may be required or  
---|---|--- 
       ##### 

  

     

-54-    

       |   | permitted to be taken by the Sellers under this
Agreement, including in connection with Sections 11 or 14 of this Agreement,
(ii) exercise such other rights, power and authority as are authorized,
delegated and granted to the Sellers Representative under this Agreement,
(iii) dispute or refrain from disputing any claim made by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties under this Agreement, (iv) negotiate and compromise any
dispute that may arise under and exercise or refrain from exercising any
remedies available under this Agreement, (v) execute any settlement
agreement, release or other document with respect to such dispute or remedy,
and (vi) exercise such rights, power and authority as are incidental to the
foregoing.  
---|---|--- 
      
     | (b)   | Each of the Sellers acts through the Sellers
Representative with respect to the matters set out in Section 15.22(a) and
none of the Sellers have the right to act independently with respect to any
such matter or to institute or participate in any suit, action or proceeding,
now existing or hereafter arising, against or by the Buyer with respect to
this Agreement, any such right being irrevocably and exclusively with the
Sellers Representative. Notwithstanding any disagreement or dispute among
the Sellers or between any of the Sellers and the Sellers Representative,
the Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any and all action taken by the
Sellers Representative under this Agreement with respect to matters set out
in Section 15.22(a), without any liability to, or obligation to inquire of,
any of the Sellers.  
      
     | (c)   | The power and authority of the Sellers Representative,
as described in this Agreement, shall be effective until all rights and
obligations of the Sellers under this Agreement, have terminated, expired or
been fully performed. Each of the Sellers shall promptly do, make, execute,
deliver, or cause to be done, made, executed or delivered, all such further
acts, documents and things as the Sellers Representative may require from
time to time for the purpose of giving effect to this Section 15.22 and shall
use best efforts and take all such steps as may be within its power to
implement to their full extent the provisions of this Section 15.22.  
      
     | (d)   | Each of the Sellers shall severally indemnify and hold
the Sellers Representative (including, for greater certainty, the
shareholders, general and limited partners, officers, directors, employees,
agents and affiliates of the Sellers Representative) (the "Sellers
Representative Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against such Sellers
Pro Rata Liability Share of any loss, damage or deficiencies (except as a
result from the Sellers Representatives willful misconduct as determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction) that the Sellers Representative
Indemnified Parties may suffer or incur in connection with any action taken
by the Sellers Representative. Each of the Sellers (including the members of
the EdgeStone Group) shall bear its Pro Rata Liability Share of such loss,
damage or deficiency. The Sellers Representative Indemnified Parties shall
not be liable to any of the Sellers with respect to any action or omission
taken or omitted to be taken by the Sellers Representative pursuant to this
Section 15.22, except in respect of the Sellers Representatives willful
misconduct as determined by a court of  
      ##### 

  

   

       

-55-    

       |   | competent jurisdiction. The Sellers Representative
Indemnified Parties shall not be responsible in any manner whatsoever for any
failure or inability of the Buyer to honor any of the provisions of this
Agreement. The Sellers Representative Indemnified Parties shall be fully
protected by the Sellers in acting or relying upon any written notice,
direction, request, waiver, notice, consent, receipt or other paper or
document which the Sellers Representative in good faith believes to be
genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
The Sellers Representative Indemnified Parties shall not be liable to the
Sellers or the Buyer for any error of judgment, or any act done or step taken
or omitted in good faith or for any mistake in fact or law, or for anything
which it may do or refrain from doing in connection herewith, except for its
own willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.  
---|---|--- 
      
     | (e)   | The Sellers Representative may seek the advice of legal
counsel, engage experts or otherwise incur reasonable expenses in the event
of any dispute or question as to the construction of any of the provisions of
this Agreement, or its duties hereunder, and the Sellers Representative
Indemnified Parties shall incur no liability to the Sellers with respect to
any action taken, omitted or suffered by it in good faith in accordance with
the opinion of such counsel or advice of such expert.  
      
     | (f)   | The Sellers shall severally reimburse or otherwise hold
the Sellers Representative Indemnified Parties harmless from and against
their Pro Rata Liability Share of any and all costs and expenses incurred by
the Sellers Representative in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including attorneys fees or fees of other
experts, and, in addition to any and all other remedies available, the
Sellers Representative Indemnified Parties shall have the right to direct
that any amounts due to the Sellers under this Agreement be paid to the
Sellers Representative Indemnified Parties to satisfy such costs and
expenses.  
      
     | (g)   | The Sellers Representative may resign at any time upon
thirty days notice by submitting a written resignation to the Management
Representative. In the case of the resignation of the Sellers
Representative, the EdgeStone Group shall promptly appoint a successor.  
      
     | (h)   | By execution and delivery of this Agreement by such
Seller or his or her representative, agent or attorney, each of the Sellers
hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Sellers Representative as
the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of such Seller, which
appointment is coupled with an interest, with full authority and power of
substitution, except to the extent expressly provided to the contrary herein,
to act in the name, place and stead of such Seller with respect to all powers
and rights in this Agreement (including without limitation to (i) amend or
terminate this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement, (ii) receive or
deliver any and all notices to be delivered to or by any of the Sellers
hereunder, (iii) receive, hold and deliver to the Buyer Stock certificates
and any other documents (including  
     ##### 

  

   

       

-56-    

       |   | stock powers or other instruments or transfer relating
thereto, and (iv) execute, acknowledge, deliver, record and file all
ancillary agreements, certificates and documents which the Sellers
Representative deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
terms and provisions of this Agreement). Buyer and each of the Sellers hereby
acknowledges that the Sellers Representative, with respect to the matters
set out in this Section 15.22, will not be acting in such Persons individual
capacity pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, but solely in its capacity
as the Sellers Representative (and accordingly, as a representative of the
Sellers). Buyer and each of the Sellers hereby agrees that the Sellers
Representative will not be liable to that party for any action taken or
omitted in good faith in its capacity as the Sellers Representative.  
---|---|--- 
     

15.23 _Management Representative._     

       | (a)   | The Management Representative, on the terms hereafter
set out, shall act for the Management Sellers with respect to any claim for
indemnification made under Section 13 by the Buyer Indemnified Parties (other
than relating to third party claims or a Tax Claim). For greater certainty,
the assumption by the Management Representative of the responsibilities set
out in this Section 15.23 does not make any of Management Sellers liable for
more than their respective Pro Rata Liability Share of any claim by the
Buyer Indemnified Parties. In each such case in this Agreement, the Buyer
shall be entitled to direct all communications to the Management Sellers
through, and rely on decisions made by, the Management Representative. With
respect to all such matters, the Management Representative may (i) take any
and all actions (including without limitation executing and delivering
any documents), incurring any costs and expenses for the account of
the Management Sellers and making any and all determinations which may
be required or permitted to be taken by the Management Representative
under this Agreement, (ii) exercise such other rights, power and authority as
are authorized, delegated and granted to the Management Representative
under this Agreement, (iii) dispute or refrain from disputing any claim made
by the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this Agreement against the
Management Sellers, (iv)with respect to the Management Sellers,
negotiate and compromise any dispute that may arise under and exercise or
refrain from exercising any remedies available under this Agreement, (v)
execute any settlement agreement, release or other document with respect to
such dispute or remedy, and (vi) exercise such rights, power and authority as
are incidental to the foregoing.  
---|---|--- 
      
     | (b)   | Each of the Management Sellers acts through the
Management Representative with respect to the matters set out in Section
15.23(a) and none of the Management Sellers have the right to act
independently with respect to any such matter or to institute or participate
in any suit, action or proceeding, now existing or hereafter arising, against
or by the Buyer with respect to this Agreement, any such right being
irrevocably and exclusively with the Management Representative.
Notwithstanding any disagreement or dispute  
      ##### 

  

   

       

-57-    

       |   | among the Management Sellers or between any of the
Management Sellers and the Management Representative, the Buyer shall be
entitled to rely on any and all action taken by the Management Representative
under this Agreement with respect to matters set out in Section 15.23(a),
without any liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any of the Management
Sellers.  
---|---|--- 
      
     | (c)   | The power and authority of the Management Representative,
as described in this Agreement, shall be effective until all rights and
obligations of the Management Sellers under this Agreement, have terminated,
expired or been fully performed. Each of the Management Sellers shall
promptly do, make, execute, deliver, or cause to be done, made, executed or
delivered, all such further acts, documents and things as the Management
Representative may require from time to time for the purpose of giving effect
to this Section 15.23 and shall use best efforts and take all such steps as
may be within its power to implement to their full extent the provisions of
this Section 15.23.  
      
     | (d)   | Each of the Management Sellers shall severally indemnify
and hold the Management Representative (including, for greater certainty, his
heirs, executors and personal representatives) (the "Management
Representative Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against such
Management Sellers proportionate share (relative to the other Management
Shareholders) of any loss, damage or deficiencies (except as a result from
the Management Representatives willful misconduct as determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction) that the Management Representative Indemnified
Parties may suffer or incur in connection with any action taken by the
Management Representative. Each of the Management Sellers (including the
members of the Hudson Group) shall bear his, her or its proportionate share
(relative to the other Management Shareholders) of such loss, damage or
deficiency. The Management Representative Indemnified Parties shall not be
liable to any of the Management Sellers with respect to any action or
omission taken or omitted to be taken by the Management Representative
pursuant to this Section 15.23, except in respect of the Management
Representatives willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction. The Management Representative Indemnified Parties shall not be
responsible in any manner whatsoever for any failure or inability of the
Buyer to honor any of the provisions of this Agreement. The Management
Representative Indemnified Parties shall be fully protected by the Management
Sellers in acting or relying upon any written notice, direction, request,
waiver, notice, consent, receipt or other paper or document which the
Management Representative in good faith believes to be genuine and to have
been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Management
Representative Indemnified Parties shall not be liable to the Management
Sellers or the Buyer for any error of judgment, or any act done or step taken
or omitted in good faith or for any mistake in fact or law, or for anything
which it may do or refrain from doing in connection herewith, except for its
own willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.  
      ##### 

  

   

       

-58-    

       | (e)   | The Management Representative may seek the advice of
legal counsel, engage experts or otherwise incur reasonable expenses in the
event of any dispute or question as to the construction of any of the
provisions of this Agreement, or its duties hereunder, and the Management
Representative Indemnified Parties shall incur no liability to the Management
Sellers with respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it in good
faith in accordance with the opinion of such counsel or advice of such
expert.  
---|---|--- 
      
     | (f)   | Each of the Management Sellers shall severally reimburse
or otherwise hold the Management Representative Indemnified Parties harmless
from and against his, her or its proportionate share (relative to the other
Management Shareholders) of any and all costs and expenses incurred by the
Management Representative in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including attorneys fees or fees of other
experts, and, in addition to any and all other remedies available,
the Management Representative Indemnified Parties shall have the right to
direct that any amounts due to the Management Sellers under this Agreement be
paid to the Management Representative Indemnified Parties to satisfy such
costs and expenses.  
      
     | (g)   | By execution and delivery of this Agreement by such
Management Seller or his or her representative, agent or attorney, each of
the Management Sellers hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the
Management Representative as the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact
of such Management Seller which appointment is coupled with an interest, with
full authority and power of substitution, except to the extent expressly
provided to the contrary herein, to act in the name, place and stead of such
Management Seller with respect to the matters set out in Section 15.23(a)
(including without limitation to receive or deliver any and all notices to be
delivered to or by any of the Management Sellers hereunder). Buyer and each
of the Management Sellers hereby acknowledges that the Management
Representative, with respect to the matters set out in this Section 15.23,
will not be acting in such Persons individual capacity pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, but solely in its capacity as the Management
Representative (and accordingly, as a representative of the Management
Sellers). Buyer and each of the Management Sellers hereby agrees that the
Management Representative will not be liable to that party for any action
taken or omitted in good faith in its capacity as the Management
Representative.  
     

15.24 _Morton Option Termination_     

 Morton hereby agrees that, effective automatically upon the Closing, the Options held by him and any and all option agreements, plans or other agreements or documents of any kind relating to options or other rights to acquire Common Shares (other than this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any other agreement executed and delivered in connection herewith), shall terminate and become null and void and Morton shall have no further rights thereunder and that the Company and its subsidiaries are released from any obligation pursuant to such matters.    #####
