General Electric Capital Corporation ("PARENT"), a Delaware corporation, Hawk

the Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and the Company have each

common stock, par value $0.25 per share, of the Company ("CLASS A COMMON
STOCK") and all of the shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.25 per
share, of the Company (the "CLASS B COMMON STOCK") (all such shares of Class
A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, "SHARES") that are issued and
outstanding for $53.75 per Share (such amount, or any greater amount per
Share paid pursuant to the Offer, being the "PER SHARE AMOUNT"), net to the
seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and the Offer;   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company
(the "BOARD") has approved the making of the Offer by Purchaser and resolved
to recommend that holders of Shares tender their Shares pursuant to the
Offer;   WHEREAS, also in furtherance of such acquisition, the Boards
of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and the Company have each approved this
Agreement and declared its advisability and approved the merger (the

OFFER  ---------   Section 1.01 The Offer.   (a) Provided that none of
the events set forth in Annex A hereto shall have occurred or be continuing
(other than the requirements set forth in clauses (i)-(iv) of Annex A),
Purchaser shall commence the Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof, but in no event later than 5 business days after the
initial public announcement of Purchaser\'s intention to commence the Offer.
The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to
the Offer shall be subject to the satisfaction of each of the conditions set
forth in Annex A hereto. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive any
such condition, to increase the price per Share payable in the Offer, and to
make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; provided,
however, that no change may be made which decreases the price per Share
payable in the Offer or which reduces the maximum number of Shares to be
purchased in the Offer or which imposes conditions to the Offer in
addition to those set forth in Annex A; and provided further that the
condition in clause (iv) of Annex A may not be waived by Purchaser nor may
any change be made to such condition without the consent of the Company.
Purchaser shall from time to time extend the Offer beyond the scheduled
expiration date, which shall initially be 20 business days following the
commencement of the Offer, for up to 5 business days in each instance (or for
such different period to which the Company shall reasonably agree) if, at the
scheduled expiration of the Offer, any of the conditions to Purchaser\'s
obligation to accept for payment Shares shall not be satisfied or waived. In
addition, if all of the conditions to the Offer are satisfied or waived but
the number of shares of Class A Common Stock validly tendered and not
withdrawn, together with the shares of Class A Common Stock held by Parent
and Purchaser, if any, is less than ninety percent (90%) of the then-
outstanding number of shares of Class A Common Stock (assuming the conversion
by Parent of all shares of Class B Common Stock to Class A Common Stock as
contemplated by the last sentence of this Section 1.01(a)), then upon the
applicable expiration date of the Offer, Purchaser shall provide
"subsequent offering periods," as such term is defined in, and in accordance
with, Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, for an aggregate period not to
exceed twenty (20) business days (for all such extensions) and Purchaser
shall (A) give the required notice of such subsequent offering period and (B)
immediately accept and promptly pay for all Shares tendered as of such
applicable expiration date. Subject to the terms of the Offer, Purchaser
shall accept for payment and pay for all Shares at the earliest time at which
it is permitted to do so under applicable law. Purchaser shall take all
necessary action to cause all shares of Class B Common Stock so accepted to
be converted to shares of Class A Common Stock as promptly as practicable on
the date such shares are accepted by Purchaser or on any subsequent date
prior to the Effective Time if, and only if, such conversion would permit
Purchaser to acquire shares of Class A Common Stock representing at least 90%
of the then outstanding Class A Common Stock.   (b) The Per Share Amount
shall, subject to applicable withholding of Taxes (as hereinafter defined),
be net to the seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
the Offer. Purchaser shall pay for all Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn promptly following the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to
the Offer. Notwithstanding the      -3-      immediately preceding
sentence and subject to the applicable rules of the SEC and the terms and
conditions of the Offer, Purchaser expressly reserves the right to delay
payment for Shares in order to comply in whole or in part with applicable
laws. Any such delay shall be effected in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT"). If the
payment equal to the Per Share Amount in cash is to be made to a person other
than the person in whose name the surrendered certificate formerly evidencing
Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be
a condition of payment that the certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed
properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Amount to a person other
than the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or shall
have established to the satisfaction of Purchaser that such Taxes either have
been paid or are not applicable.   (c) As promptly as reasonably
practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, Purchaser shall file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, the "SCHEDULE TO") with respect to the
Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or shall incorporate by reference an
offer to purchase (the "OFFER TO PURCHASE") and forms of the related letter
of transmittal and any related summary advertisement (the Schedule TO, the
Offer to Purchase and such other documents, together with all supplements and
amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the "OFFER
DOCUMENTS"). Parent, Purchaser and the Company agree to correct promptly any
information provided by any of them for use in the Offer Documents that shall
have become false or misleading, and Parent and Purchaser further agree to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC, and the other Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable federal securities laws to give effect to the Offer. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon the Offer Documents and all amendments and supplements thereto
prior to their filing with the SEC.   Section 1.02 Company Action.   (a)
The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and represents that
the Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has (A) determined that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including each of the
Offer and the Merger (collectively, the "TRANSACTIONS"), are fair to, and
in the best interests of, the holders of Shares, (B) approved, adopted and
declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions (such approval and
adoption having been made in accordance with the DGCL, including, without
limitation, Section 203 thereof), and (C) resolved to recommend that the
holders of Shares accept the Offer and tender Shares pursuant to the Offer,
and approve and adopt this Agreement and the Transactions; provided, however,
that such recommendation may be withdrawn, modified or amended to the extent
that the Board determines in good faith following consultation with outside
legal counsel that failure to take such action would constitute a breach of
the Board\'s fiduciary obligations under applicable law. The Company hereby
consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of the
Board described in and subject to the immediately preceding sentence. The
Board has also received the opinions of even date herewith (the "OPINIONS")
of Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation and Lehman Brothers, Inc.,
financial advisors to the Company, to the effect that, as of such date, the
Per Share Amount to be      -4-      received by holders of Shares
and the Merger Consideration (as hereinafter defined) to be received by such
stockholders pursuant to the Merger is fair to such stockholders, other than
the Principal Stockholder, from a financial point of view.   (b)
Concurrently with the filing of the Schedule TO by Purchaser, the Company
shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "SCHEDULE
14D-9") containing the recommendation of the Board described in Section
1.02(a), and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to the extent required by
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and any other
applicable federal securities laws to give effect to the Offer. The Company,
Parent and Purchaser agree to correct promptly any information provided by
any of them for use in the Schedule 14D-9 which shall have become false or
misleading, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to
cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 and
all amendments and supplements thereto prior to their filing with the
SEC.   (c) The Company shall promptly furnish Purchaser with mailing
labels containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and
with security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as
of a recent date, together with all other available listings and computer
files containing names, addresses and security position listings of record
holders and beneficial owners of Shares. The Company shall promptly furnish
Purchaser with such additional information, including, without limitation,
updated listings and computer files of stockholders, mailing labels and
security position listings, and such other assistance in disseminating the
Offer Documents to holders of Shares as Parent or Purchaser may reasonably
request. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, and except for such
steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and
Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information contained in such labels,
listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the
Transactions, and, if this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with
Section 8.01, shall deliver to the Company all copies of such information
then in their possession.   ARTICLE II   THE MERGER  ----------  
Section 2.01 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VII, and in accordance with the DGCL, Purchaser shall be
merged with and into the Company.   Section 2.02 Effective Time; Closing. As
promptly as practicable after the consummation of the Offer, the parties
hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing this Agreement or a
certificate of merger or certificate of ownership and merger (in either case,
the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with,
the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of such filing being
the "EFFECTIVE TIME"). Prior to such filing, a closing (the     
-5-      "CLOSING") shall be held at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and
Manges, LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10153, or such other place
as the parties shall agree, at a time and on a date to be specified by the
parties, which shall be no later than the second business day after
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions).   Section 2.03
Effect of the Merger. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Purchaser shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation of the Merger (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION"). At the
Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Purchaser shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and Purchaser shall
become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   Section 2.04 Certificate of
Incorporation; Bylaws.   (a) At the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and such
Certificate of Incorporation.   (b) Unless otherwise determined by Parent
prior to the Effective Time, the By-laws of the Purchaser, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such By-
laws.   Section 2.05 Directors and Officers. The directors of
Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance
with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in
each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified.   Section 2.06 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser,
the Company or the holders of any of the following securities:   (a) Each
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.06(b) and any Dissenting
Shares (as hereinafter defined)) shall be canceled and shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive an amount equal to the Per Share
Amount (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION") payable, without interest, to the holder
of such Share, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.09, of the
certificate that formerly evidenced such share;      -6-       (b)
Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by
Purchaser, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made
with respect thereto;   (c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.25 per
share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of Class A common stock, par value $0.25 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation; and   (d) Each share of Noncumulative
Perpetual Senior Preferred Stock, Series C, par value $0.01 per share
("SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK") and Noncumulative Perpetual Senior Preferred
Stock, Series D, par value $0.01 per share ("SERIES D PREFERRED STOCK") shall
remain outstanding at and after the Effective Time and shall continue to
evidence an equity interest in the Surviving Corporation in accordance with
the terms thereof. Each of the Company\'s 7% Mandatory Enhanced Dividend
Securities Units (the "MEDS") shall be adjusted pursuant to the terms
thereof.   Section 2.07 Employee Stock Options; Restricted Stock; Stock
Units. At the Effective Time, all (i) options ("COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS") to
purchase Shares, (ii) stock units, share units or stock equivalent units held
in the Company Stock Funds under the Company\'s Executive Deferred
Compensation Plan and Deferral Restoration Plan or awarded pursuant to an
individual unit agreement (each, a "COMPANY STOCK UNIT") and (iii) restricted
shares and other equity based awards (collectively, "COMPANY STOCK AWARDS")
then outstanding, whether under the Company\'s 1998 Stock Incentive Plan (the
"COMPANY STOCK OPTION PLAN") or otherwise, shall be treated in accordance
with Section 6.09 of this Agreement.   Section 2.08 Dissenting Shares.  
(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
are held by stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger
nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in
writing appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (collectively, the "DISSENTING SHARES") shall not be converted into,
or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such
stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section
262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their
rights to appraisal of such Shares under such Section 262 shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as
of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.09,
of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares.  
(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The      -7-      Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any
such demands. This Section 2.08(b) shall apply to the Shares as well as
any other shares of capital stock of the Company, the holders of which shall
be entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL.   Section 2.09 Surrender of
Shares; Stock Transfer Books.   (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser
shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company
to act as agent (the "PAYING AGENT") for the holders of Shares to receive the
funds to which holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 2.06(a). Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by the Surviving Corporation.   (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each person who was, at the
Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.06(a) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the certificates evidencing such shares (the "CERTIFICATES") shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant
to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such
Certificate shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on
the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate for
the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If the payment equal to the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the surrendered certificate formerly evidencing Shares is registered on
the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment
that the certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment
shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Purchaser that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
applicable.   (c) At any time following the sixth month after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent
and not disbursed to holders of Shares (including, without limitation, all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all
funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled
to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
and other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Share for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
law.      -8-       (d) At the close of business on the day of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company with respect to the
Shares shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable law.   (e) The
Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold) from the
consideration otherwise payable in the Merger to any holder of Shares such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to Taxes. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 
---------------------------------------------   Except as set forth in a
correspondingly numbered section of the written disclosure schedule
previously delivered by the Company to Parent and Purchaser (the "COMPANY
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE") the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as
follows:   Section 3.01 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. Each
of the Company and its subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly
existing and (to the extent the concept of good standing exists in the
applicable jurisdiction) in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction
of its organization and has the requisite corporate or other power and
authority necessary to own, lease and operate the properties it purports to
own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in good
standing or to have such power or authority would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries
is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is
in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. A list of all subsidiaries of the
Company together with the jurisdiction of organization of each such
subsidiary and the percentage of each such subsidiary\'s outstanding capital
stock owned by the Company or another subsidiary of the Company (in the case
of any non-U.S. subsidiaries, without giving effect to any qualifying share
ownerships of less than 1%) is contained in Section 3.01 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. Except as set forth in Section 3.01 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries directly
or indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar
interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business
association or entity (other than its wholly-owned subsidiaries),
with respect to which securities the Company or a subsidiary has invested
(and currently owns) or is required to invest $10,000,000 or more,
excluding securities in any publicly-traded company held for investment by
the Company and comprising less than five percent of the     
-9-      outstanding stock of such company acquired in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with past practice.   Section 3.02
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws. The Company has heretofore made
available to Parent a complete and correct copy of its Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws, each as
amended to date (the "COMPANY CHARTER DOCUMENTS"), and has made available to
Parent the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws (or
equivalent organizational documents) of each of its subsidiaries requested by
Parent (the "SUBSIDIARY DOCUMENTS"). All such Company Charter Documents and
Subsidiary Documents are in full force and effect, except in the case of
Subsidiary Documents where the failure to be in full force and effect would
not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to have
a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is
in violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or
By-laws or equivalent organizational documents, except for violations of the
documents which would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.03
Capitalization.   (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of 500,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, 300,000,000 shares of Class B

restricted shares) and 51,050,000 shares of Class B Common Stock were issued

issued in violation of preemptive or similar rights, (ii) no Shares were held
by subsidiaries of the Company, (iii) 1,500,000 shares of Series C Preferred
Stock and 1,250,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock were issued and

existing grants pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plan, (v) 51,050,000
shares of Class A Common Stock were reserved and available for future

shares of Class A Common Stock were reserved for future issuance in
connection with the MEDS. No change in such capitalization has occurred from
July 23, 2001 to the date hereof, except for changes resulting from the
exercise or termination of Company Stock Options. Except (i) as set forth in
Section 3.01, this Section 3.03 or Section 3.11, (ii) for the conversion
provisions of the Class B Common Stock and (iii) for the Registration Rights
Agreement, there are no options, warrants or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character (including, without
limitation, registration rights) binding on the Company or any of its
subsidiaries relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to issue, sell or register any shares
of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any of its
subsidiaries. All shares of the Class A Common Stock subject to issuance as
aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the

validly issued, fully-paid and nonassessable.      -10-       (b)
Except as set forth in the reports, schedules, forms, statements,
registration statements, proxy statements and other documents filed by the
Company with the SEC since December 31, 2000 and prior to the date of this
Agreement, including those incorporated therein by reference prior to
the date of this Agreement (the "COMPANY SEC DOCUMENTS"), and except for
the conversion provisions of the Class B Common Stock, there are no
obligations, contingent or otherwise, of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Shares or the
capital stock of any subsidiary. Except as set forth in the Company SEC
Documents, there are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries to provide funds to or make any investment (in the
form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any such subsidiary or
any other entity other than financing or lending arrangements of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries as a lender or a financing provider entered into
in the ordinary course of business (the "ORDINARY COURSE FINANCE
Agreements"), equity investments made in the ordinary course of business and
guarantees of bank obligations of subsidiaries entered into in the ordinary
course of business. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock (other
than directors\' qualifying shares) of each of the Company\'s subsidiaries
are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and all
such shares (other than directors\' qualifying shares and a de minimis number
of shares owned by employees of such subsidiaries as set forth in Section
3.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule) are owned by the Company or another
subsidiary free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims, pledges,
agreements, limitations in the Company\'s voting rights, charges or other
encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.   Section 3.04 Authority Relative to
this Agreement.   (a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Keep Well Letter
Agreement (as hereinafter defined) and to perform its obligations hereunder
and thereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the Keep Well Letter Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement and the Keep Well Letter Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the adoption of this
Agreement by holders of a majority of the voting power of the then-
outstanding Shares, if and to the extent required by applicable law, and the
filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the
DGCL).   (b) The Board of Directors of the Company has, by unanimous vote
of those present (who constituted 100% of the directors then in office)
approved this Agreement, the Keep Well Letter Agreement and the Transactions
and such approvals are sufficient so that the restrictions on business
combinations set forth in Section 203(a) of the DGCL shall not apply to the
Merger. The Company Board has, by unanimous vote of those present (who
constitute 100% of the directors then in office), approved of a modification
to the Keep Well Agreement to allow the Principal Stockholder to sell its
shares of Class B Common Stock to Purchaser as provided in the Support
Agreement.   (c) This Agreement and the Keep Well Letter Agreement have been
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the
due authorization, execution      -11-      and delivery by Parent
and Purchaser of this Agreement and the Keep Well Letter Agreement,
constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with their respective terms.   Section
3.05 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.   (a) The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Keep Well Letter Agreement by the Company
do not, and the performance of this Agreement and the Keep Well Letter
Agreement by the Company will not, (i) conflict with or violate the Company
Charter Documents, or (ii) conflict with or violate the Subsidiary Documents
or any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or by which its or any of their respective
properties is bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach of or
constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) under, or impair the Company\'s or any of
its subsidiaries\' rights or alter the rights or obligations of any third
party under, or give to others any rights of, or cause any, termination,
amendment, redemption, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a lien or encumbrance on (including a right to purchase) any of
the properties or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant
to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, credit facility, contract,
agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries or its or any of their
respective properties is bound or affected, except, in the case of clause
(ii) or (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or
other occurrences that would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b) The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Keep Well Letter Agreement by the Company
do not, and the performance of this Agreement and the Keep Well Letter
Agreement by the Company will not, require the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to make or seek any consent, approval, authorization or permit
of, or filing with or notification to, any governmental, administrative or
regulatory authority, U.S. and non-U.S. (each, a "GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY"),
except (i) (I) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder (the
"SECURITIES ACT") and the Exchange Act, (II) for applicable requirements, if
any, under state securities laws, (III) the pre-merger notification
requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "HSR ACT"),
(IV) filings and consents under any applicable non-United States laws
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade ("NON-U.S. MONOPOLY LAWS"),
including, without limitation, filings and consents under the Council
Regulation (EEC) No. 4064/89, as amended (the "EC MERGER REGULATION"), (V)
filings and consents as may be required under any environmental, health or
safety law or regulation pertaining to any notification, disclosure or
required approval triggered by the Merger or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement ("ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS"), and (VI) the filing
and recordation of appropriate merger or other documents as required by the
DGCL, (ii) (I) for the filing of applications and notices, as applicable,
with the U.S. federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities regarding
consumer and commercial finance, mortgage and real estate lending and small
business lending, brokers, dealers, insurance and other financial services,
and with self-regulatory organizations regulating brokers, dealers,
investment advisors, investment companies, insurance companies and other
financial services firms, (II) the filing of     
-12-      applications and notices, as applicable, with federal housing
related authorities, and the approval of such applications by such

France) regulating banking, consumer and commercial finance, mortgage
lending, insurance and other financial services in the foreign jurisdictions
in which the Company operates its business or to which it is otherwise
subject, and the approval of such applications by such authorities (all of
the foregoing in this clause (ii), collectively, the "REGULATORY APPROVALS"),
(iii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or
permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Merger, or otherwise prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Offer or the Merger, or otherwise
prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its material
obligations under this Agreement, or would not otherwise reasonably
be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
Effect, or (iv) as to which any necessary consents, approvals,
authorizations, permits, filings or notifications have heretofore been
obtained or filed, as the case may be, by the Company.   Section 3.06
Compliance; Permits.   (a) Except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents,
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is (or has been as a result
of which it could reasonably be expected now or in the future to have
material liability) in conflict with, or in breach, default or violation of,
(i) any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or by which its or any of their respective
properties is bound or affected, (ii) any note, bond, debenture, indenture,
credit agreement or facility or commercial paper facility pursuant to which
the Company or any of its subsidiaries has or may incur indebtedness for
borrowed money (a "COMPANY FINANCING AGREEMENT") or any security, pledge,
mortgage or trust agreement or arrangement in respect of any Company
Financing Agreement or (iii) any other contract, agreement, lease, license,
permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or
any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or its or any of their respective properties is bound or
affected (including any note, bond, debenture, indenture, credit agreement or
facility or commercial paper facility not included in clause (ii) above or
any security, pledge, mortgage or trust agreement or arrangement in respect
of any of the foregoing), except for any such conflicts, defaults
or violations which would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Except as set forth
in the Company SEC Documents, the Company and its subsidiaries hold all
permits, licenses, easements, variances, exemptions, consents, certificates,
orders and approvals from governmental authorities which are material to the
operation of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, as it is now being conducted (collectively, the "COMPANY PERMITS"),
except where the failure to hold such Company Permits would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
Effect. The Company and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of
the Company Permits, and have not failed to comply therewith as a result of
which they would reasonably be expected to have liability now or in the
future, except as described in the Company SEC Documents or where the failure
to so comply would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.      -13-      
Section 3.07 SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Regulatory Filings.   (a)
The Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents (including all exhibits) required to be filed with the SEC since
December 31, 1998 (the "POST-1998 COMPANY SEC Documents"). Except
as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents, such reports, schedules,
forms, statements and other documents (i) complied in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
as the case may be, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then
on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. To the Company\'s knowledge, no
investigation by the SEC with respect to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is pending or threatened.   (b) Each of the consolidated
financial statements (including, in each case, any related notes thereto)
contained in the Post-1998 Company SEC Documents was prepared in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or in the
Post-1998 Company SEC Documents) ("GAAP") throughout the periods involved,
and each fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof
and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the periods
indicated, except that for purposes of the foregoing representation, the
unaudited interim financial statements (i) shall be read in conjunction with
the Company\'s consolidated financial statements contained in the Company\'s
2000 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and (ii) were or are subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments which were not or are not expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to be material in amount.   (c) The
Company and each of its subsidiaries have timely filed all material reports,
registrations and statements, together with any amendments required to be
made with respect thereto, that they were required to file since December 31,
1998 with any U.S., state or foreign regulatory authorities or self-
regulatory organization (each, a "REGULATORY AGENCY"), and have paid
all material fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith.
Except for normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the
regular course of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, no
Regulatory Agency has initiated any proceeding or investigation or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened any investigation into the business or
operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries since December 31, 1998,
except for such proceedings or investigations which would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
Effect.   Section 3.08 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as
set forth in the Company SEC Documents, since June 30, 2001, the Company
has conducted its business in the ordinary course and consistent with past
practice and there has not occurred: (i) any changes, effects or
circumstances, including any damage to, destruction or loss of any asset of
the Company (whether or not covered by insurance) which have had, or are
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect; (ii) any amendments or changes in the Company Charter
Documents; (iii) any material change by the Company in its accounting

in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice, any
sale of a material amount of assets of the Company.   Section 3.09 No
Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents,
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities
(absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise), except liabilities (i) in the
aggregate adequately provided for in the Company\'s unaudited balance sheet
(including any related notes thereto) as of March 31, 2001, included in the

2001 (the "2001 BALANCE SHEET"), (ii) incurred since March 31, 2001 in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice, (iii) incurred
in connection with this Agreement or the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby or (iv) which would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
Effect.   Section 3.10 Absence of Litigation. Except as set forth in
the Company SEC Documents or arising out of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, there are no claims, actions, suits, arbitrations,
proceedings or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any properties
or rights of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, before any court,
arbitrator or Governmental Authority, that would reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.  
Section 3.11 Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA.   (a) The Company Disclosure

benefit plan, arrangement or agreement including without limitation any
employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of the

the current or former employees, officers or directors of the Company and its
subsidiaries employed in the United States. The term "FOREIGN PLAN" shall
refer to each material plan that is subject to or governed by the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States and which would have been
treated as a Company Employee Plan had it been a plan governed by the laws of
and maintained primarily for the benefit of persons performing service in the
United States. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make
available to Parent a list and copies of the Foreign Plans, within fifteen
(15) business days following the date of this Agreement, but in no event

to Parent true and complete copies of each of the Company Employee Plans and
certain related documents, including, but not limited to each writing
constituting a part of such Company Employee Plan, including all amendments
thereto, and will provide to Parent as promptly as practicable following the

accompanying schedules, if any; and (ii) the most recent determination letter
from the IRS (if applicable) for such Company Employee Plan.     
-15-       (c) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually
or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) each of the
Company Employee Plans has been operated and administered in all material
respects with applicable laws, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code
and in each case the regulations thereunder; (ii) each of the Company
Employee Plans intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service that such Company Employee Plan is so qualified,
and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no existing circumstances or
any events that have occurred that could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the qualified status of any such plan or cause the Company to be
subject to excise taxes or liability; (iii) no Company Employee Plan provides
benefits, including, without limitation, death or medical benefits (whether
or not insured), with respect to current or former employees or directors of
the Company or its subsidiaries beyond their retirement or other termination
of service, other than (A) coverage mandated by applicable law or (B) death
benefits or retirement benefits under any "employee pension plan" (as such
term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA); (iv) with respect to each Company
Employee Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section
412 or 4971 of the Code, (A) there does not now exist any accumulated funding
deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA, whether or not waived, (B) no reportable event within the meaning of

waived has occurred, (C) all premiums to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") have been timely paid in full, (D) no
liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has
been or is reasonably expected to be incurred by the Company or its
subsidiaries, (E) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any
such Company Employee Plan, and (F) the present value of the accrued benefits
under such Company Employee Plan, based upon the most recent actuarial report
prepared by the Company Employee Plan\'s actuary for such Company Employee
Plan, did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such Company
Employee Plan allocable to such accrued benefits; (v) no Company Employee
Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan" (as such term is defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA) or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least
two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063
of ERISA; (vi) all contributions or other amounts payable by the Company or
its subsidiaries with respect to each Company Employee Plan in respect of
current or prior plan years have been paid or accrued in accordance with
GAAP; (vii) neither the Company nor its subsidiaries has engaged in
a transaction in connection with which the Company or its subsidiaries
reasonably could be subject to either a material civil penalty assessed
pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a material tax imposed pursuant
to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code; and (viii) there are no pending,
threatened or anticipated claims (other than routine claims for benefits) by,
on behalf of or against any of the Company Employee Plans or any trusts
related thereto that could reasonably be expected to result in a material
liability of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.   (d) Neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) will (i)
result in any material payment (including, without limitation, severance,
unemployment compensation, "excess parachute payment" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code), forgiveness of indebtedness or otherwise) becoming
due to any director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries from
the Company or any of its subsidiaries under any Company Employee Plan or
otherwise, (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable     
-16-      under any Company Employee Plan or (iii) result in any
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any benefits under any
Company Employee Plan.   With respect to each Foreign Plan, except as would
not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect:   (i) all employer and employee contributions to
each Foreign Plan required by law or by the terms of such Foreign Plan have
been made, or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with normal accounting
practices;   (ii) the fair market value of the assets of each
funded Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Plan
funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign
Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or
provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the Closing Date, with
respect to all current or former participants in such plan according to the
actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to such Foreign Plan; and   (iii) each Foreign Plan required
by applicable law to be registered has been registered and has been
maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities.  
Section 3.12 Labor Matters.   (a) Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries is a party to any U.S. or non-U.S. collective bargaining
agreement or other labor union contract applicable to persons employed by the
Company or its subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, are there
any activities or proceedings of any labor union to organize any employees of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries.   (b) Neither the Company nor any
of its subsidiaries is in breach of any U.S. or non-U.S. collective
bargaining agreement or labor union contract, or has any knowledge of any

respect to any employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

accuracy of the representations of Parent in Section 4.04:   (a) Neither the
Schedule 14D-9 nor any of the information supplied by the Company for
inclusion in the Offer Documents will, at the times the Schedule 14D-9, the
Offer Documents or any amendments or supplements thereto are filed with the
SEC or are first published, sent or given to stockholders of the Company, as
the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.   (b) In the event a Stockholders\' Meeting
(as hereinafter defined) is held, neither the proxy statement to be sent to
the stockholders of the Company in connection with such Stockholders\'
Meeting or the information statement to be sent to such stockholders, as
appropriate (such proxy statement or information statement, as amended or
supplemented, being      -17-      referred to herein as the "PROXY
STATEMENT"), shall, at the date the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) is first mailed to stockholders of the Company or at the
time of the Stockholders\' Meeting, contain any statement which, at the time
and in light of the circumstances under which it was made, is false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or which omits to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or
misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication
with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Stockholders\' Meeting
which shall have become false or misleading.   (c) Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to
any information supplied by Parent, Purchaser or any of Parent\'s or
Purchaser\'s representatives for inclusion in the foregoing documents.  
(d) The Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement, if applicable, shall comply
in all material respects as to form with the requirements of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder.   Section 3.14 Restrictions on
Business Activities; Agreement with Regulatory Agencies.   (a) Except for
this Agreement or as set forth in the Company SEC Documents, there is no
agreement, judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon the Company or

from performing or cause the Company not to perform its covenants hereunder
in any material respect, cause any condition to the Company\'s obligations to
consummate the Transactions set forth in Article VII not to be satisfied or
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Offer and the Merger .  
Section 5.02 No Solicitation.   (a) The Company shall not, directly or
indirectly through any officer, director, employee, representative or agent
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (including any investment banker,
attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its subsidiaries), (i)
solicit or encourage the initiation of (including by way of furnishing
information) any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, sale of assets,
sale of shares of capital stock (including, without     
-29-      limitation, by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions
involving the Company or any subsidiaries of the Company that if consummated
would constitute an Alternative Transaction (as defined below) (any of the
foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to herein as an "ACQUISITION
PROPOSAL") or (ii) have any discussion with or provide any confidential
information or data to any third party that would encourage, facilitate or
further an Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an
Acquisition Proposal, or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make
or implement an Acquisition Proposal; provided, that the Company may furnish
information (but only to the extent that such information was previously
provided to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement or is provided to
Parent concurrently therewith) to, or enter into discussions or negotiations
with, any person that has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal if, and only to the extent that (A) the Company Board, after
consulting with and having considered the advice of independent legal
counsel, determines in good faith that (x) such Acquisition Proposal would,
if consummated, be reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal (as
hereinafter defined), and (y) failing to take such action would constitute a
breach of the fiduciary obligations of the Board under applicable law and (B)
prior to taking such action, the Company (x) provides reasonable notice to
Parent (no later than 24 hours prior to taking such action) to the effect
that it is taking such action and (y) receives from such person an executed
confidentiality/standstill agreement in reasonably customary form and in any
event containing terms at least as restrictive to such person as
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement between Parent and the
Company.   For purposes of this Agreement, "ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTION" means
any of (x) a transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons)
other than Parent or its affiliates (a "THIRD PARTY") acquires or would
acquire more than 10% of the outstanding shares of any class of equity
securities of the Company, whether from the Company or pursuant to a tender
offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (y) any transaction pursuant to which
any Third Party acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for
this purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of the Company
and securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination
including any of the Company\'s subsidiaries) of the Company, or any of its
subsidiaries having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of
Directors of the Company in good faith) equal to more than 10% of the fair
market value of all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, or (z) any other merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction
involving the Company or any significant subsidiary of the Company, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that,
following termination of this Agreement, the term "Alternative Transaction"
shall not include any acquisition of securities by a broker-dealer in
connection with a bona fide public offering of such securities.   (b) The
Company shall notify Parent orally and in writing promptly (but in no event
later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, and any
modification of or amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, and any request for
non-public information relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties,
books or records of the Company or any subsidiary by any person or entity
that informs the Board of Directors of the Company or such subsidiary that it
is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to
Parent shall indicate the identity of the person making the
Acquisition Proposal or intending to make an Acquisition Proposal or
requesting non-public information or access to the books and records of the
Company, the      -30-      material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal or modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal and copies
of any written Acquisition Proposals or amendments or supplements thereto.
The Company shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of any material
changes in the status and any material changes or modifications in the
material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request.  
(c) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than
Parent) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. The
Company agrees not to release any third party from the confidentiality and
standstill provisions of any agreement to which the Company is a party, other
than agreements with the Company\'s customers and suppliers entered into in
the ordinary course of business.   (d) Nothing contained in this Section
5.02 shall prohibit the Company or the Board from taking and disclosing to
its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders
if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company,
after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with applicable law.   (e) Except as set forth in Section
5.02(a) (with respect to the confidentiality/standstill agreement referenced
therein) and this Section 5.02(e), the Board will not approve or recommend or
permit the Company to enter into any agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal made by any person other than Parent. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Board, after consultation with independent legal
counsel, determines in good faith that failing to take such action would
constitute a breach of the fiduciary obligations of the Board under
applicable law, the Board may approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal
(or amendment or supplement thereto) or cause the Company to enter into an
agreement with respect thereto, but in each case only if (i) the Company
provides written notice to Parent (a "NOTICE OF SUPERIOR PROPOSAL"), which
notice must be received by Parent at least three business days (exclusive of
the day of receipt by Parent of the Notice of Superior Proposal) prior to the
time it intends to cause the Company to enter into such an agreement,
advising Parent in writing that the Board has received an
Acquisition Proposal (or amendment or supplement thereto) which it believes
constitutes a Superior Proposal and which it intends to accept and, with
respect to which, enter into a definitive agreement, subject to the
provisions of this Section 5.02(e), providing a copy of any written offer or
proposal describing the Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such
Superior Proposal, (ii) as of the end of such three business day period
referenced above, Parent shall have failed to notify the Company in writing
that it has determined to revise the terms of the Offer and the Merger to
provide that the Per Share Amount and Merger Consideration will be equal to
or greater than the consideration to be paid to the Company stockholders
pursuant to the Superior Proposal, and (iii) the Company terminates this
Agreement in accordance with the requirements of Section 8.01(f) within 48
hours after the lapse of the three-day period referenced above and
immediately thereafter enters into an agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means any
bona fide Acquisition Proposal to acquire 100% of the outstanding common
stock of the Company not subject to a financing condition and not directly or
indirectly initiated,      -31-      solicited, encouraged or
knowingly facilitated by the Company after the date of this Agreement in
violation hereof which the Board determines in its good faith judgment (based
on the advice of an investment banker of nationally recognized reputation),
taking into account all relevant legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal, (i) would result
in an Alternative Transaction that is more favorable to the
Company\'s stockholders (in their capacity as stockholders), from a financial
point of view, than the Transactions and (ii) is reasonably likely to be
completed.   Section 5.03 Covenants of Parent. During the period from the
date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement or the Effective Time, Parent covenants and agrees that,
unless the Company shall otherwise agree in writing, Parent shall not, and
shall cause Purchaser not to, take, or agree in writing or otherwise to take,
any action intended to or that would reasonably be expected to make any of
the representations or warranties of Parent contained in this Agreement
materially untrue or materially incorrect, prevent Parent or Purchaser from
performing or cause Parent or Purchaser not to perform their covenants
hereunder in any material respect, cause any condition to Parent\'s or
Purchaser\'s obligations to consummate the Transactions set forth in Article
VII not to be satisfied or prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Offer and the Merger.   ARTICLE VI   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 
---------------------   Section 6.01 Stockholders\' Meeting.   (a) If
required by applicable law in order to consummate the Merger, the Company,
acting through the Board, shall, in accordance with applicable law and the
Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, (i) duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of its
stockholders as promptly as practicable following consummation of the Offer
for the purpose of considering and taking action on this Agreement and the
Merger (the "STOCKHOLDERS\' MEETING"), use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain adoption of this Agreement by the Company\'s stockholders. At the
Stockholders\' Meeting, Parent and Purchaser shall cause all Shares then
owned by them and their subsidiaries to be voted in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement.   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
Purchaser shall acquire shares of Class A Common Stock representing at least
90% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the Class A Common
Stock (giving effect to Purchaser\'s obligation to convert all such shares
accepted for purchase in the Offer to shares of Class A Common Stock as
contemplated by Section 1.01(a)), pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, the
parties shall take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger
to become effective, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL, as promptly
as reasonably practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of the
stockholders of the Company.   Section 6.02 Proxy Statement. If approval of
the Company\'s stockholders is required by applicable law to consummate the
Merger, promptly following consummation of the Offer, the Company shall file
the Proxy Statement with the SEC under the Exchange Act, and     
-32-      shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy
Statement cleared by the SEC promptly. Each of the Company, Parent and
Purchaser agrees to use its reasonable best efforts, after consultation with
the other parties hereto, to respond promptly to all such comments of and
requests by the SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement and all required
amendments and supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of Shares
entitled to vote at the Stockholders\' Meeting at the earliest practicable
time; provided further, that, in the event there is a subsequent offering
period as contemplated by Section 1.01(a), the Company shall initiate the
actions contemplated hereby no later than the fifth business day after the
first day of the initial such subsequent offering period if Section 6.01(b)
has not theretofore become applicable.   Section 6.03 Board of Directors;
Section 14(f).   (a) Effective upon the purchase by Purchaser of Shares
pursuant to the Offer , a number of Purchaser\'s designees shall be elected
to the Board as set forth in this Section 6.03. Purchaser shall be entitled
to designate up to such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, on the Board as shall give Purchaser representation on the Board
equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Board (giving
effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the
percentage that the aggregate number of votes represented by Shares
beneficially owned by Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser following such
purchases bears to the total number of votes represented by Shares then
outstanding, and the Company shall, at such time, promptly take all actions
necessary to cause Purchaser\'s designees to be elected as directors of the
Company including securing the resignations of incumbent directors (except as
set forth in the last sentence of this subsection (a)). At such time, the
persons designated by Purchaser will, as nearly as practicable, constitute
the same percentage as persons designated by Purchaser shall constitute of
the Board of (i) each committee of the Board, (ii) each board of directors of
each Subsidiary, and (iii) each committee of each such board, in each case
only to the extent permitted by applicable law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, until the Effective Time, the Company shall use its best efforts
to ensure that (x) at least two members of the Board and each committee of
the Board and such boards and committees of the Subsidiaries, as of the date
hereof, who are not employees of the Company shall remain members of the
Board and of such boards and committees and (y) such number of members of the
Board shall be independent as required by the relevant rules of the New
York Stock Exchange, Inc.   (b) The Company shall promptly take all actions
required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder to fulfill its obligations under this Section 6.03,
and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the
Company and its officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1 to fulfill such obligations. Parent or Purchaser shall supply to
the Company, and be solely responsible for, any information with respect to
either of them and their nominees, officers, directors and affiliates
required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.   (c) Following the election
of designees of Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.03, prior to the
Effective Time, any amendment of this Agreement or the Certificate of
Incorporation or By-laws of the Company, any termination of this Agreement by
the Company, any extension by the Company of the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Purchaser, or waiver of any
of the Company\'s rights hereunder, shall require the     
-33-      concurrence of a majority of the directors of the Company then
in office who neither were designated by Purchaser nor are employees of the
Company or any subsidiary of the Company.   Section 6.04 Access to
Information; Confidentiality. Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall,
during the period after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
prior to the Effective Time, (i) afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, investment bankers and other representatives of Parent

reasonably available, during normal business hours, to Parent the appropriate
officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries for discussion of
the Company\'s business, properties, prospects, assets, liabilities,
financial statements, ratings, regulatory compliance, risk management, books,
records, contracts, agreements, commitments and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request, provided that any discussions of employment prospects or
retention with Company employees shall be undertaken only in coordination and
after consultation with senior management of the Company. Such information
shall be kept confidential in accordance with the terms of the
confidentiality agreement, dated July 19, 2001 (the "CONFIDENTIALITY
AGREEMENT"), between Parent and the Company.   Section 6.05 Reasonable Best
Efforts; Consents; Approvals.   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each party hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, in good faith, all actions, and do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and

using its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required Approvals, and (iii)
to the extent reasonably practicable and consistent with applicable law,
agreeing to place in a trust or otherwise hold separate any non-material

of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to
make or cause to be made (i) prior to August 10, 2001, an appropriate filing
of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) as promptly as practicable,
appropriate filings with the European Commission and any other applicable
Governmental Authorities, if required, in accordance with
applicable competition, merger control, antitrust, investment or similar
laws, and (iii) as promptly as practicable, all other     
-34-      necessary filings with other Governmental Authorities relating
to the Merger, and, to supply as promptly as practicable any additional

by such authorities and to use reasonable best efforts to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
and the receipt of Required Approvals under such other laws or from such
authorities as soon as practicable.   (b) Each of Parent and the Company
shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 6.05(a) to obtain
all Required Approvals, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in
all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and
in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) subject to applicable law,
permit the other party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed written or

and any Governmental Authority, (iii) promptly inform each other of and
supply to such other party any communication (or other correspondence or

communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iv) consult with each other in advance of any meeting or
conference with the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Authority or,
in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person,
and to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or such other applicable
Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences. For purposes of
Section 6.05(a) and this Section 6.05(b), the term "COMPANY" shall be deemed
to refer to the Company and the Principal Stockholder.   (c) In furtherance
and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in Sections
6.05(a) and 6.05(b), if any objections are asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby under any antitrust or competition law,
Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any antitrust
concerns, federal, state, foreign or private, obtain all Required Approvals
and obtain termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or any other
applicable law and the termination of any outstanding judicial or
administrative orders prohibiting the Closing so as to permit consummation of
the Offer as soon as practicable. In furtherance and not in limitation
thereof, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including
any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of any law or regulation, or if any statute, rule,
regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or administrative order is
enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by a Governmental Authority that
would make the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby illegal or would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby, the Company shall cooperate with Parent in all respects in responding
thereto, and each shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to
contest, resist and/or attempt to resolve any such action or proceeding and
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to have
such statute,      -35-      rule, regulation, executive order,
decree, injunction or administrative order repealed, rescinded or made
inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the Transactions.   (d) The
parties acknowledge and agree that Parent\'s "reasonable best efforts" as it
is referenced in this Section 6.05 shall not require Parent to take or agree
to take or agree to the Company taking any actions with respect to the assets
or businesses of the Company and its subsidiaries and/or the assets or
businesses of Parent and its subsidiaries if any action or all of
such actions taken together have, or would reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company (or the Surviving Corporation) and
its subsidiaries. For purposes of this subsection (d), the determination of
the effect of any actions taken by Parent with respect to its assets or
businesses shall be measured based upon the effect on the Company (or the
Surviving Corporation) and its subsidiaries if such actions were taken with
respect to a comparable amount or value of assets or businesses of the
Company.   (e) The Company and Parent shall notify the other promptly upon
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials in connection with any filing made pursuant hereto and
of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for
amendments or supplements to the Offer Documents, the Proxy Statement or any
other filings or for additional information and will supply the other with
copies of all correspondence between such party or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other
government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Offer Documents,
the Proxy Statement, the Merger or any other filing. The Company shall, and
Parent shall and shall cause Purchaser to, cause all documents that it is
responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory authorities under
Article I, Section 6.01 and this Section 6.05 to comply in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of law and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. Whenever any event occurs which
is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer
Documents or Proxy Statement or any other filing, the Company will, or Parent
will cause Parent to, as the case may be, promptly inform the other of such
occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials and/or mailing to stockholders of the Company, such
amendment or supplement.   Section 6.06 Indemnification and Insurance.  
(a) The Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification set forth in the
Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, modified or
otherwise repealed for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder as of the Effective
Time of individuals who at the Effective Time were directors or officers of
the Company, unless such modification is required after the Effective Time by
law and then only to the minimum extent required by such law.   (b)
Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless each
present and former director or officer of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries (collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against any costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal,      -36-      administrative or investigative,
(x) arising out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (y) otherwise with respect to any acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, in each case to the same extent as provided
in the Company Charter Documents or any applicable contract or agreement as
in effect on the date hereof. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), (i) any counsel retained by the Indemnified Parties for any period
after the Effective Time shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation, (ii) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, promptly
after statements therefor are received, provided that the Indemnified Parties
shall be required to reimburse the Surviving Corporation for such payments,
but only in the circumstances and to the extent required by the Company
Charter Documents, any applicable contract or agreement with such Indemnified
Party or applicable law, and (iii) the Surviving Corporation will cooperate
in the defense of any such matter; provided, however, that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). The
Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to represent them
in each applicable jurisdiction with respect to any single action unless
there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict
between the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties, in which case
each Indemnified Person with respect to whom such a conflict exists (or group
of such Indemnified Persons who among them have no such conflict) may retain
one separate law firm in each applicable jurisdiction.   (c) The Surviving
Corporation shall honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the
Company pursuant to indemnification agreements and employment agreements (the
parties under such agreements being referred to as the "COVERED PERSONS")
with the Company\'s directors and officers existing at or before the
Effective Time, provided such agreements do not violate Section 5.01(f).  
(d) In addition, Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, for a period of not less than four years after the Effective Time,
the Company\'s current directors and officers (as defined to mean those
persons insured under such policy) with an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO; INSURANCE") that is no less favorable
than the existing policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage
is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium
for the DandO; Insurance in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid
by the Company for such insurance, but in such case shall purchase as much of
such coverage as possible for such amount.   (e) This Section shall survive
the consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time, is intended to benefit
the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Indemnified Parties and the
Covered Persons, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and
the Covered Persons.   Section 6.07 Notification of Certain Matters. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event
the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would reasonably be     
-37-      expected to cause any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement to be materially untrue or inaccurate, or (ii) any failure of
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, materially to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available

to the other party.   Section 6.08 Public Announcements. Parent and the
Company shall consult with each other and the Principal Stockholder before
issuing any press release or making any written public statement with respect

release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the
other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however,

press release or make such public statement as may upon the advice of counsel
be required by law or the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
(including, without limitation, Rules 165 and 425 under the Securities Act
and Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act) or the NYSE if it has used all
reasonable efforts to consult with the other party.   Section 6.09 Stock
Options and Company Stock Awards.   (a) At the Effective Time, all Company
Stock Options shall be fully vested and each holder of a Company Stock Option

payment in an amount in respect thereof equal to the product of (i) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price of such
Company Stock Option and (ii) the number of Shares subject to the Company
Stock Option, less any income or employment or other Tax withholding required

Award shall be paid in full satisfaction of such Company Stock Award a cash

plan and to provide that the converted value of the Company stock fund
account may be merged into the participant\'s other investment fund
accounts under the Company\'s Executive Deferred     
-38-      Compensation Plan and treated in accordance with the terms of
such plan applicable to other investment fund accounts.   (d) The Company
shall take such action as is necessary to end the then current offering
period under the Company\'s 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan prior to the
Effective Time, and to terminate such plan as of the Effective Time, and
otherwise to implement all of the provisions of this Section 6.09.   Section
6.10 Certain Employee Benefits.   (a) From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to the individuals who
are employees of the Company and its subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
(the "COMPANY EMPLOYEES") compensation and employee benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those in effect for substantially similar
employees of Parent and its affiliates. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, each Company Employee whose employment is terminated
(other than for "Proper Cause" as defined in the Company\'s Severance Pay
Plan, as amended, as in effect on the date hereof (the "SEVERANCE PAY PLAN"))
during the eighteen-month period following the Effective Time shall be
entitled to receive severance pay in an amount not less than the amount
provided under the Severance Pay Plan as in effect on the date hereof and
with rights and pursuant to terms and conditions that are no less favorable
than the employee\'s rights under, and the terms and conditions of, the
Severance Pay Plan, as amended, including Exhibit A thereto.   (b) For
purposes of all employee benefit and compensation plans, programs and
arrangements maintained or contributed to by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, in which the Company Employees shall be eligible to participate,
Parent shall cause each such plan, program or arrangement to treat the prior
service of each Company Employee with the Company or its affiliates
as service rendered to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for purposes
of eligibility, vesting and benefit entitlements (for severance, vacation and
other service-based benefits but not for purposes of benefit accruals under
any defined benefit pension plan). From and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility
waiting periods under any welfare benefit plans of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to be waived with respect to the Company Employees and their
eligible dependents and (ii) give each Company Employee credit for the plan
year in which the Effective Time (or the transition from the Company Employee
Plans to Parent\'s or the Surviving Corporation\'s plans) occurs towards
applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred
prior to the Effective Time (or such other transition date).   (c) From and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, or cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor, all benefit obligations to and contractual rights of
current and former employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, including
the arrangements set forth on Section 6.10(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. Parent shall take all actions necessary to satisfy, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to satisfy, the obligations
listed in Section 6.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.   Section 6.11
Keep Well Agreement. Simultaneously herewith, Parent, the Stockholder

respect to all rights, liabilities and obligations of the Stockholder
Entities under the Keep Well Agreement, and Parent agrees that such letter
agreement shall remain in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of
(i) the termination of this Agreement or (ii) the termination of the Keep
Well Agreement, in each case in accordance with their respective terms.

affiliate of either of them illegal or otherwise restricting, preventing or
prohibiting consummation of the Transactions; and   (c) Purchase of Shares.
Purchaser shall have accepted for payment and paid for Shares pursuant to the
Offer; provided, however, that this condition shall be deemed to be satisfied

the Company if any Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued,
promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction, order, decree or
ruling      -40-      (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)
which has become final and nonappealable and has the effect of making
consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal or otherwise preventing or
prohibiting consummation of the Offer or the Merger; provided that the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement shall have used its reasonable best
efforts to remove or lift such injunction, order, decree or ruling; or  
(c) By either Parent or the Company (provided that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a material
breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations
or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the other party such
that the conditions set forth in subclauses (a)-(c) of clause (v) of Annex A
would not be satisfied, which breach is not cured within 15 days following
written notice to the breaching party, or which breach, by its nature or
timing, cannot be cured prior to the consummation of the Offer; or   (d) By
the Company if Parent or Purchaser fails to commence the Offer as provided in
Section 1.01(a) hereof; or   (e) By Parent or the Company if (i) the Offer

determination by the Company\'s Board of Directors to terminate this

respects the procedures required by Section 5.02(e), and (iii) immediately
prior to such termination the Company shall have made payment of the full
amounts required by Section 8.03(b) and immediately after such termination
the Company shall have entered into a definitive acquisition, merger or
similar agreement to effect such Acquisition Proposal; or   (g) By Parent
prior to the purchase of any Shares in the Offer if (i) the Board shall have
(A) withdrawn or modified in a manner materially adverse to Parent the
recommendation of such Board of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger, (B)
approved or recommended an Acquisition Proposal made by any person other than
Parent or Purchaser, or (C) materially breached the provisions of Section
5.02, or (ii) the Principal Stockholder shall have materially breached the

misrepresentation herein.   Section 8.03 Fees and Expenses.   (a) Except
as otherwise specifically provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in

Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(g) and (B) within 12 months after such
termination, the Company or any of its subsidiaries enters into any
definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Alternative
Transaction, or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.01(f), then the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $200
million (the "TERMINATION FEE") by wire transfer of same day funds to an
account designated by Parent (x) in the case of a payment as a result of any
event referred to in Section 8.03(b)(i), upon the first to occur of entering

and (y) in the case of a payment as a result of any event referred to in
Section 8.03(b)(ii), promptly, but in no event later than the date of such
termination and as a condition to the effectiveness of such termination. For
purposes of Sections 8.03(b)(i), an Alternative Transaction shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.02(a), except that the references
to "10%" in such definition shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

the expiration of the Offer issued a decision pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) or
Article 8(2) of the EC Merger Regulation declaring the transactions
contemplated in the Offer compatible with the Common Market and (b) in the

contemplated in the Offer in terms satisfactory to Parent; (iii) any approval
or consent of any Governmental Authority, including without limitation, any
Regulatory Approval, which is necessary for the Transactions to be
consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, or any relevant
statutory, regulatory or other governmental waiting periods, whether
domestic, foreign or supranational, the failure of which to be obtained or to
be in full force and effect, and any waiting period the failure of which to
have expired, would, upon the purchase of the Shares pursuant to the
Offer, either (A) individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company or the Surviving Corporation or (B) result in any
violation of law, shall not have been obtained or be in full force and effect
or shall not have expired; (iv) there shall not have been validly tendered

following conditions shall exist:   (a) any Material Adverse Effect on the
Company shall have occurred;   (b) the representations and warranties of
the Company in the Agreement, other than in Section 3.03(a), shall not be
true and correct, except where the failure of such representations or
warranties to be true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as

have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or the representation and
warranties of the Company in Section 3.03(a) of the Agreement shall not be
true and correct in all material respects;       (c) the Company shall
have failed to perform, in all material respects, its material obligations or

effect of making the acquisition of Shares by Parent or Purchaser or any
affiliate of either of them illegal or otherwise restricting, preventing or
prohibiting consummation of the Transactions.  The foregoing conditions,
other than the Minimum Condition, are for the sole benefit of Purchaser and
may be asserted by Purchaser regardless of the circumstances giving rise to
any such condition or may be waived by Purchaser in whole or in part at any
time and from time to time in its sole discretion. The failure by Purchaser
at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a
waiver of any such right; the waiver of any such right with respect to
particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with
respect to any other facts and circumstances; and each such right shall
be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.             -ii-      '
