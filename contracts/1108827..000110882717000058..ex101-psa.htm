(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Asset Taxes that were withheld or
deducted from the gross amount paid or payable to such Seller in connection
with a transaction to which Section 3.3(b)(i) applies, and therefore were
taken into account in determining the "proceeds received" by such Seller for
purposes of applying Section 3.3(b)(i) with respect to such transaction);

(iv)to the extent that such Seller's interest in any of the Wells is
underproduced with respect to any Hydrocarbons as of the Effective Time, in

gaseous Hydrocarbons, an amount equal to the product of (1) the underproduced
volumes set forth on Schedule 9.12(a), multiplied by (2) $3.00/MMBtu; and (B)

such Seller's interest pursuant to an applicable joint operating agreement or

including the Effective Time and the Closing Date, with such amount prorated
to the extent of any partial months;

(vi)an amount equal to all payout balances existing as of the Effective Time
for "non-consent" interests for which such Seller is entitled to receive
revenue from the production of a Well allocable to such non-consent interest
until all recoverable costs are recouped from such Well, a schedule of such
balances as of March 1, 2017 is set forth on Schedule 9.12(b); and

respective Affiliates that are attributable to such Seller's ownership or
operation of the Assets from and after the Effective Time up to Closing,
including the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from such Seller's interest in the
Assets or allocable thereto, net of any sales, excise or similar Taxes in
connection therewith not reimbursed to such Seller or its respective
Affiliates, as applicable, by a Third Party;

(iii)subject to Section 13.2(i), if Buyer makes the election under (A) Section

any uncured Title Defect, the Allocated Value attributable to the assets
excluded from the transactions contemplated hereby with respect to such Title
Defect;

(iv)the Allocated Value of any Assets excluded from the Closing or the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to Section 12.1(c), Section 13.2(c),
Section 13.2(k), Section 13.4, Section 14.1(b) or Section 14.1(f);

(v)the amount of any adjustments pursuant to Section 13.3;

(vi)the amount of all Asset Taxes prorated to such Seller in accordance with
Section 15.2(b) but paid or economically borne by Buyer;

(vii)to the extent that such Seller's interest in any of the Wells is
overproduced with respect to any Hydrocarbons as of the Effective Time, in
each case, as set forth on Schedule 9.12(a), the sum of: (A) with respect to
gaseous Hydrocarbons, an amount equal to the product of (1) the overproduced
volumes set forth on Schedule 9.12(a), multiplied by (2) $3.00/MMBtu; and (B)
with respect to liquid Hydrocarbons, an amount equal to the product of (1) the
overproduced volumes set forth on such Seller's Schedule 9.12(a), multiplied
by (2) $50.00/Bbl;

(viii)the amount of any adjustments pursuant to Section 11.9; and

(ix)any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise

among Sellers, adjustments to the Purchase Price shall be applied against or
credited to, as the case may be, the affected individual Seller's interests as
determined by Seller's Representative in its sole but reasonable good faith
discretion in accordance with this Agreement. Except as specifically provided
in Section 3.7, Buyer shall have no obligation to allocate the Purchase Price
(including any adjustments thereto) among the Sellers.

3.4 Preliminary Settlement Statement. Not less than five Business Days prior
to the Closing, Seller's Representative shall prepare and submit to Buyer for
review a draft settlement statement (the "Preliminary Settlement Statement")
that shall set forth the Adjusted Purchase Price, reflecting each adjustment
made in accordance with this Agreement as of the date of preparation of such
Preliminary Settlement Statement and the itemized calculation and reasonable
supporting documentation of the adjustments used to determine such amount,
together with the designation of Seller's Representative's accounts for the
wire transfers of funds and other applicable information set forth in Section
2.4. The Preliminary Settlement Statement shall also set forth the Seller's
Representative's good faith allocation of the portion of the Adjusted Purchase
Price payable at the Closing among Sellers, and shall provide wiring
instructions for the Seller's Representative. Within three Business Days of
receipt of the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Buyer will deliver to
Seller's 

Representative a written report containing all changes (including the
explanations therefor) that Buyer proposes to be made to the Preliminary
Settlement Statement, which report, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not
challenge or address any allocation of the Adjusted Purchase Price among the
Sellers that was proposed by the Seller's Representative. The Preliminary
Settlement Statement, as agreed upon by the Parties, will be used to set the
Adjusted Purchase Price at Closing; provided that if Buyer and Seller's
Representative do not agree upon an adjustment set forth in the Preliminary
Settlement Statement, then the amount of such adjustment used to adjust the
Adjusted Purchase Price at Closing shall be the amount proposed by Seller's
Representative in the Preliminary Settlement Statement originally delivered by
the Seller's Representative to Buyer pursuant to this Section 3.4.

3.5 Final Settlement Statement.

(a)On or before 120 days after the Closing, a final settlement statement (the
"Final Settlement Statement") will be prepared by Seller's Representative
based on actual income and expenses during the period from and after the
Effective Time until Closing and which takes into account all final
adjustments made to the Purchase Price and shows the resulting final Adjusted
Purchase Price. Buyer shall cooperate with Seller's Representative and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly furnish to Seller's Representative
all information in Buyer's possession relevant to preparation of the Final
Settlement Statement upon written request. The Final Settlement Statement
shall set forth the actual proration of amounts as may be required by this
Agreement. The Final Settlement Statement shall also set forth the Seller's
Representative's allocation of the Final Adjusted Amount among Sellers, and,
if needed, shall provide wiring instructions for the Seller's Representative.
As soon as practicable, and in any event within 45 days after receipt of the
Final Settlement Statement, Buyer shall return to Seller's Representative a
written report containing any proposed changes to the Final Settlement
Statement and an explanation of any such changes and the reasons therefor (the
"Dispute Notice"), which Dispute Notice, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not
challenge or address any allocation of the Adjusted Purchase Price among the
Sellers that was proposed by the Seller's Representative. Buyer's failure to
deliver to Seller's Representative a Dispute Notice detailing proposed changes
to the Final Settlement Statement by such date shall be deemed to be an
acceptance by Buyer of the Final Settlement Statement delivered by Seller's
Representative and any changes to the Final Settlement Statement as initially
prepared by Seller's Representative that are proposed or requested by Buyer
and not included in the Dispute Notice shall be deemed waived, and Seller's
Representative's determinations with respect to all such adjustments in the
Final Settlement Statement that are not addressed in the Dispute Notice shall
prevail. Upon delivery of a Dispute Notice, Buyer and the Seller's
Representative will promptly meet to discuss the contents thereof and attempt
to come to agreement upon the disputed items contained therein (other than any
allocation of the Adjusted Purchase Price among the Sellers, which allocation
shall be the sole purview of the Seller's Representative). If the final
Adjusted Purchase Price set forth in the Final Settlement Statement is
mutually agreed upon by Seller's Representative and Buyer or deemed agreed
pursuant to the foregoing (or determined by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant
to Section 3.6), the Final Settlement Statement (except, for the avoidance of
doubt, as it relates to any adjustments for Asset Taxes), such final Adjusted
Purchase Price as agreed by the Seller's Representative and the Buyer (or as
determined by the Accounting Arbitrator) and such allocation among Sellers (as
agreed by the Seller's Representative) (collectively, the "Final Price"),
shall be final and binding on the Parties. 

(b)Any difference in the Adjusted Purchase Price as paid at Closing pursuant
to the Preliminary Settlement Statement and the Final Price (such amount, the
"Final Adjustment Amount") shall be paid as follows:

(i)If the Final Adjustment Amount is owed by Buyer to Sellers, then, on or
before the date that is 10 days following agreement or deemed agreement (or
determination by the Accounting Arbitrator, as applicable) (such date, the
"Final Payment Date"), the Buyer shall pay the applicable amount to the
Seller's Representative, in accordance with the applicable allocation agreed
to (or determined) as part of the Final Price. For the avoidance of doubt, all
amounts owing to Sellers from Buyer pursuant to this Section 3.5 shall be
payable to the Seller's Representative as payment agent for the Sellers, to
the accounts provided in writing by such Seller's Representative in the Final
Settlement Statement, which shall in turn be distributed by the Seller's
Representative to the Sellers as provided in Section 2.4.

(ii)If the Final Adjustment Amount is owed by Sellers to Buyer, then, on or
before the Final Payment Date, the Seller's Representative (for any such
Seller that is required to pay Buyer pursuant to this Section 3.5(b)(ii))
shall pay Buyer the Final Adjustment Amount.

(iii)In addition, on or before the Final Payment Date, each Seller shall
transfer to Buyer all Suspense Funds held by such Seller.

(iv)All amounts paid or transferred pursuant to this Section 3.5 shall be
delivered in United States currency by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account or accounts specified in writing by Buyer or the Seller's
Representative, as applicable.

3.6 Disputes. If Seller's Representative and Buyer are unable to resolve any
matters addressed in the Dispute Notice within 25 Business Days after the
delivery of such Dispute Notice, then any of Buyer or Seller's Representative
shall have the right to invoke the dispute resolution provisions of this
Section 3.6 with respect to such disputed matters by delivering written notice
to the Seller's Representative or Buyer, as applicable. Within 10 Business
Days after any such Person has invoked the provisions of this Section 3.6,
Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller's Representative, on the other hand, shall
summarize its position with regard to such dispute in a written document of 20
pages or less and submit such summaries to the Houston, Texas office of
Deloitte LLP or if Deloitte LLP refuses to serve, KPMG LLP, and if KPMG LLP
refuses to serve, such other Person as Buyer and the Seller's Representative
may mutually select (the "Accounting Arbitrator"), together with the Dispute
Notice, the Final Settlement Statement and any other documentation such Party
may desire to submit. Within 20 Business Days after receiving such Persons'
respective submissions, the Accounting Arbitrator shall render a decision
choosing either the Seller's Representative's position or Buyer's position
with respect to each matter addressed in any Dispute Notice, based on the
materials described above. Any decision rendered by the Accounting Arbitrator
pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and binding on Sellers and Buyer
and will be enforceable against any of the Parties in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The costs of such Accounting Arbitrators shall be borne one-half
by Buyer and one-half by the Seller's Representative. In the event that both
Deloitte LLP and KPMG LLP decline to serve as the Accounting Arbitrator and
Buyer and Seller's Representative are unable to mutually agree on the
replacement Accounting Arbitrator, then the Accounting Arbitrator shall be
selected by the appointing authority of the Dallas, Texas office of the
American Arbitration Association. 

3.7 Allocation of Purchase Price / Allocated Values. Buyer and each Seller
agree that the unadjusted Purchase Price shall be allocated among each Seller
and each Seller's interest in the Assets as set forth in Exhibits A-1 or A-2,
as applicable. The "Allocated Value" for (a) any Seller's interest in any
Asset equals the portion of the unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to such
Seller's interest in Exhibits A-1 or A‑2, as applicable, and (b) all Sellers'
interests in any Asset equals the aggregate portions of the unadjusted
Purchase Price allocated to such Asset in Exhibits A-1 or A-2, as applicable.
The Parties also agree that such Allocated Values shall be used in calculating
adjustments to the Purchase Price as provided herein. Buyer and Sellers also
agree (i) that the Allocated Values, as so adjusted, shall be used by Sellers
and Buyer as the basis for reporting asset values and other items for purposes
of this Section 3.7, and (ii) that neither they nor their Affiliates will take
positions inconsistent with such Allocated Values in notices to Governmental
Authorities, in notices to Preferential Purchase Right holders or in other
documents or notices relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

3.8 Allocation of Consideration for Tax Purposes. Sellers and Buyer agree that
the Purchase Price, as adjusted, and other amounts treated for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes as consideration for a sale transaction (to the extent
known at such time) (collectively, the "Allocable Amount") shall be allocated
among the various Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and, to the fullest extent allowed
by applicable Laws, in a manner consistent with the Allocated Values. The
initial draft of such allocations shall be prepared by Buyer and shall be
provided to the Seller's Representative no later than 60 days after Closing
for the Seller's Representative's review and approval, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld (as adjusted, the "Allocation Schedule"). The Allocation
Schedule shall be updated to reflect any adjustments to the Allocable Amount.
The allocation of the Allocable Amount shall be reflected on a completed
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement under Section
1060), which Form will be timely filed separately by Sellers and Buyer with
the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to the requirements of Section 1060(b)
of the Code. Sellers and Buyer agree not to take any position inconsistent
with the allocations set forth in the Allocation Schedule unless required by
applicable Law or with the consent of the other Parties; provided, however,
that neither Party shall be unreasonably impeded in its ability and discretion
to negotiate, compromise and/or settle any Tax audit, claim or similar
proceedings in connection with such allocation. The Parties further agree that
the allocations set forth on the Allocation Schedule will represent reasonable
estimates of the fair market values of the Assets described therein.

(e)by delivery of written notice from Seller's Representative to Buyer, or

breach of any provision of this Agreement.

7.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any
provision of Section 7.1, then, except as provided in this Article VII and
except for the provisions of Section 1.1, Section 1.2, Section 7.1, this

12.1(d), Section 12.2, Section 12.3 and Article XV (other than Sections
15.2(b), 15.2(c), 15.8 and 15.9), this Agreement shall forthwith become void

shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Sellers.

(b)If Buyer has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(c) or Section 7.1(f) because of (i) the Willful Breach by any Seller of
this Agreement, or (ii) the failure of any Seller to close the transactions

terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing) have been satisfied (or waived
by Seller's Representative), (B) Buyer is ready, willing and able to perform
its obligations under Section 6.3, and (C) such Seller nevertheless fails to
close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then, in either such
event of clauses (i) or (ii) above, Buyer shall have the right of specific
performance as against such 

Seller. In the event that (1) such Seller shall be legally unable to provide
specific performance, or (2) Buyer shall be unable to obtain such specific
performance, after using its commercially reasonable efforts to do so, then in
either such case Buyer may (x) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(c) or Section 7.1(f), and (y) be entitled to recover Buyer's actual
damages from such Seller that are attributable to such Seller's Willful Breach
of this Agreement or failure to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Upon such termination, Buyer shall also be entitled to receive a
return of the Deposit from Escrow Agent, free and clear of any claims thereon
by Sellers, and Seller's Representative and Buyer shall instruct Escrow Agent

obligation hereunder as a result of such termination, and Seller's
Representative and Buyer shall, within five Business Days of the date this

"Indemnifying Party" when used in connection with particular Liabilities shall
mean the Party or Parties having an obligation to indemnify another Party or
Parties with respect to such Liabilities pursuant to this Article VIII, or
Section 12.1(d), and the term "Indemnified Party" when used in connection with
particular Liabilities shall mean the Party or Parties having the right to be
indemnified with respect to such Liabilities by another Party or Parties
pursuant to Article VIII or Section 12.1(d).

specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the "Claim Notice"). In the
event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third
Party against the Indemnified Party (a "Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall
provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual
knowledge of the Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served
with respect to the Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Party
to give notice of a Claim as provided in this Section 8.7 shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and
Section 12.1(d) (as applicable) except to the extent (and then only to the
extent) such failure prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend
against the Claim. In the event that the claim for indemnification is based
upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or breached.

it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of
the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

(d)If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability to defend the Claim, it
shall have the right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and
expense, the Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such
defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement of the Claim.

fails to timely respond, or admits its liability but fails diligently to
prosecute or settle the Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to defend against the Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, with counsel of the Indemnified Party's choosing, subject to the right
of the Indemnifying Party to admit its liability to defend the Claim and
assume the defense of the Claim at any time prior to its settlement or final
determination. If the Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its liability
for a Claim defense, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party
of any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option,
on or before the 10th day following receipt of that notice (i) to admit in
writing its liability for the Claim defense, and (ii) if liability is so
admitted, to reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement.

(f)In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to
(i) cure the Liabilities complained of, (ii) admit its liability for such
Liability or (iii) dispute the claim for such Liabilities. If the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such 30 day period that it

proceedings pending, being contemplated by or, to Buyer's knowledge,
threatened in writing against Buyer.

10.6 Litigation. There is no suit, action or litigation by any Person by or

case) pending, or threatened in writing, against Buyer, that would affect the
ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or perform its obligations hereunder.

10.7 Financing. As of Closing, Buyer will have sufficient cash in immediately
available funds and available lines of credit with which to pay the Purchase
Price, consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and perform
its obligations under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents.

10.8 Regulatory. As of the Closing Date, Buyer or its designee operator shall
be qualified to own and assume operatorship of oil, gas and mineral leases in

the Closing Date, (a) hold all lease bonds and any other surety or similar

10.9 Independent Evaluation. Buyer is sophisticated in the evaluation,
purchase, ownership and operation of oil and gas properties and related
facilities. In making its decision to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer has relied on its own
independent investigation and evaluation of the Assets and the advice of its
own legal, Tax, economic, environmental, engineering, geological and
geophysical advisors and not on any comments, statements, projections or other

Sellers. Buyer acknowledges and affirms that on or prior to Closing, Buyer
will have completed its independent investigation, verification, analysis, and
evaluation of the Assets and made all such reviews and inspections of the
Assets as it has deemed necessary or appropriate to consummate the transaction
contemplated hereunder; provided, however, no such investigation,

modify, release or waive any of Sellers' obligations or Liabilities hereunder
or under any of the other Transaction Documents.

for brokers' or finders' fees relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement for which Sellers or Sellers' Affiliates shall have any
responsibility.

its own account and not with a view to a sale or distribution thereof in
violation of the Securities Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, any
applicable state blue sky Laws or any other applicable securities Laws.

such an agreement, under the AAPL 610 (1989 Revision) form Operating
Agreement), IT BEING RECOGNIZED THAT, UNDER SUCH AGREEMENTS AND SUCH FORM, THE
OPERATOR (SOLELY IN ITS CAPACITY AS OPERATOR) IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS OWN
NEGLIGENCE, AND HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OTHER THAN FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

(d)Buyer acknowledges Sellers own undivided interests in certain of the
properties comprising the Assets that it is not the operator thereof, and

(ii) consent to any written request for approval of any AFE or similar request
that Buyer reasonably considers to be economically appropriate or is necessary
to continue any Asset in force and effect beyond Closing and to which operator
has consented. In the event the Parties are unable to agree within 10 days
(unless a shorter time, not to be less than 48 hours, is reasonably required
by the circumstances and the applicable joint operating agreement and such
shorter time is specified in such Seller's request for consent) of Buyer's
receipt of any consent request as to whether or not such Seller should elect
to participate in such operation, Buyer's decision shall control.

11.2 Operation of Assets After the Closing.

(a)Except as provided for in the Transition Services Agreement, it is
expressly understood and agreed that Sellers shall not be obligated to
continue operating any of the operated Assets following the Closing and Buyer
assumes full responsibility for operating (or causing the operation of) all
such Assets following the Closing. Seller does not warrant or guarantee that
Buyer will become the operator of the operated Assets or any portion of the
Assets, as such matter will be controlled by the applicable joint operating
agreement(s).

(b)Each Seller, as applicable, shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) use
its reasonable efforts to support Buyer's succession of any Seller currently
serving as operator of the Operated Assets, including (i) seeking the written
undertakings of the other co-owners of such Assets to Buyer's succession as
operator to such Seller with respect to such Operated Assets, (ii) confirming
that such owners will vote for Buyer to succeed such Seller as operator of
such Operated Assets under operating agreements applicable thereto, and (iii)
taking any other action reasonably requested by Buyer with respect to the
transfer of operatorship with respect to such Operated Assets. Buyer will file
all appropriate forms and declarations or bonds with federal and state
agencies relative to its assumption of operatorship promptly following
Closing. For all Operated Assets, all applicable Sellers will execute and
deliver to Buyer, and Buyer will promptly file all documents necessary for
such applicable Sellers to resign as operator of such Assets and for Buyer or
an Affiliate thereof to succeed such Seller as operator of such Assets,
including appropriate change or transfer of operator forms to file with the
applicable Governmental Authority.

(c)From and after Closing, if any Seller holding an applicable Retained Burden
has a right of consent to the formation of any drilling, spacing or pooled
unit (or the formation of any other pooled unit incorporating the Lands) or
the drilling of any allocation well, in each case, with respect to the Assets,
such Seller agrees and acknowledges that it shall not unreasonably delay,
withhold or condition such consent.

11.3 Employee Matters.

(a)From the Closing Date through a date that is 60 days after the Closing
Date, Sellers shall (upon reasonable notice and with the right to have a
representative present) permit 

Buyer and its Affiliates, and their respective authorized representatives, to
consult with employees of any Seller, or its Affiliates, who devote a majority
of their time to the Assets concerning matters related to the Assets
("Employees"). Each Seller shall use reasonable efforts to make the Employees
available to Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective representatives, at
such Seller's place of business, for such consultation which shall be for a
reasonable period of time and shall not unduly interfere with such Employees'
obligations or Seller's business operations.

(b)Sellers have provided Buyer, or within ten days following the Execution
Date, Sellers shall provide to Buyer, a list of the Employees and to whom
Buyer or its Affiliate may make offers of employment, which offers shall be
for employment effective as of the Closing Date and on terms and conditions
established by Buyer or its Affiliate in its sole discretion. Each such offer
shall be made on or before 15 days prior to the Closing Date. No later than
the date that is 5 days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall notify Seller's
Representative as to each Employee who has accepted employment with Buyer or
its Affiliate and each Employee who has rejected Buyer's or its Affiliate's
offer of employment. Each Employee who accepts an offer contemplated by this
Section 11.3(b) and assumes employment with Buyer or its Affiliate on or after
the Closing is referred to as a "Transferred Employee." The date on which a
Transferred Employee assumes employment with Buyer or its Affiliate is
referred to as his or her "Hire Date."

(c)The provisions of this Section 11.3 are solely for the benefit of the
Parties hereto and nothing in this Section 11.3, express or implied, shall
confer upon any Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any
rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment
for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 11.3, express or
implied, shall be (i) deemed an amendment of any Employee Benefit Plan
providing benefits to any Employee, or (ii) construed to prevent Buyer or its
Affiliates from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any
employee benefit plan that Buyer or its Affiliates may establish or maintain.

11.4 Governmental Bonds. Buyer acknowledges that none of the bonds, letters of
credit and guarantees, if any, posted by Sellers or their Affiliates with
Governmental Authorities and relating to the Assets are transferable to Buyer.

11.5 Exclusivity. Until the earlier of (a) the Closing or (b) the valid
termination of this Agreement, Sellers shall not, and shall cause their
Affiliates, agents and representatives not to, solicit offers, inquiries or
proposals from or negotiate or participate in discussions with, or disclose
information to, any Third Party in connection with the possible sale of or
other disposition of all or any material portion of the Assets (other than
replacement of equipment or sale of Hydrocarbons in the regular course of
business), or any other transaction involving a change in the ownership of, or
debt or equity financing of, the Assets.

11.6 Revenues.

(a)In the event either (i) Buyer receives revenues attributable to any of the
Assets for any periods prior to the Effective Time or (ii) any Seller receives
revenues attributable to any of the Assets for any periods after the Effective
Time which revenues, in either case, are not accounted for in the Preliminary
Settlement Statement or the Final Settlement Statement, the receiving Party
will hold such revenues for the exclusive benefit of the Party entitled
thereto pursuant to this 

Agreement and, if not taken into account for purposes of the Final Settlement
Statement, shall promptly deliver such funds to the appropriate Party within
thirty (30) days after receipt.

(b)In the event either (i) Buyer pays monies for Operating Expenses
attributable to any of the Assets for any periods prior to the Effective Time,
or (ii) any Seller pays monies for Operating Expenses attributable to any of
the Assets for any periods after the Effective Time which payment, in either
case, is not accounted for in the Preliminary Settlement Statement or the
Final Settlement Statement, then (A) such paying Party shall deliver the owing
Party (or the Seller's Representative, if Buyer is the paying Party) an
invoice and proof of payment with respect to such Operating Expenses, and (B)
within 30 days after receipt of the applicable invoice and proof of payment
are received by Buyer or the Seller's Representative, as applicable, the owing
Party (or the Seller's Representative, if a Seller is the owing Party) shall
reimburse the Party that paid such Operating Expenses.

(c)In the event that any Party (i) receives an invoice of an expense or
obligation which is owed by the other Party, then if such Party receiving the
invoice is (A) a Seller, such Seller shall promptly forward such invoice to
Buyer, and (B) Buyer, Buyer shall promptly forward such invoice to the
Seller's Representative, and (ii) receives an invoice or other evidence of an
obligation that is partially an obligation of both Buyer, on the one hand, and
any Seller, on the other hand, then Buyer and the Seller's Representative
shall consult with each other, and following such consultation each owing
Party shall promptly pay its portion of such obligation to the obligee.

11.7 Financial Information. From and after the date of this Agreement until
December 31, 2022 (the "Records Period"), each Seller who is, or whose
Affiliate is, the operator of any of the Assets shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees,
agents and representatives to, provide reasonable cooperation to Buyer, its
Affiliates and their agents and representatives in connection with Buyer's or
its Affiliates' filings, if any, that are required by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, under securities laws applicable to Buyer and its
Affiliates (collectively, the "Filings", and such afore described Sellers,
each a "Cooperating Seller"). During the Records Period, each Cooperating
Seller agrees to make available to Buyer and its Affiliates and their agents
and representatives any and all books, records, information and documents to
the extent that such are attributable to the Assets in such Cooperating
Seller's or its Affiliates' possession or control and reasonable access to
such Cooperating Seller's and its Affiliates' personnel, in each case as
reasonably required by Buyer, its Affiliates and their agents and
representatives in order to prepare, if required, in connection with the
Filings, financial statements meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Securities Act"), along with any
documentation attributable to the Assets required to complete any audit
associated with such financial statements, which records and information shall
include, for the avoidance of doubt, lease operating statements for the 24
month period prior to the Execution Date. During the Records Period, each
Cooperating Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide
reasonable cooperation to the independent auditors chosen by Buyer ("Buyer's
Auditor") in connection with any audit by Buyer's Auditor of any financial
statements of such Cooperating Seller or its Affiliates with respect to the
Assets that Buyer or any of its Affiliates requires to comply with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with
respect to any Filings. During the Records Period, each Cooperating Seller and
its Affiliates shall retain all books, records, information and documents
relating to the Assets for the three fiscal years prior to 

January 1, 2017 and the period from January 1, 2017 through the Closing Date.
Buyer will reimburse each Cooperating Seller and its Affiliates, within 10
Business Days after demand in writing therefor, for any and all reasonable out
of pocket costs incurred by such Cooperating Seller and its Affiliates in
complying with the provision of this Section 11.7. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 11.7, Buyer, its Affiliates and their agents and
representatives shall act reasonably and shall not unduly interfere with any
employees of any Seller or any Seller's business operations during the Records
Period when performing any actions pursuant to this Section 11.7.

11.8 Non-Competition. Except with respect to any Excluded Assets, each Seller
agrees that, commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is 18
months after the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Buyer,
such Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, acquire any "top
lease" covering any lands covered by any Lease.

11.9 Pending Transaction.

(a)Pursuant to the Pending Transaction, Sellers anticipate acquiring the
assets set forth on Exhibit A-4 (the "Pending Transaction Assets") in exchange
for the assets set forth on Exhibit A-5 (the "Traded-Out Assets"). Seller's
Representative shall notify Buyer within two Business Days after each of (i)
the execution of any definitive agreement (such definitive agreement, together
with all exhibits and schedules thereto and the transaction documents in
connection therewith, the "Pending Transaction Documentation") with respect to
the Pending Transaction and (ii) any closing with respect to the Pending
Transaction (a "Pending Transaction Closing"). Each such written notice shall
specify any changes to the Pending Transaction Assets and shall include all
exhibits, schedules and other documentation, and in the case of a Pending
Transaction Closing, shall include a description of the Pending Transaction
Assets acquired by Sellers at such Pending Transaction Closing (together with
detailed information of each applicable Lease, Unit, Well, Right-of-Way or
Personal Property, the Net Revenue Interest and Working Interest information
for each applicable Well and each Target Formation for each applicable Tract,
and the Net Acres information for each Target Formation for each applicable
Tract), provided, however, that in no event shall any Seller be obligated by
this Section 11.9 to disclose any marketing agreements that are subject to any
confidentiality or similar agreements or obligations in favor of the Pending
Transaction Counterparty or other Third Party (any such marketing agreements,
the "Subject Marketing Agreements"). Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Buyer's prior written consent shall be required for any change in
the Pending Transaction Assets (other than as a result of defects validly
asserted against the Pending Transaction Counterparty by Sellers) or the
Traded-Out Assets. The Allocated Values for the Pending Transaction Assets are
set forth on Exhibit A-1 and Exhibit A-2, as applicable. Pursuant to Section
12.1 and promptly after each Pending Transaction Closing, if any, Sellers
shall afford to Buyer and Buyer's Representatives reasonable access to the
applicable Pending Transaction Assets and all related records and information
in order for Buyer to conduct its investigations and due diligence in
accordance with this Agreement, and the date such access is provided to such
records and information as well as to the Subject Marketing Agreements with
respect to any Pending Transaction Assets subject to a Pending Transaction
Closing shall be referred to as the "Pending Transaction Access Date" for such
Pending Transaction Assets.

(b)If a Pending Transaction Access Date occurs no later than 30 days prior to
the Title Claim Date, the applicable Pending Transaction Assets shall be
considered "Assets" for 

all purposes hereunder and shall be transferred to Buyer at Closing, subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

(c)If a Pending Transaction Closing occurs on or prior to the Closing Date but
the Pending Transaction Access Date occurs later than 30 days prior to the

Transaction Assets shall be considered "Assets" for all purposes hereunder and
shall be transferred to Buyer at Closing, subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, or (ii) the applicable Pending Transaction Assets will not
be conveyed by Sellers to Buyer on the Closing Date and the Purchase Price
payable at Closing will be reduced by the aggregate Allocated Values of such
Pending Transaction Assets.

(d)If a Pending Transaction Closing occurs after the Closing Date or if Buyer
makes the election in Section 11.9(c)(ii), then the applicable Pending
Transaction Assets will not be conveyed by Sellers to Buyer on the Closing
Date and the Purchase Price payable at Closing will be reduced by the
aggregate Allocated Values of such Pending Transaction Assets. In addition,
the following provisions shall apply to such Pending Transaction Assets:

(i)The provisions of Article VIII, Section 13.2, Section 13.3, Section 13.4,
Section 14.1 and Section 14.2 shall apply to each Pending Transaction Asset;
provided that notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, (A) the Closing or the Closing Date for such Pending Transaction
Asset shall be the date set forth in Section 11.9(d)(ii), (B) the Title Claim
Date and the Environmental Claim Date for such Pending Transaction Asset shall
be the date that is 30 days after the Pending Transaction Access Date for such
Pending Transaction Asset, and (C) the application of the Title Deductible
shall take into account the aggregate applicable Title Defect Amounts with
respect to all other Assets pursuant to Section 13.2(i), and the Environmental
Defect Deductible shall take into account the aggregate applicable Remediation
Amounts with respect to all other Assets pursuant to Section 14.1(e).

Section 13.2, Section 13.3, Section 13.4 and Section 14.1, and (B) Sellers
shall assign to Buyer such Pending Transaction Assets pursuant to an
instrument in substantially the same form as the Assignment.

(e)Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, if a
Pending Transaction Closing has not occurred prior the date that is 45 days
following Closing, or if the Pending Transaction Documentation is not
reasonably acceptable to Buyer (which decision Buyer shall irrevocably make
within 5 Business Days of being furnished a final draft of the proposed
Pending Transaction Documentation), then (x) at either Buyer's or Seller's
Representative's option, such Pending Transaction Assets shall be permanently
excluded from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in which case
the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the aggregate Allocated Values of such
Pending Transaction Assets and Sellers shall pay such amount to Buyer within
10 days after such election by Buyer or Seller's Representative, as
applicable, and (y) at either Buyer's or Seller's Representative's option, and
to the extent Sellers may lawfully do so without incurring 

any liability in contract or tort arising out of the Pending Transaction,
Buyer shall acquire the Traded-Out Assets for the price set forth on Exhibit
A-5. If the option in Section 11.9(e)(y) is exercised, the following
provisions shall apply to such Traded-Out Assets:

Environmental Claim Date for such Traded-Out Asset shall be the date that is
30 days after the Traded-Out Asset Access Date for such Traded-Out Asset, and
(C) the application of the Title Deductible shall take into account the
aggregate applicable Title Defect Amounts with respect to all other Assets
pursuant to Section 13.2(i), and the Environmental Defect Deductible shall
take into account the aggregate applicable Remediation Amounts with respect to
all other Assets pursuant to Section 14.1(e).

(iii)Subject to Buyer's and Sellers' rights and obligations under Article

(including any Phase I environmental assessments) with respect to any Assets

(c)Neither Buyer nor any Buyer's Representative shall be entitled to conduct
any sampling, boring, drilling or other invasive investigation activities
(collectively, "Invasive Activities") on or with respect to any of the Assets.
If as a result of any Phase I environmental assessment findings, Buyer's
Representative recommends to Buyer to conduct any Invasive Activities, Buyer
shall notify the Seller's Representative of the affected Asset of such
recommendation in writing. If Seller's Representative does not consent to any
such Invasive Activities proposed by Buyer with respect to a particular Asset
or is unable to grant access to Buyer or its designee to conduct the
recommended Invasive Activities requested by Buyer with respect to any Asset,
Buyer shall have the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to exclude
such Asset affected thereby, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced at
Closing by the Allocated Value of such Asset so excluded.

(d)Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to coordinate its
environmental property assessments and physical inspections of the Assets with
Seller's Representative and all Third Party operators to minimize any
inconvenience to or interruption of the conduct of business by Sellers or such
Third Party operators. Buyer shall abide by Seller's Representative's, and any
Third Party operator's, safety rules, regulations and operating policies of
which Buyer has been made aware in writing while conducting its due diligence
evaluation of the Assets, including any environmental or other inspection or
assessment of the Assets. Except for those Liabilities that result from
discovery of conditions or defects that already existed or with respect to the
Assets prior to or at the time of such investigations, Buyer hereby agrees to
defend, indemnify and hold harmless each of the operators of the Assets and
the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Liabilities
arising out of, resulting from or relating to any field visit, environmental
property assessment, or other due diligence activity conducted by Buyer or any
Buyer's Representative with respect to the Assets, EVEN IF SUCH LIABILITIES
ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, SOLELY OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE,
CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR
VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY A MEMBER OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES,
EXCEPTING ONLY IN THE CASE OF THIS SECTION 12.1(d) (i) LIABILITIES ACTUALLY
RESULTING ON THE ACCOUNT OF THE GROSS 

NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A MEMBER OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES
AND (ii) LIABILITIES THAT WERE EXISTING PRIOR TO SUCH INSPECTIONS.

12.2 Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges that, pursuant to its right of access
to the Records and the Assets, Buyer will become privy to confidential and
other information of Sellers and that such confidential information shall be
held confidential by Buyer and Buyer's Representatives in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. If the Closing should occur, the
foregoing confidentiality restriction on Buyer, including the Confidentiality
Agreement, shall terminate (except as to (a) such portion of the Assets that
are not conveyed to Buyer pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, (b)
the Excluded Assets and (c) information related to assets other than the
Assets).

ARTICLE XIII

TITLE MATTERS; CASUALTY; TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS



13.1 Sellers' Title.

(a)General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations. Without
limiting Buyer's remedies for Title Defects set forth in this Article XIII,
except as set forth in Section 13.1(b), no Seller makes any warranty or
representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to
title to any of the Assets and Tracts and, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
Buyer's sole remedy for any defect of title, including any Title Defect, with
respect to any of the Assets (i) before Closing, shall be as set forth in
Section 13.2, and (ii) after Closing, shall be pursuant to (A) the special
warranty of title to the Wells, Leases, Tracts, Rights-of-Way and Personal
Property contained in the Assignment, and (B) Buyer's rights under Section
8.2(b) with respect to a breach of Section 11.1(b)(iv) or Section 13.4. For
the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement or in the Assignment, after Closing, if an applicable Seller
or Seller's Representative demonstrates that Buyer received, pursuant to the
Assignments (1) an aggregate Net Revenue Interest equal to the aggregate Net
Revenue Interests of all Sellers for each Well and each Target Formation in
each Tract as set forth in Exhibits A-1 and A-2, (2) an aggregate Working
Interest equal to the aggregate Working Interests of all Sellers for each Well
and each Target Formation in each Tract as set forth in Exhibits A-1 and A-2,
and (3) an aggregate number of Net Acres equal to the aggregate number of Net
Acres of all Sellers in each Target Formation in each Tract as set forth in
Exhibit A-2, then in no event shall Buyer have any remedy under clause (ii)(A)
with respect to any claim related to a Net Revenue Interest, Working Interest
or Net Acre deficiency.

(b)Special Warranty of Defensible Title. The Assignment delivered at Closing
will contain a special warranty of Defensible Title as to such Seller's
interest in the Wells, Leases, Tracts, Rights-of-Way and Personal Property by
the applicable Seller, subject, however, to the Permitted Encumbrances. For
the avoidance of doubt, any claim by Buyer under each Seller's special
warranty of Defensible Title in the Assignment shall not be subject to the
Individual Title Threshold or the Title Deductible but shall not exceed the
Allocated Value of the affected Asset and any claims for such breach must be
asserted within the applicable statute of limitations. Any such claims not
asserted within the applicable statute of limitations shall be deemed to be
Assumed Obligations.

13.2 Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments. 

(a)Title Defect Notices. Buyer must deliver (which delivery may be by email),
on or before 5:00 p.m. (Prevailing Central Time) on September 25, 2017 (the
"Title Claim Date"), claim notices to Seller's Representative meeting the
requirements of this Section 13.2(a) (collectively the "Title Defect Notices"
and individually a "Title Defect Notice") setting forth any matters which, in
Buyer's reasonable opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Buyer intends
to assert as a Title Defect pursuant to this Section 13.2. For all purposes of
this Agreement and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (except for
the remedies expressly discussed in Section 13.1), Buyer shall be deemed to
have waived, and no Seller shall have any liability for, any Title Defect that
Buyer fails to assert as a Title Defect by a Title Defect Notice received by
Seller's Representative on or before the Title Claim Date. To be effective,
each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a
description of the alleged Title Defect and a description of the Asset and/or
associated Tract, or any portion thereof, affected by such Title Defect (each
a "Title Defect Property"), (ii) the Allocated Value of each Title Defect
Property, (iii) supporting documents (which may be furnished via access to a
web link or ftp site), to the extent in Buyer's, its Affiliate's, or its Third
Party contractor's possession, reasonably necessary for Seller's
Representative to verify the existence of such Title Defect, (iv) the amount
by which Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect
Property is reduced by such Title Defect and the computations upon which
Buyer's belief is based, and (v) if applicable, each Seller whose interest is
affected by such Title Defect; provided, however, that an alleged failure to
comply with subsections (i) through (v) above shall not cause any such Title
Defect Notice to be invalid or any Title Defect to be waived if the defect
notice is reasonably sufficient to provide notice to Seller's Representative
of the existence and nature of the alleged Title Defect.

(b)Title Benefit Notices. If Buyer discovers any Title Benefit, it shall
promptly deliver notice to Seller's Representative prior to the Title Claim
Date. Seller's Representative shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
deliver to Buyer on or before a time that is at least 24 hours prior to the
Title Claim Date with respect to each Title Benefit a notice (a "Title Benefit
Notice") including (i) a description of the alleged Title Benefit and a
description of the Lease and the associated Tract set forth on Exhibit A-2, or
the Well set forth on Exhibit A-1, or portion thereof, affected by such Title
Benefit (each a "Title Benefit Property"), (ii) the Allocated Value of each
such Title Benefit Property, (iii) supporting documents, to the extent in
Sellers', its Affiliate's, or its Third Party contractor's possession,
reasonably necessary for Buyer to verify the existence of such Title Benefit,
(iv) the amount by which Seller's Representative reasonably believes the
Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property is increased by the Title
Benefit and the computations upon which Seller's Representative's belief is
based, and (v) if applicable, each Seller whose interest is affected by such
Title Benefit.

(c)Sellers' Right to Cure. Subject to the terms of Section 13.2(d), the
Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at the sole
cost of such Sellers, to cure at any time prior to the end of the 75 days
following Closing (the "Cure Period") any Title Defects of which the Sellers
have been advised by Buyer or Seller's Representative. Should any such Seller
wish to attempt to cure any such Title Defect following Closing during the
Cure Period, Seller's Representative must deliver written notice to Buyer of
such election on or before the date that is five Business Days prior to
Closing. At Closing, the Purchase Price will be reduced by the Allocated Value
of each Title Defect Property for which Seller's Representative has provided
such notice to Buyer. Such Title Defect Properties will not be conveyed by any
such Seller to Buyer on the Closing 

Date. Should such Sellers cure the applicable Title Defects to Buyer's
reasonable satisfaction during the Cure Period, then, within 10 Business Days
after such Title Defects are cured to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction, such
Title Defect Properties will be purchased by Buyer and sold by such Seller(s)
for a price equal to the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Properties that
was removed from the Purchase Price at Closing (as such Allocated Value may be
adjusted as provided in this Agreement), with the conveyance of the applicable
Title Defect Properties being made pursuant to an Assignment. Should the
Parties dispute whether such Title Defect was, in fact, cured during the Cure
Period, the provisions of Section 13.2(k) shall govern and control such
dispute.

(d)Remedies for Title Defects. Subject to Seller's Representative's right to
dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount
asserted with respect thereto prior to the Closing Date and subject to the
rights of the Parties pursuant to Section 7.1(f), in the event that any Title
Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 13.2(a) is not
waived in writing by Buyer or cured on or before Closing, then, subject to the
Individual Title Threshold and the Title Deductible:

(i)Buyer may reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Amount (as
determined pursuant to Section 13.2(g) or Section 13.2(k)); or

(ii)solely in instances in which the Title Defect Amount equals 100% of the
Allocated Value of the applicable Title Defect Property, Buyer or the Seller's
Representative may cause the applicable Sellers to retain their respective
interests in the entirety of such Title Defect Property and all associated
Assets, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal
to the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property, and such Title Defect
Property and associated Assets will constitute "Excluded Assets" for all
purposes of this Agreement;

(iii)in the event either remedy set forth above is implemented, then the
Sellers acknowledge and agree that, only for purposes of allocation and
distribution by the Seller's Representative of the Purchase Price (as adjusted
pursuant to this Agreement) among the Sellers, any reduction of the Purchase
Price shall be applied in the following manner: (A) first (1) if only one
Seller's interest resulted in the Title Defect, against the individual
Seller's interest in the Title Defect Property, or (2) if more than one
Seller's interest resulted in the Title Defect, against such Sellers'
interests in the Title Defect Property on a pro rata basis based on each such
Seller's respective Allocated Value in the Title Defect Property; (B) second,
to the extent the reduction of the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to
this Agreement) is not satisfied by the preceding clause (A) above, against
such Seller's (or Sellers', as applicable) interest(s) in all other Assets or
Tracts, including any Title Benefits that are applicable to such Seller(s) in
any other Assets or Tracts; and (C) third, to the extent the reduction of the
Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to this Agreement) is not satisfied by
the preceding clauses (A) and (B) above, against the other Sellers' interests
in the Title Defect Property, on a pro rata basis based on each such Seller's
respective Allocated Value in the Title Defect Property.

(e)Remedies for Title Benefits. With respect to each Title Benefit Property
affected by Title Benefits reported under Section 13.2(b), as Sellers' sole
and exclusive remedies for any Title Benefits, the amount (the "Title Benefit
Amount") equal to the increase in the Allocated Value for such Asset caused by
such Title Benefits, as determined pursuant to Section 13.2(h) or Section
13.2(k), shall, if and only if such Title Benefit Amount is greater than the
Individual 

Title Threshold, be applied as to offset the aggregate Title Defect Amounts
attributable to Title Defects pursuant to Section 13.2(i).

(f)Exclusive Remedy. Except for Buyer's rights (i) under the special warranty
of title to the Wells, Leases, Tracts, Rights-of-Way and Personal Property
contained in the Assignment, (ii) to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(f), and (iii) under Section 8.2(b) with respect to a breach of
Section 11.1(b)(iv) or Section 13.4, the provisions set forth in Section
13.2(d) and Section 13.2(k) shall be the sole and exclusive right and remedy
of Buyer with respect to any Seller's failure to have Defensible Title with
respect to any Asset.

(g)Title Defect Amount. The amount by which the Allocated Value of the
affected Title Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of a
Title Defect shall be the "Title Defect Amount" and shall be determined in
accordance with the following terms and conditions:

(i)if Buyer and Seller's Representative agree on the Title Defect Amount, then
that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(ii)if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated in
amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid
to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

(iii)if (A) the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (1) any Seller's
Net Revenue Interest with respect to any Target Formation for any Tract or
with respect to any Well and (2) such Seller's Net Revenue Interest with
respect to such Target Formation for such Tract or with respect to such Well
as set forth in Exhibits A-2 or A-1, as applicable, and (B) such Seller's
Working Interest with respect to such Target Formation for such Tract or with
respect to such Well is less than such Seller's Working Interest with respect
to such Target Formation for such Tract or with respect to such Well as set
forth in Exhibits A-2 or A-1, as applicable, in the same proportion to such
Net Revenue Interest decrease, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
product of (x) the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property, multiplied
by (y) a fraction, the (I) numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
decrease with respect to such Target Formation for such Tract or with respect
to such Well, and (II) denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest with
respect to such Target Formation for such Tract or with respect to such Well
as set forth in Exhibits A-2 or A-1, as applicable;

(iv)if (A) the Title Defect for any Tract is the actual failure of a Seller to
own the represented Net Acres with respect to any Target Formation for such
Tract as shown under the column titled "Seller Net Acres" on Exhibit A-2
throughout the duration of the productive life of such Tract, and (B) such
Title Defect does not have an adverse impact on the Allocated Value of the
remainder of such Tract, then the Title Defect Amount will be the product of
(x) the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property, multiplied by (y) a
fraction, the (I) numerator of which is the positive difference between the
(a) Net Acres with respect to such Target Formation for such Tract as shown
under the column titled "Seller Net Acres" on Exhibit A-2, and (b) actual Net
Acres held by such Seller with respect to such Target Formation for such
Tract, and (II) denominator of which is the Net Acres with respect to such
Target Formation for such Tract as shown under the column titled "Seller Net
Acres" on Exhibit A-2; provided that, if a Seller's ownership of any
applicable Net Acres in any applicable Target Formation set forth on Exhibit
A-2 for any Tract identified on 

Exhibit A-2 covers less than the full vertical interval in such applicable
Target Formation under such Tract, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
product of (1) the Allocated Value of such Net Acres for such applicable
Target Formation multiplied by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
thickness (in feet) of the vertical interval of such applicable Target
Formation under such Tract not covered by such Seller's ownership of such Net
Acres and the denominator of which is the thickness (in feet) of the full
vertical interval of such applicable Target Formation under such Tract for
such Net Acres;

(v)if the Title Defect represents an obligation, Encumbrance upon or other
defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above,
then the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect
Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect,
the reasonably anticipated economic effect of the Title Defect over the life
of the Title Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer
and Seller's Representative, and such other reasonable factors as are
customarily utilized in the oil and gas industry to make a proper evaluation;

(vi)the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder;

(vii)if a Title Defect does not affect a Title Defect Property throughout the
entire remaining productive life of such Title Defect Property, such fact
shall be taken into account in determining the Title Defect Amount;

(viii)for purposes of Section 13.2(i) only, all Title Defects with respect to
any Well or Tract that are attributable to (A) the interests of more than one
Seller hereunder, or (B) more than one Target Formation shall, in each case,
all be aggregated together for purposes of determining the Title Defect Amount
with respect to the applicable Title Defect Property;

(ix)notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if a Title
Defect results in a Seller not having Defensible Title to a Lease as well as
any corresponding Tract, the Purchase Price shall be reduced only one time
with respect to either the Lease or the Tract and in no event shall Buyer be
entitled to claim a Title Defect Amount with respect to both a Lease and a
Tract for such Title Defect; and

(x)notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article XIII, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any single Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated
Value of such Title Defect Property and no Title Defect Amount shall be
asserted by Buyer with respect to any Well or Tract except as to (A) presently
producing formations in any Well, or (B) the Target Formations in any Tract.

(h)Title Benefit Amount. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title
Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions:

(i)if Buyer and Seller's Representative agree on the Title Benefit Amount,
then that amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount; 

(ii)if (A) the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (1) any Seller's
Net Revenue Interest with respect to any Target Formation for any Tract or
with respect to any Well and (2) such Seller's Net Revenue Interest with
respect to such Target Formation for such Tract or with respect to such Well
as set forth in Exhibits A-2 or A-1, as applicable, and (B) such Seller's
Working Interest with respect to such Target Formation for such Tract or with
respect to such Well is greater than such Seller's Working Interest with
respect to such Target Formation for such Tract or with respect to such Well
as set forth in Exhibits A-2 or A-1, as applicable, in the same proportion to
such Net Revenue Interest increase, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the
product of (1) the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property, multiplied
by (2) a fraction, the (x) numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
increase with respect to such Target Formation for such Tract or Well, and (y)
denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest with respect to such Target
Formation for such Tract or Well as set forth in Exhibits A-2 or A-1, as
applicable;

(iii)if the Title Benefit represents an increase in the Net Acres with respect
to any Target Formation for any Tract owned by a Seller compared to the
represented Net Acres with respect to such Target Formation for such Tract as
shown under the column titled "Seller Net Acres" on Exhibit A-2 throughout the
duration of the productive life of such Tract, then the Title Benefit Amount
will be the product of (x) the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property,
multiplied by (y) a fraction, the (A) numerator of which is the positive
difference between the (I) actual Net Acres held by such Seller with respect
to such Target Formation for such Tract, and (II) Net Acres with respect to
such Target Formation for such Tract as shown under the column titled "Seller
Net Acres" on Exhibit A-2, and (B) denominator of which is the Net Acres with
respect to such Target Formation for such Tract as shown under the column
titled "Seller Net Acres" on Exhibit A-2;

(iv)for purposes of Section 13.2(i) only, all Title Benefits with respect to
any Well or Tract that are attributable to (A) the interests of more than one
Seller hereunder, or (B) more than one Target Formation shall, in each case,
all be aggregated together for purposes of determining the Title Benefit
Amount with respect to the applicable Title Benefit Property; and

(v)if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the Title
Benefit Amounts shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value
of the Title Benefit Property, the portion of the Title Benefit Property
affected by such Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the
potential economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of the Title
Benefit Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and
Seller's Representative and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to
make a proper evaluation.

(i)Title Thresholds and Deductible. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
(i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by any Seller for any individual Title Defect or any
individual Title Benefit for which the Title Defect Amount or the Title
Benefit Amount, as applicable, does not exceed $50,000 (such amount
"Individual Title Threshold"); and (ii) in no event shall there be any
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by any Seller for
any Title Defect that exceeds the Individual Title Threshold unless (A) the
difference of (1) the total Title Defect Amounts of all such Title Defects
that exceed the Individual Title Threshold (excluding any Title Defects cured
by the applicable Seller to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction prior to Closing),
minus (2) the Title Benefit 

Amounts of all Title Benefits that exceed the Individual Title Threshold,
exceeds (B) the Title Deductible, whereupon Buyer shall be entitled to
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies only with respect to the
Title Defect Amounts in excess of the aggregate Title Deductible.

(j)Exceptions to Individual Title Threshold and Title Deductible.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Individual
Title Threshold and Title Deductible shall not apply to: (i) any Title Defect
that results from (whether in whole or in part) the existence of any Retained
Burden; and (ii) any Title Defects and Title Benefits that (A) affect the same
Title Defect Property (whether one or more Sellers are affected by such Title
Defects and/or Title Benefits), but only to the extent such Title Defects and
Title Benefits affect the same Title Defect Property, and (B) the applicable
Seller or Seller's Representative demonstrates will not collectively cause
Buyer to receive (1) an aggregate Net Revenue Interest less than the aggregate
Net Revenue Interests of all Sellers for each Target Formation in the
applicable Title Defect Property as set forth in Exhibits A-1 or A-2, as
applicable, (2) an aggregate Working Interest greater than the aggregate
Working Interests of all Sellers for each Target Formation in the applicable
Title Defect Property as set forth in Exhibits A-1 or A-2, as applicable, and
(3) an aggregate number of Net Acres less than the aggregate number of Net
Acres of all Sellers in each Target Formation in the applicable Title Defect
Property as set forth in Exhibit A-2.

(k)Title Dispute Resolution. Seller's Representative and Buyer shall attempt
to agree on (i) all Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and
Title Benefit Amounts prior to Closing and (ii) the efficacy of any attempted
cure of a Title Defect promptly upon the expiration of the Cure Period. If
Seller's Representative and Buyer are unable to so agree, the Title Defects,
Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefit Amounts or cure in dispute
shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this Section 13.2(k).
There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney licensed in
the State of Texas with at least 10 years' experience in oil and gas titles
involving properties in the regional area in which the Title Defect Properties
are located, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller's
Representative within 15 days after the end of the Cure Period (the "Title
Arbitrator"). In the event the Parties are unable to mutually agree upon the
Title Arbitrator within such time period, then Seller's Representative on the
one hand and Buyer on the other hand shall each nominate a candidate to be the
Title Arbitrator, and such candidates so nominated by the Parties shall
together determine the Title Arbitrator. Seller's Representative and the Buyer
shall each present to the Title Arbitrator, with a simultaneous copy to the
other party, a single written statement of its position on the defect or
benefit in question, together with a copy of this Agreement and any supporting
material that such Party desires to furnish, not later than the 10th Business
Day after appointment of the Title Arbitrator. In making the determination,
the Title Arbitrator, unless the Title Arbitrator requests additional
information from either party, shall make a determination of the matter
submitted based solely on the single written submission of Seller's
Representative and Buyer and shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
Provided, however, the Title Arbitrator may consider available legal and
industry matters as in the Title Arbitrator's opinion are necessary or
appropriate to make a proper determination. The Title Arbitrator's
determination shall be made within 20 Business Days after submission of the
matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon all Parties, without
right of appeal. The Title Arbitrator, however, may not award the Buyer a
greater Title Defect Amount than the Title Defect Amount claimed by Buyer in
its applicable Title Defect Notice or Sellers a greater Title Benefit Amount
than the Title Benefit Amount claimed by Seller's Representative in its 

applicable Title Benefit Notice. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert
for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defect,
Title Benefit, Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefit Amounts and/or cure efforts
submitted by either party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to
either party with respect to any matter. The applicable Sellers and Buyer
shall bear their own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. The
Seller's Representative, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall
each bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator. To the
extent that the award of the Title Arbitrator with respect to any Title Defect
Amount or Title Benefit Amount is not taken into account as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.4 or Section 3.5, then within 10 days
after the Title Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller's
Representative of his award with respect to a Title Defect Amount or a Title
Benefit Amount (and subject to Section 13.2(k)), (A) Buyer shall pay to
Seller's Representative the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title Arbitrator
to Sellers, and (B) such Sellers (severally and not jointly) shall pay to
Buyer the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Buyer. For the
avoidance of doubt, no amounts owing under this Section 13.2(k) by such
Sellers to Buyer shall be paid from the Indemnity Escrow. Nothing herein shall
operate to cause the Closing to be delayed on account of any arbitration
hereunder and to the extent any adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties
as of the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted therefor as of the
Closing by an amount that is equal to the average of (1) the Title Defect
Amount claimed in good faith by the Seller's Representative and (2) the Title
Defect Amount claimed in good faith by Buyer, and subsequent adjustments
thereto, if any, will be made pursuant to Section 3.5 or this Section 13.2(k).

13.3 Casualty Loss. If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing
Date, any portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or is
taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain (each, a "Casualty
Loss"), then (a) subject to the Parties' rights pursuant to Section 7.1(f),
Buyer shall nevertheless be required to close, (b) each Seller, at the
Closing, shall (i) pay to Buyer all sums actually paid to such Seller by Third
Parties by reason of such Casualty Loss insofar as with respect to such Assets
and (ii) assign, transfer and set over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of
such Sellers' right, title and interest (if any) in insurance claims, rights
to compensation under condemnation or eminent domain, unpaid awards and other
rights against Third Parties (excluding any Liabilities, other than insurance
claims, of or against any such Seller's Seller Indemnified Parties) arising
out of such Casualty Loss insofar as with respect to the Assets, and (c) the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward to the extent, if any, that such
sums and such rights are not sufficient to cover the entire amount of such
Casualty Loss; provided, however, that each Seller shall reserve and retain
(and Buyer shall assign to each Seller) all rights, title, interests and
claims against Third Parties for the recovery of such Seller's costs and
expenses incurred prior to the Closing in pursuing or asserting any such
insurance claims or other rights against Third Parties with respect to any
such Casualty Loss.

13.4 Consents to Assign and Preferential Purchase Rights.

(a)Seller's Representative shall (i) within 10 days after the Execution Date,
send to each holder of a (A) right to consent to assignment pertaining to the
Assets and the transactions contemplated hereby, a notice seeking such
holder's consent to the transactions contemplated hereby, and (B) Preferential
Purchase Right, a notice in accordance with the agreement giving rise to such
right informing such holder of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii)
prior to sending, give 

Buyer a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such notices and
incorporate Buyer's reasonable comments thereto.

(b)If any Seller (or Seller's Representative on its behalf) fails to obtain a
Hard Consent applicable to any of its Asset(s) prior to the Closing or any
consent request is rejected in writing by the holder thereof, then, in each
such case, the affected Asset(s) shall be excluded from the Assets to be
acquired by Buyer at Closing hereunder and the Purchase Price shall be reduced
by the Allocated Value of the Asset(s) so excluded (which, for the avoidance
of doubt, shall affect only the impacted Seller(s)). In the event that any
such consent (with respect to any applicable Asset(s) excluded pursuant to
this Section 13.4(b)) that was not obtained prior to Closing is obtained
within 180 days following Closing, then, Buyer shall purchase from such
affected Seller(s), within 10 days after such consent is obtained, such
Asset(s) so excluded under the terms of this Agreement for the amount by which
the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing due to the exclusion of such
Asset(s) (as such amount is appropriately adjusted in accordance to Section
3.3 with respect to such Asset(s)), and such Seller shall assign to Buyer such
Asset(s) pursuant to an assignment in the form of the Assignment and shall be
entitled to receipt of such payment.

(c)If any Seller (or Seller's Representative on its behalf) fails to obtain a
consent prior to the Closing and (i) such consent is not a Hard Consent and
(ii) such consent was not rejected in writing by the holder thereof, then the
Asset(s) subject to such un-obtained consent shall be acquired by Buyer at
Closing as part of the Assets.

(d)If any Preferential Purchase Right is exercised prior to the Closing Date,
or if the time frame for the exercise of such Preferential Purchase Right has
not expired as of the Closing Date and the applicable Seller (or Seller's
Representative on its behalf) has not received a written waiver of the
Preferential Purchase Right, then that portion of the Assets affected by such
Preferential Purchase Right shall be excluded from the Assets at Closing and
the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of such affected Assets (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall only impact the affected Seller(s)).

(e)If a Third Party exercises its Preferential Purchase Right, but does not
consummate the applicable transaction within the time frame specified in the
Preferential Purchase Right (provided that the reason therefor is not such
Seller's default), such Seller agrees to convey its interest in the affected
Asset to Buyer as soon as possible after the expiration of the time for
consummation of the applicable transaction by the holder of the Preferential
Purchase Right (provided that the same occurs within 180 days following
Closing), such conveyance to be effective as of the Effective Time, and Buyer
agrees to pay the Seller's Representative on behalf of such Seller(s) the
Allocated Value of the affected Asset (as adjusted in accordance with Section
3.3 to reflect such conveyance being made as of the Effective Time).

(f)If a Preferential Purchase Right is not discovered prior to Closing, and
the affected Asset is conveyed to Buyer at Closing, and the Preferential
Purchase Right is exercised after Closing, Buyer agrees to convey such
affected Asset to the Third Party exercising such right on the same terms and
conditions under which such Seller(s) conveyed such Asset to Buyer (with the
purchase price being the Allocated Value for the affected Asset as adjusted
pursuant to Section 3.3 and such other adjustments as may be permitted to
reflect any other post-Closing expenditures Buyer has made with respect to
such Asset) and Buyer shall retain all amounts paid by the party 

exercising such Preferential Purchase Right. In the event of such exercise,
Buyer shall prepare, execute and deliver a form of conveyance of such Asset to
such exercising party, such conveyance to be in form and substance as provided
in this Agreement.

ARTICLE XIV

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS



14.1 Notice of Environmental Defects.

(a)Environmental Defect Notices. If Buyer discovers any Environmental
Condition which, in its reasonable opinion, Buyer determines constitutes an
Environmental Defect, Buyer shall notify Seller's Representative on or before
5:00 p.m. (Prevailing Central Time) on September 25, 2017 (the "Environmental
Claim Date") of such Environmental Defect (an "Environmental Defect Notice").
An Environmental Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a
description of the Environmental Condition constituting the asserted
Environmental Defect(s), (ii) the Asset(s) (or portions thereof) affected by
the asserted Environmental Defect (each, an "Environmental Defect Property"),
(iii) documentation, including any physical measurements or, to the extent
permitted by Seller's Representative under Section 12.1, lab analyses or
photographs, sufficient for Seller's Representative to verify the existence of
the asserted Environmental Defect(s), in each case, to the extent in Buyer's,
its Affiliate's, or its Third Party contractor's possession, (iv) the
Allocated Value of each Environmental Defect Property, (v) the Remediation
Amount (itemized in reasonable detail) that Buyer asserts is attributable to
such Environmental Defect and the computations and information upon which
Buyer's belief is based; provided, however, that an alleged failure to comply
with subsections (i) through (v) above shall not cause any such Environmental
Defect Notice to be invalid or any Environmental Defect to be waived if the
defect notice is reasonably sufficient to provide notice to Seller's
Representative of the existence and general nature of the alleged
Environmental Defect. Buyer's calculation of the Remediation Amount included
in the Environmental Defect Notice must describe in reasonable detail the
Remediation proposed for the Environmental Condition that gives rise to the
asserted Environmental Defect and identify assumptions used by the Buyer in
calculating the Remediation Amount. For all purposes of this Agreement but
subject to Buyer's remedy for a breach of Sellers' representation contained in
Section 9.14, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Sellers shall have no
liability for, any Environmental Defect which Buyer fails to assert as an
Environmental Defect by an Environmental Defect Notice received by Seller's
Representative on or before the Environmental Claim Date. Sellers shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to cure any asserted Environmental Defect
to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction on or before Closing.

(b)Sellers' Right to Cure. Subject to the terms of Section 14.1(c), the
Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at the sole
cost of such Sellers, to cure at any time prior to the end of the Cure Period
any Environmental Defects of which the Sellers or Seller's Representative have
been advised by Buyer in a timely Environmental Defect Notice. Should any such
Seller wish to attempt to cure any such Environmental Defect following Closing
during the Cure Period, Seller's Representative must deliver written notice to
Buyer of such election on or before the date that is five Business Days prior
to Closing. At Closing, the Purchase Price will be 

reduced by the Allocated Value of each Environmental Defect Property for which
Seller's Representative has provided such notice to Buyer. Such Environmental
Defect Properties will not be conveyed by any such Seller to Buyer on the
Closing Date. Should such Sellers cure the applicable Environmental Defects to
Buyer's reasonable satisfaction during the Cure Period, then, within 10
Business Days after such Environmental Defects are cured to Buyer's reasonable
satisfaction, such Environmental Defect Properties will be purchased by Buyer
and sold by such Seller(s) for a price equal to the Allocated Value of such
Environmental Defect Properties that were removed from the Purchase Price at
Closing (as such Allocated Value may be adjusted as provided in this
Agreement), with the conveyance of the applicable Environmental Defect
Properties being made pursuant to an Assignment. Should the Parties dispute
whether such Environmental Defect was, in fact, cured during the Cure Period,
the provisions of Section 14.1(f) shall govern and control such dispute.

(c)Remedies for Environmental Defects. Subject to the Seller's
Representative's right to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect
and/or the Remediation Amount asserted with respect thereto prior to the
Closing Date, and subject to the rights of the Parties pursuant to Section
7.1(f), in the event that any Environmental Defect timely asserted by Buyer in
accordance with Section 14.1(a) is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured on
or before Closing, then, subject to the Individual Environmental Defect
Threshold and the Environmental Defect Deductible, Buyer shall, at its sole
option, elect to:

(i)reduce the Purchase Price by the Remediation Amount, which reduction, for
purposes of allocation and distribution of the Purchase Price among Sellers,
shall be applied against the affected individual Seller's interest if less
than all Sellers are affected by such Environmental Defect;

(ii)cause the applicable Sellers to assume responsibility for the Remediation
of such Environmental Defect and complete the Remediation with respect to the
affected Assets to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction before the end of the Cure
Period; or

(iii)solely in instances in which the Remediation Amount exceeds 50% of the
Allocated Value of the Environmental Defect Property, cause the applicable
Sellers to retain their respective interests in the entirety of such
Environmental Defect Property and all associated Assets, in which event the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
such Environmental Defect Property, which reduction, for purposes of
allocation and distribution of the Purchase Price among Sellers, shall be
applied against the affected individual Seller's interest if less than all
Sellers are affected by such Environmental Defect, and such Environmental
Defect Property and associated Assets will constitute "Excluded Assets" for
all purposes of this Agreement.

If Buyer elects the option set forth in clause (i) above, Buyer shall be
deemed to have assumed responsibility for all of the costs and expenses
attributable to the Remediation of the Environmental Condition attributable to
such Environmental Defect and such responsibility of Buyer shall be deemed to
constitute part of the Assumed Obligations hereunder. If Buyer elects the
option set forth in clause (ii) above, the affected Sellers shall use
reasonable efforts to implement such Remediation in a manner which is
consistent with the requirements of Environmental Laws in a timely fashion for
the type of Remediation that Seller's Representative and Buyer agree that
Sellers will undertake and Buyer, effective as of the Closing, grants to
Seller's Representative, access to the to conduct 

such Remediation. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
in those instances in which Buyer's request to conduct invasive investigations
of certain Assets made under Section 12.1(c) is denied by Seller's
Representative and Buyer elects to withdraw the affected Assets from the
purchase and sale under this Agreement and such Assets as a consequence are
deemed Excluded Assets pursuant to Section 12.1(c), the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by the aggregate amount of the Allocated Values of such Assets
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall only impact the affected Seller(s))
pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(iv) and such Sellers shall have no option to pursue
any other remedy with respect to same.

(d)Exclusive Remedy. Except as provided in Section 8.2(a) for a breach of such
Seller's representations and warranties set forth in Section 9.14 and Buyer's
rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f), the provisions
set forth in Section 14.1(c) and Section 14.1(f) shall be the exclusive right
and remedy of Buyer with respect to any Environmental Defect with respect to
any Asset.

(e)Environmental Thresholds and Deductible. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price
or other remedies provided by any Sellers for any individual Environmental
Defect for which the Remediation Amount does not exceed $75,000 (such amount
"Individual Environmental Defect Threshold"); and (ii) in no event shall there
be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by any
Seller for any Environmental Defect for which the Remediation Amount exceeds
the Individual Environmental Defect Threshold unless (A) the total Remediation
Amounts of all such Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual
Environmental Defect Threshold (excluding any Environmental Defects cured by
Sellers to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction prior to Closing) exceeds (B) the
Environmental Defect Deductible, whereupon Buyer shall be entitled to
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies only with respect to such
Environmental Defects in excess of the Environmental Defect Deductible (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall only impact the affected Seller(s)).

(f)Environmental Dispute Resolution. Seller's Representative and Buyer shall
attempt to agree on (i) all Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts
prior to Closing, and (ii) the efficacy of any attempted cure of an
Environmental Defect promptly upon the expiration of the Cure Period. If
Seller's Representative and Buyer are unable to so agree, the Environmental
Defects, Remediation Amounts and/or cure in dispute shall be exclusively and
finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Section 14.1(f). There shall
be a single arbitrator, who shall be an environmental attorney with at least
15 years' experience in environmental matters involving oil and gas producing
properties in the regional area in which the affected Assets are located, as
selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller's Representative within 15
days after the Closing Date (the "Environmental Arbitrator"). In the event the
Parties are unable to mutually agree upon the Environmental Arbitrator within
such time period, then Seller's Representative on the one hand and Buyer on
the other hand shall each nominate a candidate to be the Environmental
Arbitrator, and such candidates so nominated by the parties shall together
determine the Environmental Arbitrator. Seller's Representative and the Buyer
shall each present to the Environmental Arbitrator, with a simultaneous copy
to the other party, a single written statement of its position on the defect
in question, together with a copy of this Agreement and any supporting
material that such party desires to furnish, not later than the 10th Business
Day after appointment of the Environmental Arbitrator. 

In making the determination, the Environmental Arbitrator, unless the
Environmental Arbitrator requests additional information from either party,
shall make a determination of the matter submitted based solely on the single
written submission of Seller's Representative and Buyer and shall be bound by
the terms of this Agreement. Provided, however, the Environmental Arbitrator
may consider available legal and industry matters as in the Environmental
Arbitrator's opinion are necessary or appropriate to make a proper
determination. The Environmental Arbitrator's determination shall be made
within 20 days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final
and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. The Environmental
Arbitrator, however, may not award Buyer any greater Remediation Amount than
the Remediation Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Environmental Defect
Notice. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental Defects and/or
Remediation Amounts submitted by either party and may not award damages,
interest or penalties to either party with respect to any matter. Sellers and
Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its
case. The Seller's Representative, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, shall each bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Environmental
Arbitrator. Nothing herein shall operate to cause the Closing to be delayed on
account of any arbitration hereunder and to the extent any adjustments are not
agreed upon by the Parties as of the Closing, then the applicable
Environmental Defect Property and all associated Assets shall be excluded from
the Assets to be conveyed to Buyer at Closing, in which event the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such
excluded Environmental Defect Property and associated Assets. Within 10 days
after the Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and
Seller's Representative of his award with respect to a Remediation Amount (and
subject to Section 14.1(c) and Section 14.1(e)), should the Remediation Amount
of such Environmental Defect Property (A) not exceed the Allocated Value
threshold set forth in Section 14.1(c)(iii), then such Asset(s) so excluded
under the terms of this Section 14.1(f) shall be assigned to Buyer by the
applicable Sellers pursuant to an assignment in the form of the Assignment for
the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing due to the
exclusion of such Asset(s) (as such amount is appropriately adjusted in
accordance to Section 3.3 with respect to such Asset(s) and in accordance with
Section 14.1(c) as a result of the Environmental Arbitrator's decision), or
(B) meet or exceed the Allocated Value threshold set forth in Section
14.1(c)(iii), the Buyer shall have the option to receive an assignment of such
Assets in the manner described in subpart (A) above or choose to exclude such
Assets permanently pursuant to its rights under Section 14.1(c)(iii).

14.2 NORM, Wastes and Other Substances. Buyer acknowledges that the Assets
have been used for exploration, development, production, gathering and
transportation of oil and gas and there may be petroleum, produced water,
wastes or other substances or materials located in, on or under the Assets or
associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites included in the Assets may
contain asbestos, NORM or other Hazardous Substances. NORM may affix or attach
itself to the inside of wells, pipelines, materials and equipment as scale, or
in other forms. The wells, materials and equipment located on the Assets or
included in the Assets may contain NORM and other wastes or Hazardous
Substances. NORM containing material and/or other wastes or Hazardous
Substances may have come in contact with various environmental media,
including, water, soils or sediment. Special procedures may be required for
the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation or disposal of
environmental media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and other Hazardous Substances
from the Assets. For the avoidance of doubt (a) NORM shall not, by itself,
constitute the basis of a breach 

of Sellers' representations and warranties set forth in Section 9.14, and (b)
to the extent an Environmental Condition is based on NORM that is presently in
compliance with applicable Environmental Laws, it shall not constitute the
basis of an Environmental Defect.

MISCELLANEOUS



15.1 Exhibits and Schedules.

(a)All of the Exhibits and Schedules referred to in this Agreement (including
those Exhibits and Schedules that are specific to an individual Seller)
constitute a part of this Agreement (it being understood that, with respect to
those Schedules that are that are specific to an individual Seller, such
Schedules shall constitute a part of this Agreement only as to such Seller).
Sellers and Buyer and their respective counsel have received a complete set of
Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement prior to and as of the execution of
this Agreement.

(b)Unless the context requires otherwise or unless otherwise indicated in the
Schedules, capitalized terms used but not defined in the Schedules have their
respective meanings set forth in this Agreement. Disclosure of any fact or
item by a Seller in any of the Schedules shall be deemed to have been
disclosed with respect to every other Section of Article IX that contains a
reference to a Schedule, but only to the extent it is readily apparent on the
face of such Schedule that such disclosure is applicable with respect to such
other Section. The headings in the Schedules are for convenience of reference
only and shall not affect the disclosures contained therein. References in the
Schedules to any Contract shall be deemed to refer to any and all amendments,
restatements, supplements, other modifications, exhibits and schedules
thereto.

(c)No information contained in the Schedules shall be deemed to be an
admission by any Seller to any other Party or Third Party of any matter
whatsoever (including any violation of Law or breach of Contract). In
disclosing the information in the Schedules, each Seller expressly does not
waive any attorney-client privilege associated with any such information or
any protection afforded by the "work product doctrine" with respect to any of
the matters disclosed or discussed therein. Neither the specification of any
item or matter in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules is intended to imply
that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the
ordinary course of business, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting
forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or
controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described in this Agreement or included in the Schedules is or is not in
the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. No disclosure
of any matter contained in the Schedules will create an implication that such
matter meets any standard of materiality (it being further understood and
agreed that (i) matters reflected in the Schedules are not necessarily limited
to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in such Schedules, which
additional matters are included for informational purposes only and do not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature, and (ii) the inclusion
of any item in any Schedule will not be construed as implying that any 

such item is "material" for any purpose). Nothing in any Schedule is intended
or shall be construed to broaden the scope of any representation or warranty
made by such Seller in this Agreement.

15.2 Expenses and Taxes.

(a)All fees, costs and expenses incurred by Sellers or Buyer in negotiating
this Agreement or in consummating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the Person incurring the same, including, legal and
accounting fees, costs and expenses.

(b)All required documentary, filing and recording fees and expenses in
connection with the filing and recording of the assignments (including the
Assignment), conveyances or other instruments required to convey title to the
Assets to Buyer shall be borne by Buyer. Each Seller shall remain responsible
for, and shall bear and pay, all Income Taxes incurred by or imposed on such
Seller, its direct or indirect owners or Affiliates, or any combined, unitary,
or consolidated group of which any of the foregoing is or was a member, and no
such Taxes shall be taken into account as adjustments to the Purchase Price
under Section 3.3. Buyer shall assume responsibility for, and shall bear and
pay, all state sales, use, transfer and similar Taxes incurred or imposed with
respect to the transactions described in this Agreement (the "Transfer
Taxes"). Each Seller shall remain responsible for, and shall bear and pay, all
Asset Taxes attributable for such Seller for (i) any period ending on or
before the Effective Time, and (ii) the portion of any Straddle Period ending
at the Effective Time. All Asset Taxes arising after the Effective Time
(including all Straddle Period Asset Taxes not apportioned to Sellers) shall
be allocated to and borne by Buyer. Upon determination of the actual amount of
Asset Taxes, to the extent not taken into account under Section 3.3, payments
will be made to cause the appropriate Party to bear the Asset Taxes allocable
to such Person under this Section 15.2(b). For purposes of allocation among
the Parties of Asset Taxes that are payable with respect to Straddle Periods,
(A) Asset Taxes that are attributable to the severance or production of
Hydrocarbons shall be allocated to the period in which the severance or
production giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, (B) Asset Taxes that are
based upon or related to income or receipts or imposed on a transactional
basis (other than such Asset Taxes described in clause (A) or (C)), shall be
allocated to the period in which the transaction giving rise to such Asset
Taxes occurred, and (C) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem, property or other
Asset Taxes imposed on a periodic basis pertaining to a Straddle Period shall
be allocated between the portion of such Straddle Period ending at the
Effective Time and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning immediately
following the Effective Time by prorating each such Asset Tax based on the
number of days in the applicable Straddle Period that occur on or before the
day on which the Effective Time occurs, on the one hand, and the number of
days in such Straddle Period that occur after the day on which the Effective
Time occurs, on the other hand.

(c)Sellers shall timely file any Tax Return with respect to Asset Taxes due on
or before the Closing Date or that otherwise relates solely to periods before
the Closing Date (a "Pre-Closing Tax Return") and shall pay any Asset Taxes
shown due and owing on such Pre-Closing Tax Return. From and after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall timely file any Tax Returns with respect to Asset Taxes
required to be filed after the Closing Date, including for any Straddle Period
(a "Post-Closing Tax Return"), and, subject to Buyer's indemnification rights
under Article VIII, shall be responsible for the payment to the applicable
Taxing Authorities of all Asset Taxes that become due and payable after the
Closing Date. Buyer shall file any Post-Closing Tax Return in a 

manner consistent with past practice except as otherwise required by Law. The
Parties agree that (i) this Section 15.2(c) is intended to solely address the
timing and manner in which certain Tax Returns relating to Asset Taxes are
filed and the Asset Taxes shown thereon are paid to the applicable Taxing
Authority, and (ii) nothing in this Section 15.2(c) shall be interpreted as
altering the manner in which Asset Taxes are allocated to and economically
borne by the Parties.

(d)Any payments made to any Party pursuant to Article VIII shall constitute an
adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and shall be treated as such
by Buyer and Sellers on their Tax Returns to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

(e)The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested in connection with the filing of any Tax Returns, the qualification
for any exemption or reduction in Tax that may be available, any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to these matters for the Assets.
Such cooperation shall include the retention of records and information which
are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Buyer agrees to allow access (upon request) to the Assets by Seller's
Representative and their auditors and State or Federal representatives
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding.

15.3 Assignment. Except in the case of assignment by Buyer to an Affiliate or
as otherwise provided in Section 15.16, this Agreement may not be assigned by
Buyer or Sellers without the prior written consent of (a) if Buyer is the
Party desiring to make such assignment, the Seller's Representative, and (b)
if a Seller is the Party desiring to make such assignment, Buyer. In the event
Buyer or the Seller's Representative, as applicable, consent to any such
assignment requiring consent, unless otherwise agreed by such Persons, such
assignment shall not relieve the assigning Party of any obligations and
responsibilities hereunder.

15.4 Interpretation. Buyer, Sellers, their respective counsel and Buyer's
Representatives participated in the review and/or preparation of this
Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules). In the event of any
ambiguity in this Agreement, all Parties acknowledge and agree that no
presumption shall arise based on the identity of the draftsman or preparer of
this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules). Certain of the Exhibits
and Schedules to this Agreement are prepared in good faith by Buyer and/or
Buyer's Representatives based on information provided by Seller's
Representative or its representatives or designees. Without limiting the
foregoing and notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Parties agree and acknowledge that Buyer's rights, claims and
remedies under this Agreement shall in no way be limited or prejudiced by
Buyer's and Buyer's Representatives' role in or knowledge acquired as a result
of or in connection with preparing such Exhibits and Schedules and drafting
this Agreement.

15.5 Publicity.

(a)No Party shall make or issue any press release or other public
announcements concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the prior consent of (i) if Buyer is the Party desiring to make any
such release or announcement, the Seller's Representative, and (ii) if a
Seller is the Party desiring to make any such release or announcement, Buyer,
in each case, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In
no event may any Party make or 

issue any press release or other public announcements concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement until the Deposit has been
deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 3.2. If a Party desires to
make a public announcement, it shall first give Buyer or the Seller's
Representative, as applicable, 48 hours written notification of its desire to
make such a public announcement. The written notification shall include (A) a
request for consent to make the announcement, and (B) a written draft of the
text of such public announcement. Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers and
Seller's Representative, on the other hand, shall each use their reasonable
efforts to consult with the other Parties regarding the contents of any such
release or announcement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 15.5(a), in no event shall any Seller be identified by name in any
press release or public announcement made pursuant to this Section 15.5(a).

(b)Nothing in this Section 15.5 shall prohibit any Party from issuing or
making a public announcement or statement if such Party deems it, in its sole
but reasonable and good faith discretion (i) necessary to do so in order to
comply with any applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange having
jurisdiction of a Party or a Party's Affiliates, or (ii) desirable with
respect to the investment community at large; provided, however, that (A) no
disparaging remarks shall be made regarding any Seller and (B) to the extent
practical, prior written notification shall be given to the other Parties
prior to any such announcement or statement.

15.6 Notices. All notices and communications required or permitted to be given
hereunder shall be sufficient in all respects if given in writing and

Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or taking such action (and
the expiration date of such period during which notice is required to be given
or action taken) shall be the next day which is a Business Day.

15.7 Seller's Representative.

(a)Each Seller exclusively and irrevocably appoints JM Cox as its
representative with full authority and power without limitation to execute all
instruments (other than any Assignment or any certificate required pursuant to
Section 4.1(c)), to perform all covenants and obligations, to grant such
waivers and consents on behalf of such Seller under this Agreement, to
exercise all rights on such Seller's behalf in connection with the performance
of this Agreement and to amend this Agreement except to the extent such
amendment would decrease the Purchase Price or adversely and
disproportionately affect such Seller without such Seller's consent, in each
case, as Seller's Representative in its sole discretion shall deem advisable,
both prior to and after Closing.

(b)JM Cox in its capacity as representative appointed under Section 15.7(a) is
"Seller's Representative."

(c)Without in any way limiting the authority and power set forth in Sections
15.7(a), each Seller irrevocably appoints the Seller's Representative the
agent and attorney-in-fact of such Seller for the purposes of acting in the
name and stead of such Seller in: (i) giving and receiving all notices
permitted or required by this Agreement and acting on behalf of such Sellers
for all 

purposes under this Agreement; (ii) dealing with Buyer in connection with any
and all adjustments to the Purchase Price under this Agreement (including
negotiating and settling any dispute regarding any such adjustments on behalf
of such Sellers); (iii) acting on such Seller's behalf under any covenant,
agreement or provision of this Agreement; (iv) agreeing with Buyer as to any
amendments to this Agreement or waivers of any terms of this Agreement which
Seller's Representative may reasonably deem necessary or advisable, including
the extension of time in which to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and the waiver of any closing conditions; (v) employing legal
counsel; (vi) paying any legal and any other fees, costs and expenses incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (vii)
granting any consent or approval on behalf of such Seller under this
Agreement; (viii) determining whether the conditions to Closing in Article V
have been satisfied and supervising the Closing, including waiving any such
condition if Seller's Representative, in its sole discretion, determine that
such waiver is appropriate; (ix) taking any action that may be necessary or
desirable, as determined by Seller's Representative in its sole discretion, in
connection with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article
VII; (x) serving as payment agent for Sellers and otherwise making the
determinations referenced by Section 2.4 in accordance with Section 2.4,
including directing the timing, making and manner of payment of the Purchase
Price (as adjusted pursuant to this Agreement) hereunder equitably among the
Sellers in accordance with this Agreement as contemplated by Section 2.4; (xi)
dealing with Buyer in connection with the determination, dispute, negotiation
and settlement of any Title Defects or Environmental Defects; and (xii)
making, executing, acknowledging, and delivering all such contracts, orders,
receipts, notices, requests, instructions, certificates, letters, and other
writings, and in general doing all things and taking all actions which
Seller's Representative, in its sole discretion, may consider necessary or
proper in connection with or to carry out the terms of this Agreement, as
fully as if such Sellers were personally present and acting. This power of
attorney and all authority conferred hereby is granted and conferred subject
to the interests of the other parties to this Agreement, and in consideration
of those interests and for the purpose of completing the transactions
contemplated hereby, this power of attorney and all authority conferred hereby
shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated by the Sellers or by
operation of Law, whether by the incapacity of any of the Sellers or by the
occurrence of any other event. As the representative of the Sellers, Seller's
Representative shall act as the agent for all such Persons, shall have
authority to bind each such Person in accordance with this Agreement, and
Buyer shall be fully protected in relying conclusively without any
investigation upon any notices, instruction, dealings, and actions of Seller's
Representative within the scope of this Section 15.7 and the power of attorney
contained herein.

(d)Each Seller exclusively and irrevocably appoints the Seller's
Representative, acting jointly, with full authority and power to execute the
Escrow Agreement, to perform all covenants and obligations under the Escrow
Agreement, to execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent under the
Escrow Agreement, to grant waivers and consents under the Escrow Agreement, to
exercise all rights in connection with the performance of the Escrow Agreement
and to amend the Escrow Agreement, in each case, as the Seller's
Representative in its sole discretion shall deem advisable, during the term of
the Escrow Agreement. Each Seller agrees that Buyer and Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely on this granting of power of attorney in all respects.

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Seller's
Representative shall not owe any fiduciary duties to the Sellers and shall not
have any Liability of any kind 

whatsoever to the Sellers arising hereunder or in any way related to any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including for any action taken, or
omission made, by Seller's Representative while acting in good faith in the
absence of bad faith or willful misconduct and each Seller hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally forever releases Seller's Representative from any and all
Liability of any kind whatsoever arising hereunder or in any way related to
any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including for any action taken,
or omission made, by the Seller's Representative while acting in good faith,
except (and only to the extent) of bad faith or willful misconduct by Seller's
Representative. The Seller's Representative may, in all matters arising in
connection with this Agreement, rely on the advice of counsel and the Seller's
Representative shall not be liable to the Sellers for anything done, omitted,
or suffered in good faith based on such advice in the absence of bad faith or
willful misconduct by the Seller's Representative. The Seller's Representative
undertakes to perform such duties herein and only such duties as are
specifically set forth in this Agreement and no implied covenants or
obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Seller's
Representative.

(f)Buyer, the Escrow Agent and all other Persons shall have the right to rely
upon all actions taken or omitted to be taken by Seller's Representative
pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Sellers do hereby agree that Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have no Liability
to any Seller or Seller's Representative as a result of any action or inaction
by Seller's Representative in the performance of this Agreement or any action
or inaction of any Buyer Indemnified Party at the request or instruction of
Seller's Representative related to this Agreement, and Sellers do hereby agree
to defend, indemnify, hold harmless and forever release Buyer Indemnified
Parties from any such Liability, including for the avoidance of doubt, any
distribution of any portion of the Adjusted Purchase Price paid to the
Seller's Representative.

(g)The authorizations of the Seller's Representative under this Section 15.7
shall be effective until its rights and obligations under this Agreement
terminate by virtue of the termination of all obligations of each Seller under
this Agreement.

(h)Without in any way limiting the authority and power granted to the Seller's
Representative hereunder, the Seller's Representative is expressly authorized
to withhold (and otherwise make provision for) any amounts that they determine
in their sole discretion as being sufficient to (i) satisfy any anticipated or
potential downward adjustments to the Purchase Price, it being understood that
any amounts so withheld for such purpose that are remaining after the Final
Payment Date will be distributed to the Sellers in accordance with Section 2.4
promptly after the Final Payment Date, and (ii) to satisfy any anticipated or
potential liabilities or other obligations potentially arising hereunder
affecting any Sellers in the group of Sellers which it represents hereunder,
if and to the extent that Seller's Representative determines in its sole
discretion acting reasonably and in good faith that such is in the collective
best interest of Sellers, it being understood that any such remaining amounts
so withheld will be distributed to the Sellers in accordance with Section 2.4
promptly after Seller's Representative determines in its sole discretion
acting reasonably and in good faith that such distribution is in the
collective best interest of Sellers.

15.8 Further Cooperation. After the Closing, Sellers and Buyer shall execute
and deliver, or shall cause to be executed and delivered, from time to time
such further instruments of conveyance and transfer, and shall take such other
actions as Seller's Representative or Buyer may reasonably 

request, to convey and deliver the Assets to Buyer, to perfect Buyer's title
thereto and to accomplish the orderly transfer of the Assets to Buyer in the
manner contemplated by this Agreement.

15.9 Filings, Notices and Certain Governmental Approvals. Promptly after the
Closing, Buyer shall (a) record all assignments of state Leases executed at
the Closing in the records of the applicable Governmental Authority, and (b)
actively pursue all Customary Post-Closing Consents, that, in each case, shall
not have been obtained prior to the Closing. Buyer obligates itself to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents, including the posting
of any and all bonds or other security that may be required in excess of its
existing lease, pipeline or area-wide bond.

15.10 Entire Agreement; Conflicts.

(a)THIS AGREEMENT, THE EXHIBITS AND SCHEDULES HERETO, THE OTHER TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT COLLECTIVELY CONSTITUTE THE ENTIRE
AGREEMENT AMONG SELLERS AND BUYER PERTAINING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF AND
SUPERSEDE ALL PRIOR AGREEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS, NEGOTIATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS,
WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OF SELLERS AND BUYER PERTAINING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER
HEREOF.

(b)The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that, in the event that the
Closing occurs, except as and to the extent provided in Section 12.2, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be terminated automatically effective as of
the Closing Date.

(c)IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF ANY EXHIBIT HERETO, THE TERMS AND
PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL GOVERN AND CONTROL; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT
THE INCLUSION IN ANY OF THE EXHIBITS HERETO OF TERMS AND PROVISIONS NOT
ADDRESSED IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE DEEMED A CONFLICT, AND ALL SUCH
ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS SHALL BE GIVEN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT, SUBJECT TO THE
PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 15.10.

15.11 Parties in Interest. The terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is
intended to confer on any Person other than the Sellers and Buyer and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, or the Parties' respective
related Indemnified Parties hereunder, any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement; provided that only Buyer and
its respective successors and permitted assigns or Seller's Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers and their respective successors and permitted assigns)
will have the right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement on its own
behalf or on behalf of any of its related Indemnified Parties (but shall not
be obligated to do so). The rights and liabilities of Sellers in connection
with this Agreement are, for the avoidance of doubt, several and not joint in
all respects. 

15.12 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended only by an instrument in
writing executed by Buyer and, subject to the limitations on such authority
set forth in Section 15.7, Seller's Representative on behalf of Sellers.

15.13 Waiver; Rights Cumulative. Any of the terms, covenants, representations,
warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by a written instrument
executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving compliance. No course of dealing
on the part of Sellers or Buyer, or their respective officers, employees,
agents or representatives or any failure by Sellers or Buyer to exercise any
of its rights under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof or affect
in any way the right of such Person at a later time to enforce the performance
of such provision. No waiver by Sellers or Buyer of any condition or any
breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as
a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach or a waiver of
any other condition or of any breach of any other term, covenant,
representation or warranty. The rights of Sellers and Buyer under this
Agreement shall be cumulative, and the exercise or partial exercise of any
such right shall not preclude the exercise of any other right.

15.14 Conflict of Law Jurisdiction, Venue; Jury Waiver.

(a)THIS AGREEMENT AND THE LEGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS
WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE
APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.

(b)THE PARTIES AND SELLER'S REPRESENTATIVE HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
LOCATED IN TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS (OR, IF REQUIREMENTS FOR FEDERAL JURISDICTION
ARE NOT MET, STATE COURTS LOCATED IN TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS) AND APPROPRIATE
APPELLATE COURTS THEREFROM FOR THE RESOLUTION OF ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, OR
CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR IN RELATION TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND EACH OF THE PARTIES AND SELLER'S REPRESENTATIVE
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL ACTIONS, SUITS AND PROCEEDINGS IN RESPECT
OF SUCH DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH
COURTS. EACH OF THE PARTIES AND SELLER'S REPRESENTATIVE HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, (i) ANY OBJECTION
IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH ACTION, SUIT
OR PROCEEDING IN ANY OF THE AFORESAID COURTS, (ii) ANY CLAIM IT MAY NOW OR
HEREAFTER HAVE THAT ANY SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN
INCONVENIENT FORUM, AND (iii) THE RIGHT TO OBJECT, IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH
ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, THAT ANY SUCH COURT DOES NOT HAVE ANY JURISDICTION
OVER SUCH PERSON. EACH OF THE PARTIES AND SELLER'S REPRESENTATIVE HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF ANY PAPERS, NOTICES OR PROCESS AT THE
ADDRESS SET OUT IN SECTION 15.6 IN 

CONNECTION WITH ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING AND AGREES THAT NOTHING HEREIN
WILL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF THE OTHER PARTIES TO SERVE ANY SUCH PAPERS, NOTICES
OR PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EACH OF THE
PARTIES AND SELLER'S REPRESENTATIVE AGREES THAT A JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH
DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT
ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

(c)EACH OF THE PARTIES AND SELLER'S REPRESENTATIVE WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

15.15 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
adverse manner to any of Sellers or Buyer. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
Buyer and the Seller's Representative shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely
as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

15.16 Like-Kind Exchange. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement,
each Party shall have the right to structure the transactions contemplated
under the terms of this Agreement as a Like-Kind Exchange. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Agreement, in connection with effectuating a Like-
Kind Exchange, each Party shall have the right, at or prior to the Closing
Date or any subsequent closing, to assign all or a portion of its rights under
this Agreement (the "Assigned Rights") to a "qualified intermediary" (as that
term is defined in Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) of the Treasury Regulations) or
to an "Exchange Accommodation Titleholder" (as that term is defined in U.S.
Revenue Procedure 2000-37). In the event a Party (in its capacity as an
exchanging party, referred to in this Section 15.16 as an "Exchanging Party")
assigns the Assigned Rights to a "qualified intermediary" pursuant to this
Section 15.16, then such Exchanging Party agrees to notify the other Party in
writing of such assignment reasonably in advance of the Closing Date. In
addition, should a Party choose to effectuate a Like-Kind Exchange, the
Parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with one another in
the completion of such an exchange, including (i) the execution of all
documents reasonably necessary to effectuate such a Like-Kind Exchange and
(ii) having the "qualified intermediary" fund an amount equal to the Deposit
at Closing to the escrow account and having the original funds deposited by
Buyer on the Execution Date as the Deposit (including any interest and
earnings thereon) in the escrow account distributed to Buyer; provided,
however, that (a) the Closing Date shall not be delayed or affected by reason
of the Like-Kind Exchange, (b) the Exchanging Party shall effect its Exchange
through an assignment of the Assigned Rights to a "qualified intermediary" or
to an "Exchange Accommodation Titleholder," but such assignment shall not
release such Exchanging Party from any of its liabilities or obligations under
this Agreement and (c) the non-Exchanging Party shall incur no additional
unreimbursed costs, 

expenses, fees or liabilities as a result of or in connection with the
exchange requested by the Exchanging Party. Sellers and Buyer each hereby
acknowledge and agree that any assignment of this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 15.16 shall not release a Party from, or modify, any of its respective
liabilities and obligations (including indemnity obligations to each other)
under this Agreement. Neither Sellers nor Buyer, by its consent to a Like-Kind
Exchange, shall be responsible in any way for the Exchanging Party's
compliance with such Like-Kind Exchange.

15.17 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an
original instrument, but all of such counterparts shall constitute for all
purposes one agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by any
Party may be evidenced by facsimile or other electronic transmission
(including scanned documents delivered by email), which shall be binding upon
all Parties.

15.18 Waiver of Preferential Purchase Rights and Consents. Each Seller hereby
irrevocably (a) waives any Preferential Purchase Rights it may have that are
applicable to the Assets, the transactions contemplated hereunder, and (b)
grants any applicable consents to assignment pertaining to the Assets or the
transactions contemplated hereunder.
