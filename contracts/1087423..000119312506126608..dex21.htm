Merger, which Merger will be followed, as soon as reasonably practicable, by a merger of the Surviving Corporation (as defined below) with and into Merger LLC (the &#147;<U>Upstream Merger</U>&#148;). It is intended that the Merger be mutually
interdependent with and a condition precedent to the Upstream Merger and that the Upstream Merger shall, through the binding commitment evidenced by Section&nbsp;4.17, be effected as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (as defined
below) without further approval, authorization or direction from or by any of the parties hereto. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">B. The Company Board has unanimously
