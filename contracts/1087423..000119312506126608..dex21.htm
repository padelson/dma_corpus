-iv- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ "), is made and entered
into as of April 7, 2006 (the " _Agreement Date_ "), by and among Red Hat,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), DaVinci-Matterhorn, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_
"), Matterhorn-DaVinci, LLC, a single member Delaware limited liability
company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger LLC_ "), JBoss,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and Sacha Labourey,
an individual, solely for the purpose of acknowledging his appointment as the
Stockholder Representative pursuant to Section 6.6.

RECITALS

A. Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC and the Company intend to effect a merger
(the " _Merger_ ") of the Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance
with this Agreement and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the " _DGCL_ "), with the Company to be the surviving corporation of
the Merger, which Merger will be followed, as soon as reasonably practicable,
by a merger of the Surviving Corporation (as defined below) with and into
Merger LLC (the " _Upstream Merger_ "). It is intended that the Merger be
mutually interdependent with and a condition precedent to the Upstream Merger
and that the Upstream Merger shall, through the binding commitment evidenced
by Section 4.17, be effected as soon as practicable following the Effective
Time (as defined below) without further approval, authorization or direction
from or by any of the parties hereto.

B. The Company Board has unanimously (i) determined that the Merger is fair
to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the Stockholders, (ii)
approved this Agreement, the Merger, the Escrow Agreement and the other
Transactions (excluding the Upstream Merger) and (iii) recommended that the
Stockholders adopt and approve this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and
approve the Merger.

C. The Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have determined that it
is in the best interests of their respective companies and stockholders to
consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

D. For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger and the
Upstream Merger, considered together as a single integrated transaction
for United States federal income tax purposes, shall qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.

E. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a
condition and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement,
certain Stockholders have entered into Stockholder Agreements, dated as of
the Agreement Date, pursuant to which such Stockholders have agreed to vote
in favor of, or consent in writing to, the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the approval of the Merger. The parties intend that, as soon as
practicable following the execution of this Agreement, certain Stockholders
will execute written consents approving the Charter Amendment, this Agreement
and the Merger. AGREEMENT

In consideration of the covenants, promises and representations set forth
herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the provisions of the DGCL, Merger Sub shall
be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The surviving
corporation after the Merger is sometimes referred to herein as the "
_Surviving Corporation_."

1.2 _Effective Time_. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to
Section 7.1, the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the " _Closing_ ") will take place, unless another place or date is agreed to
by Parent and the Company, at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and
Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts, as promptly as practicable,
but no later than three Business Days, following the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article V (other than conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions), _provided_ , that in the event that the conditions
set forth in Article V (other than conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions) are satisfied on or after the 15th day of a calendar month, the
Closing will take place on the last Business Day of such calendar month. The
date upon which the Closing occurs is herein referred to as the " _Closing
Date_." On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a properly executed Certificate of Merger satisfying the
requirements of the DGCL in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the time of
acceptance by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of such filing
being referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all rights and property of the Company and Merger Sub
shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts and liabilities of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become debts and liabilities of the Surviving
Corporation.

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

(a) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the
Effective Time the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated in its entirety as set forth in the Certificate
of Merger until thereafter amended as provided by applicable Law and such
Certificate of Incorporation.



 

-2- (b) At the Effective Time, the By-Laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be amended to change all references to the
name of the Merger Sub to refer to the name of the Surviving Corporation, and,
as so amended, such By-Laws shall be the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended.

1.5 _Directors and Officers_. At the Effective Time and by virtue of the
Merger, the director(s) of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall become the director(s) of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office
in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, the
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become
the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance
with the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation.

1.6 _Merger Consideration; Effect on Capital Shares; Escrow_.

(a) _Allocation Certificate_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver
to Parent a certificate (the " _Allocation Certificate_ ") of the Company
signed by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the
Company certifying, in each case as of the Closing, (A) the identity of each
record holder of Company Common Shares (other than Company Restricted Stock)
and the number of Company Common Shares held by each such Stockholder; (B)
the identity of each record holder of Company Preferred Shares and the number
of Company Preferred Shares held by each such Stockholder; (C) the identity of
each record holder of a Participating Stock Right, the number and type of
Company Capital Shares covered by such Participating Stock Rights held by such
holder, the exercise prices and vesting schedules thereof, the number and type
of Company Capital Shares subject to each such Participating Stock Right that
will be exercisable as of the Closing, and whether such Participating Stock
Right is intended to be qualified as an "incentive stock option" under Section
422 of the Code; (D) the identity of each record holder of Company
Restricted Stock, the number of Company Common Shares held by such
Stockholder and the vesting schedules thereof; (E) the address of record of
each holder of Company Capital Shares, each holder of Participating Stock
Rights and each holder of Company Restricted Stock; (F) the Merger
Consideration and Escrow Amount allocable to each such holder; and (G) the
amounts required to be deducted and withheld (other than in respect of backup
withholding) from the consideration otherwise payable to each such holder
with respect to the payments or any other Tax withholding obligation in
respect of the Merger or the exercise or settlement of any Company Stock Right
or the vesting of restricted stock under the Code or any other Tax Law,
which Allocation Certificate when approved by Parent shall be deemed the
definitive allocation of Merger Consideration among the Participating Holders
in accordance with the Merger and the disbursements thereof, including with
respect to the Escrow Amount. In the event of a Closing Indebtedness Payment
or that Parent elects to pay cash in lieu of shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with Section 1.6, in completing the Allocation Certificate the
parties may, by mutual written agreement, make adjustments in the Allocation
Certificate to the extent necessary to achieve the intent of the conversion
formulas set forth in this Section 1.6.



 

-3- (b) _Merger Consideration_. Subject to Section 1.6(c), the aggregate
consideration to be paid by Parent to the Participating Holders in connection
with the Merger (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") shall be payable in cash and
in shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, of Parent (" _Parent
Common Stock_ ") as set forth in this Section 1.6. The Merger Consideration
is subject to adjustment after the Closing as set forth in this Agreement.

(c) _Escrow_. At the Closing, Parent, on behalf of the Participating Holders
on a Pro Rata Basis, shall deposit with American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), cash in the amount of $43.0 million. The
Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the
escrow agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ (the " _Escrow
Agreement_ ") and shall be released in accordance with the terms thereof. The
parties to this Agreement intend that all cash payments of the Merger
Consideration that are treated under the Code as payments in exchange for
Company Capital Shares (and not as compensation), including the portion of the
Escrow Amount and the contingent consideration described in Section 1.10 so
treated, shall qualify for installment sale treatment under Section 453 of the
Code, and the provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance
with such intention. 

(d) _Effect on Company Capital Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Merger
LLC, the Company or the Stockholders:

(i) Each Company Common Share held in the treasury of the Company and
each Company Common Share owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof, and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto;
and

(ii) Each Company Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive, upon
surrender of the Certificate therefor and a Letter of Transmittal with respect
thereto in accordance with this Agreement and subject to Section 1.6(c), the
Per Share Preferred Consideration; _provided_ that, subject to Section
1.6(g), Parent shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to pay to any
holder of Company Preferred Shares that does not deliver, at least three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a completed Accredited Investor
Questionnaire demonstrating, in the sole judgment of Parent, that such holder
is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Regulation D under the
Securities Act, in lieu of the shares of Parent Common Stock included in the
Per Share Preferred Consideration, an amount in cash, for each such share of
Parent Common Stock, equal to the Parent Average Closing Price; _provided_
_further_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the amount of cash that each holder of Company Preferred Shares shall have the
right to receive in respect of all such shares held by such holder shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the product of (1) the Pro Rata Cash
Reduction Percentage in respect of such holder multiplied by (2) the Closing
Indebtedness Payment; and _provided_ _further_ that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, (x) the amount of cash that each holder
of Company Preferred Shares (other than a holder of Company Preferred Shares
entitled to receive, after the exercise of Parents right under the first
proviso of this clause (ii), Merger Consideration consisting solely of cash in
respect of the  



 

-4-  Company Preferred Shares held by such holder), shall have the right to
receive in respect of all such shares held by such holder shall be reduced by
an amount equal to the product of (1) the Pro Rata Securities Payment
Percentage in respect of such holder multiplied by (2) the Securities Payment
and (y) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that each such holder of
Company Preferred Shares shall have the right to receive in respect of all
such shares held by such holder shall be increased by an amount equal to the
product of (1) the Pro Rata Securities Payment Percentage in respect of such
holder multiplied by (2) the quotient of (I) the Securities Payment divided
by (II) the Parent Average Closing Price.

(iii) Each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than any Company Common Shares to be canceled
pursuant to Section 1.6(d)(i) and any Company Restricted Stock) shall be
converted into the right to receive, upon surrender of the Certificate
therefor and a Letter of Transmittal with respect thereto in accordance with
this Agreement and subject to Section 1.6(c), (A) the Per Share Common
Consideration, (B) subject to Section 1.10, the Per Share Year 1 Earn-Out,
(C) subject to Section 1.10, the Per Share Year 2 Earn-Out and (D) subject to
Section 1.10, the Per Share Stretch Earn-Out; _provided_ that, subject to
Section 1.6(g), Parent shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to pay
to any holder of Company Common Shares that does not deliver, at least three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a completed Accredited Investor
Questionnaire demonstrating, in the sole judgment of Parent, that such holder
is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Regulation D under the
Securities Act, in lieu of all or a portion of the shares of Parent Common
Stock included in the consideration to be received by such holder, an amount
in cash, for each such share of Parent Common Stock, equal to the Parent
Average Closing Price or, in the case of shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable as the Per Share Year 1 Earn-Out, the Per Share Year 2 Earn-Out or
the Per Share Stretch Earn-Out (such number of shares of Parent Common Stock
to be determined in accordance with Section 1.10 and such defined terms based
on the Parent Average Closing Price), equal to the average of the closing
prices of Parent Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ National Market for
the twenty (20) consecutive trading days up to and including the trading day
that is two (2) trading days prior to the date of payment; _provided_
_further_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the amount of cash that each holder of Company Common Shares shall have the
right to receive in respect of all such shares held by such holder shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the product of (1) the Pro Rata Cash Reduction
Percentage in respect of such holder multiplied by (2) the Closing
Indebtedness Payment; and _provided_ _further_ that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, (x) the amount of cash that each holder of
Company Common Shares (other than a holder of Company Common Shares entitled
to receive, after the exercise of Parents right under the first proviso of
this clause (iii), Merger Consideration consisting solely of cash in respect
of the Company Common Shares held by such holder), shall have the right to
receive in respect of all such shares held by such holder shall be reduced by
an amount equal to the product of (1) the Pro Rata Securities Payment
Percentage in respect of such holder multiplied by (2) the Securities Payment
and (y) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that each such holder of
Company Common Shares shall have the right to receive in respect of all such
shares held by such holder shall be increased by an amount equal to the
product of (1) the Pro Rata Securities Payment Percentage in respect of such
holder multiplied by (2) the quotient of (I) the Securities Payment divided by
(II) the Parent Average Closing Price; and



 

-5- (iv) Each share of Company Restricted Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive,
upon surrender of the Certificate therefor and a Letter of Transmittal with
respect thereto in accordance with this Agreement, a corresponding number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (" _Parent Restricted Stock_ ") under the
Company Equity Incentive Plan to be assumed by Parent, which number of shares
of Parent Restricted Stock shall be equal to the quotient of (A) the Per Share
Unvested Option Consideration  _divided by_ (B) the Parent Average Closing
Price; _provided_ that, subject to Section 1.6(g), Parent shall have the
right, in its sole discretion, to pay to any holder of Company Restricted
Stock that does not deliver, at least three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, a completed Accredited Investor Questionnaire demonstrating, in
the sole judgment of Parent, that such holder is an "accredited investor"
within the meaning of Regulation D under the Securities Act, in lieu of all
or a portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock included in the
consideration to be received by such holder, an amount in cash, for each such
share of Parent Common Stock, equal to the Parent Average Closing Price; 
_provided_ _further_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the corresponding number of shares of Parent Restricted Stock that
each share of Company Restricted Stock shall be converted into shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the Per Share Unvested Option Deduction or, in
the event that Parent shall exercise its right pursuant to the immediately
preceding proviso to pay cash to such holder in lieu of shares of Parent
Common Stock, the amount of cash payable in respect of each share of Parent
Common Stock shall be reduced by an amount equal to the product of (1) the Per
Share Unvested Option Deduction and (2) the Parent Average Closing Price.
Except as otherwise provided in the applicable stock restriction agreement,
no additional acceleration of the vesting of the Company Restricted Stock
shall take place as a result of the consummation of the Merger, and the
vesting terms of the Parent Restricted Stock shall be identical to the
vesting terms of the Company Restricted Stock. The shares of Parent Restricted
Stock issued in respect of such shares of Company Restricted Stock will be
subject to the same vesting and other purchase, repurchase and redemption
restrictions to which such shares of Company Restricted Stock are subject,
and the certificates representing shares of Parent Restricted Stock may
accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. In all other respects, the
Parent Restricted Stock will be governed by the terms of the Company Equity
Incentive Plan to be assumed by Parent and the applicable restricted stock
agreement. Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days thereafter, Parent will mail to such holder, at the record
address provided by the Company, a notice describing the conversion described
herein.

(e) _Company Stock Rights_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC, the
Company, the Stockholders or the holders of Company Stock Rights, the
following will occur:

(i) Each Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that is not then vested or will not vest upon the completion of the
Merger (each, an " _Unvested Company Option_ ") and the Company Equity
Incentive Plan will be assumed by Parent. Immediately after the Effective
Time, each Unvested Company Option shall be deemed to constitute an option (a
" _Parent Option_ ") to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time (except as set forth in this sentence), such number of shares of Parent
Common Stock as is equal to the product of (1) the quotient of (x) the Per
Share Unvested Option Consideration _divided by_ (y) the  



 

-6-  Parent Average Closing Price _multiplied by_ (2) the number of Company
Common Shares subject to the corresponding Unvested Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Parent Option shall be reduced
by a number of shares equal to the product of (x) the Per Share Unvested
Option Deduction  _multiplied by_ (y) the total number of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to such Parent Option after giving effect to this Section
1.6(e)(i) (other than this proviso). The per share exercise price of any such
Parent Option shall be equal to the product of (1) the quotient of (x) the
Parent Average Closing Price _divided by_ (y) the Per Share Unvested Option
Consideration _multiplied by_ (2) the per share exercise price of the
corresponding Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ that if the number of shares subject to such Parent Option is
decreased pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, then the per share
exercise price of each Parent Option shall be increased so that it is equal
to the product of (x) the quotient of (I) the total number of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to such Parent Option after giving effect to this Section
1.6(e)(i) (other than the immediately preceding proviso) _divided by_ (II)
the total number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Parent
Option after giving effect to this Section 1.6(e)(i) (including the
immediately preceding proviso) _multiplied by_ (y) the exercise price for
such Parent Option calculated in accordance with this sentence (prior to
giving effect to this proviso). Except as otherwise provided in the individual
grant agreements related to the Unvested Company Options, (i) no acceleration
of the vesting of the Unvested Company Options shall take place as a result of
the consummation of the Merger, and (ii) the vesting terms and the expiration
dates of the Parent Options shall be identical to the vesting terms and
expiration dates of the Company Options. Reasonably promptly after the
Effective Time, and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days, the shares
of Parent Common Stock subject to Parent Options will be covered by
a registration statement under the Securities Act. Promptly after the
Effective Time, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days thereafter,
Parent will mail to each holder of an Unvested Company Option, at the record
address provided by the Company, a notice describing the assumption of such
Unvested Company Option hereunder.

(ii) Each Company Option that is not an Unvested Company Option (each, a "
_Vested Company Option"_ ), to the extent unexercised as of the Effective
Time, shall thereafter no longer be exercisable but shall be converted into
the right to receive, upon surrender of the option agreement therefor (or
agreement from the holder that such Vested Company Option shall represent only
the right to receive the consideration described in this Section 1.6(e)(ii))
and subject to Section 1.6(g), (A) the Per Share Vested Option Consideration,
(B) subject to Section 1.10, the Per Share Year 1 Earn-Out, (C) subject to
Section 1.10, the Per Share Year 2 Earn-Out and (D) subject to Section 1.10,
the Per Share Stretch Earn-Out, in the case of clauses (B), (C) and (D), at
the same time, in the same manner and subject to the same conditions under
which the holders of Company Common Stock receive shares of Parent Common
Stock and cash pursuant to Section 1.10; _provided_  that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the amount of cash that each
holder of a Vested Company Option shall have the right to receive in respect
of such option held by such holder shall be reduced by an amount equal to
the product of (1) the Pro Rata Cash Reduction Percentage in respect of such
holder multiplied by (2) the Closing Indebtedness Payment; and _provided_
_further_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (x) the amount of cash that each holder of a Vested Company Option
shall have the right to receive in respect of all such options held by such
holder shall be reduced by an amount equal to the product of (1) the Pro Rata
Securities Payment  



 

-7-  Percentage in respect of such holder multiplied by (2) the Securities
Payment and (y) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that each
such holder of a Vested Company Option shall have the right to receive in
respect of all such options held by such holder shall be increased by an
amount equal to the product of (1) the Pro Rata Securities Payment Percentage
in respect of such holder multiplied by (2) the quotient of (I) the
Securities Payment divided by (II) the Parent Average Closing Price. Promptly
after the Closing, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days thereafter,
Parent shall mail to the Participating Holders of Vested Company Options in
exchange therefor a certificate representing the number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock, if any, and cash constituting the aggregate Per Share
Vested Option Consideration to which such Participating Holder is entitled
pursuant to this Section 1.6(e)(ii) (less the cash proceeds to be deposited
with the Escrow Agent on such Participating Holders behalf pursuant to
Section 1.6(c) and any applicable withholding Taxes) and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares as provided in Section 1.6(h).

(iii) Each Company Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be canceled and converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive, upon surrender of the warrant agreement or instrument therefor (or
agreement from the holder that such Company Warrant shall represent only the
right to receive the consideration described in this Section 1.6(e)(iii)) and
a Letter of Transmittal with respect thereto and subject to Section 1.6(c),
(1) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the amount by which (A)
the product of (x) the number of Company Preferred Shares subject to such
Company Warrant and (y) the quotient of (i) 40% of the Preferred Consideration
_divided by_ (ii) the total number of Company Preferred Shares issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming the
issuance of all Company Preferred Shares issuable upon conversion or exercise
of Company Stock Rights), _exceeds_ (B) the product of (x) the number of
Company Preferred Shares subject to such Company Warrant and (y) the exercise
price of such Company Warrant, and (2) such number of shares of Parent Common
Stock as is equal to the product of (A) the number of Company Preferred Shares
subject to such Company Warrant and (B) the quotient of (x) the Per Share
Preferred Stock Value _divided by_ (y) the total number of Company Preferred
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(assuming the issuance of all Company Preferred Shares issuable upon
conversion or exercise of Company Stock Rights); _provided_ that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the amount of cash
that each holder of a Company Warrant shall have the right to receive in
respect of such warrant shall be reduced by an amount equal to the product of
(1) the Pro Rata Cash Reduction Percentage in respect of such holder
multiplied by (2) the Closing Indebtedness Payment; and _provided_  
_further_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
(x) the amount of cash that each holder of a Company Warrant shall have the
right to receive in respect of all such warrants held by such holder shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the product of (1) the Pro Rata Securities
Payment Percentage multiplied by (2) the Securities Payment and (y) the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock that each such holder of a Company Warrant
shall have the right to receive in respect of all such warrants held by such
holder shall be increased by an amount equal to the product of (1) Pro Rata
Securities Payment Percentage multiplied by (2) the quotient of (I) the
Securities Payment divided by (II) the Parent Average Closing Price.

(f) _NASDAQ Matters_. In the event that the issuance of shares of Parent
Common Stock hereunder would require the approval of the stockholders of
Parent under Rule 4350(i)(1) of the Marketplace Rules of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Parent  



 

-8-  shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to pay to any holder of
Company Capital Shares, any holder of a Company Warrant and any holder of a
Vested Company Option, in lieu of any shares of Parent Common Stock payable
to such holder under this Section 1.6, an amount in cash, for each share of
Parent Common Stock, equal to the Parent Average Closing Price or, in the case
of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable as the Per Share Year 1 Earn-Out,
the Per Share Year 2 Earn-Out or the Per Share Stretch Earn-Out (such number
of shares of Parent Common Stock to be determined in accordance with Section
1.10 and such defined terms based on the Parent Average Closing Price), equal
to the average of the closing prices of Parent Common Stock as reported on the
NASDAQ National Market for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days up to and
including the trading day that is two (2) trading days prior to the date of
payment. In the event that Parent determines to pay cash in lieu of shares of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with this Section 1.6(f), Parent shall
provide written notice to the Company at least one (1) Business Day prior to
the Closing Date.

(g) _Unaccredited Holders_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Parent shall not have the right to pay cash in lieu of
Parent Common Stock to any holder of Company Preferred Shares, Company Common
Shares or Company Restricted Stock in accordance with the first provisos
included in Sections 1.6(d)(ii), 1.6(d)(iii) and 1.6(d)(iv) above unless more
than thirty (30) Participating Holders fail to furnish a completed Accredited
Investor Questionnaire to Parent, at least three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, demonstrating, in the sole judgment of Parent, that they
are an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. If there are more than thirty (30) such Participating Holders,
Parent shall not exercise its right to pay cash in lieu of Parent Common
Stock with respect to the thirty (30) of such holders who are otherwise
entitled to receive the greatest number of shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with Section 1.6. In the event that Parent determines to pay cash
in lieu of shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with the first provisos
included in Sections 1.6(d)(ii), 1.6(d)(iii) and 1.6(d)(iv), Parent shall
provide written notice to the Company at least one (1) Business Day prior to
the Closing Date.

(h) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued on the surrender for exchange
of Certificates, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each
Participating Holder entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to this Section 1.6 that would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into
account all Company Capital Shares, Company Warrants and Company Options held
by such Participating Holder) shall, upon surrender of such Participating
Holders Certificates or the cancellation of such Participating Holders
Company Options or Company Warrants, as the case may be, receive, in lieu of
a fraction of a share, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock,
_multiplied by_ (ii) the Parent Average Closing Price.

(i) _Withholding Rights; Deductions from Consideration._ Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any payment to any Person under this Agreement or any other Transaction
Agreements (i) such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment or any other Tax withholding  



 

-9-  obligation with respect to the Merger, the Upstream Merger or any other
Transaction or the exercise or settlement of any Company Stock Right or the
vesting of restricted stock under the Code or any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law and (ii) the amount of any outstanding loans (including any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any other amounts in respect thereof)
owed by such Person to the Company as of the Closing. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld or deducted by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange
Agent, Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

(j) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Shares_. The amounts paid
or payable upon the surrender for exchange of Company Capital Shares in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Capital Shares, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of Company Capital Shares which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

(k) _Capital Shares of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock
certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall
continue to evidence ownership of such shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(l) _Adjustments to Parent Common Stock_. The number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable as contingent consideration under Section 1.10
shall be subject to equitable adjustment in the event of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares
or other similar change in capitalization or event occurring after the
Effective Time.

(m) _Savings Clause_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, in no event shall the aggregate consideration payable by Parent
to the Participating Holders hereunder exceed the sum of (1) $421.0 million
_plus_ (2) the aggregate exercise price of all Unvested Company Options
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time _plus_ (3) the
Closing Working Capital Surplus, if any, _less_ (4) the Closing Working
Capital Shortfall, if any, _less_ (5) the amount of Closing Indebtedness
Payment (assuming for this purpose that the value of each share of Parent
Common Stock issuable hereunder to the Participating Holders is the Parent
Average Closing Price), and this Agreement shall be interpreted accordingly. 

1.7 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
Company Capital Shares held by a Stockholder who demands and perfects
appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with the DGCL and who, as of
the Effective Time, has not effectively  



 

-10-  withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights (any such shares being referred to
as " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to
such shares), shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive
any portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6, but
the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by
the DGCL.

(b) If any Stockholder who holds Dissenting Shares as of the Effective Time
effectively withdraws or loses (through passage of time, failure to demand or
perfect, or otherwise) the right to demand and perfect appraisal rights under
the DGCL, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of
such event, such holders shares that were Dissenting Shares shall
automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive a
portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to and subject to Section 1.6
without interest thereon upon surrender of the certificate therefor and a
Letter of Transmittal with respect thereto in accordance with this Agreement.

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any demands
for appraisal of any Company Capital Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and
any other instruments or notices served pursuant to the DGCL on the Company or
that otherwise relate to such demands received by the Company, and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal under the DGCL, or offer to settle any
such matters.

1.8 _Surrender of Certificates and Company Warrants_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
Mellon Investor Services, LLC or, if not Mellon Investor Services, LLC, then a
United States bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")
in the Merger. On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent for exchange in accordance with this Section 1.8 certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable and cash included in
the Merger Consideration payable at the Closing pursuant to Section 1.6 in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Capital Shares and Participating
Stock Rights (other than holders of Vested Company Options); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, on behalf of the Participating Holders, Parent shall
deposit the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 1.6(c) and
the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Agreement Date and in any event not less than five (5) Business Days before
the Closing Date, Parent will deliver to the Company for distribution to each
Participating Holder (other than holders of Vested Company Options) (i) a
letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") which shall specify
that delivery of the Certificates and Company Warrants held by such
Participating Holder shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such
Certificates and Company Warrants shall pass, only upon delivery of such
original Certificates and Company Warrants to the Exchange Agent and shall be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify,
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and
Company Warrants held by such Participating Holder in exchange for
certificates representing  



 

-11-  shares of Parent Common Stock and the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration payable therefor and (iii) an Accredited Investor Questionnaire.
The Letter of Transmittal shall indicate that applicable withholding Taxes
with respect to the vesting of Company Restricted Stock will be withheld from
the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to each Participating Holder who
receives a payment upon the conversion of Company Restricted Stock, and that
other amounts may be withheld from any such Participating Holder in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. If a Participating Holder delivers to the
Exchange Agent a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal and a duly
completed and executed Accredited Investor Questionnaire, together with the
surrender of the Certificates and Company Warrants held by such Participating
Holder for cancellation, on the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent shall
transmit to such Participating Holder promptly after the Closing Date, and in
any event within four (4) Business Days after the Closing Date, in exchange
therefor, a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock and cash constituting the aggregate Per Share Preferred
Consideration or Per Share Common Consideration, as the case may be, to which
such Participating Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6 (less the cash
proceeds to be deposited with the Escrow Agent on such Participating Holders
behalf pursuant to Section 1.6(c))) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
as provided in Section 1.6(h), and the Certificates and Company Warrants so
surrendered shall be canceled. Otherwise, the applicable Merger Consideration
shall be transmitted by the Exchange Agent to the holder of such Certificates
and Company Warrants as promptly as practicable, and in any event within four
(4) Business Days following the surrender of the Certificates and Company
Warrants held by such Participating Holder, a duly completed and executed
Letter of Transmittal with respect thereto and a duly completed and executed
Accredited Investor Questionnaire. Any payment of cash to a Participating
Holder hereunder shall be so made by (i) wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such account as may be designated by such Participating
Holder, if such payment to be made to such Participating Holder is equal to
or greater than $1,000,000, or (ii) by check, if such payment is less than
$1,000,000. Following the Effective Time, until so surrendered, each
outstanding Certificate and Company Warrant that, prior to the Effective
Time, represented Company Capital Shares or the right to purchase Company
Capital Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all
purposes, to evidence only the right to receive that portion of Merger
Consideration to which such Participating Holder is entitled in accordance
with this Article I.

(c) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in exchange therefor until the holder of record of
such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this
Section 1.8. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. No interest
shall be payable on any cash deliverable upon the exchange of any Company
Capital Stock for cash.

(d) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.8, none of the Exchange Agent, the Parent, the Merger LLC, the Surviving
Corporation or any  



 

-12-  other party hereto shall be liable for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Certificate or Company Warrant shall not have been surrendered
prior to one year after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which any Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares or any dividends or distributions payable to the holder of such
Certificate or Company Warrant pursuant to this Article I would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger
Consideration or cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Certificate or Company Warrant shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates or Company Warrants_. In the event
any Certificates or Company Warrants to be surrendered in accordance with
Section 1.8(b) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall deem
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates or Company Warrants surrendered
for purposes of Section 1.8(b), upon the receipt of an affidavit of that fact,
in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, by the holder thereof pursuant
to which such holder would agree to indemnify Parent and its Affiliates
against any claim that may be made against Parent or its Affiliates with
respect to the Certificates or Company Warrants alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Agent Fund_. Any portion of the consideration
held by the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 1.8 which remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Capital Shares and Participating Stock
Rights for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Company Capital Shares or
Participating Stock Rights who has not previously complied with this Section
1.8 shall thereafter look only to Parent, as a general unsecured creditor, for
payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect
to Parent Common Stock.

1.9 _Working Capital Adjustment_.

(a) The Company shall, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, deliver to Parent a certificate, signed by the Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, setting forth a good faith
determination of the estimated Closing Net Working Capital, determined in
accordance with GAAP on a consistent basis with the Company Financial
Statements and past practice to the extent not inconsistent with GAAP (the "
_Estimated Net Working Capital_ ").



 

-13- (b) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Closing Current Assets_ " means the current assets of the Company, as
of the close of business on the Closing Date, as determined in accordance
with GAAP in effect at the Closing Date, consistently applied, and shall
include, without duplication, (a) cash and cash equivalents, (b) accounts
receivable, net of allowance for bad debt, and (c) other current
assets (including deposits and prepaid rent). Current assets shall not
include (i) current and deferred income taxes, (ii) transaction related assets
(e.g. capitalized legal or advisory fees) and (iii) any prepaid insurance
policies _._  

(ii) " _Closing Net Working Capital_ " shall mean an amount (positive or
negative) equal to the (i) Closing Current Assets _minus_ (ii) Closing Total
Liabilities. Closing Net Working Capital will exclude the impact of FAS 123(R)
and any assets or liabilities relating to any other equity instrument
(including restricted stock and preferred stock). An illustration of the
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, together with a summary of the
assumptions related thereto, is attached as _Schedule 1.9(a)_.

(iii) " _Closing Total Liabilities_ " means the current and long-term
liabilities of the Company, as of the close of business on the Closing Date,
as determined in accordance with GAAP in effect at the Closing Date,

payable, (b) accrued expenses (including payroll, bonuses, commissions, rent,
utilities, etc.), (c) obligations or amounts payable for acquisitions of
businesses or intellectual property, (d) unpaid obligations or amounts payable
relating to transaction fees and expenses, (e) any tax liabilities, (f) any
items of indebtedness for borrowed money, (g) Estimated Transaction Expenses
and (h) any other long-term liabilities. Closing Total Liabilities shall not
include any items included in the Closing Indebtedness Payment. For the
avoidance of doubt, all deferred revenue liabilities (current and long-term
portions) of the Company will be included when calculating Closing Net Working
Capital.

(iv) " _December Current Assets_ " shall mean the current assets of the
Company as determined in accordance with GAAP in effect at December 31, 2005,
consistently applied, and shall include, without duplication, (a) cash and
cash equivalents, (b) accounts receivable, net of allowance for bad debt, and
(c) other current assets (including deposits and prepaid rent). Current assets
shall not include (i) current and deferred income taxes, (ii) transaction
related assets (e.g. capitalized legal or advisory fees) and (iii) prepaid
insurance policies.

(v) " _December Current Liabilities_ " means the current liabilities of the
Company as determined in accordance with GAAP in effect at December 31, 2005,
consistently applied, and shall include, without duplication, (a) accounts
payable and (b) accrued expenses (including payroll, bonuses, commissions,
rent, utilities, etc.), and shall not include (i) any items relating to
indebtedness for borrowed money, (ii) any amounts payable for acquisitions of
businesses or intellectual property (other than payments for the acquisition
of Hibernate) _,_ (iii) accrued obligations relating to any transaction (e.g.
legal or advisory fees relating to mergers) and (iv) any obligation in respect
of income taxes _._ For the avoidance of doubt, all deferred revenue
liabilities (current and long-term portions) of the Company will be included
as current liabilities when calculating December Net Working Capital and
Estimated Transaction Expenses shall not be included when calculating December
Net Working Capital.



 

-14- (vi) " _December Net Working Capital_ " shall mean an amount (positive or
negative) equal to the (i) December Current Assets, calculated by reference
to the Companys audited financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2005 _minus_ (ii) the December Current Liabilities, calculated by reference to
the Companys audited financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2005 _minus_ (iii) $500,000. December Net Working Capital will exclude the
impact of FAS 123(R) and any assets or liabilities relating to any other
equity instrument (including restricted stock and preferred stock). An
illustration of the calculation of the December Net Working Capital, together
with a summary of the assumptions related thereto, is attached as _Schedule
1.9(b)_.

(c) The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect the difference, if
any, between the December Net Working Capital and the Closing Net
Working Capital.

(i) As soon as practicable, but in any event within sixty (60) days following
the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the
Stockholder Representative (A) an unaudited balance sheet of the Company (the
" _Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet_ ") as of the close of business on the
Closing Date prepared in accordance with GAAP on a consistent basis with the
Companys audited financial statements at and for the year ended December 31,
2005 and past practice to the extent not inconsistent with GAAP, together with
worksheets and data that support the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet, and
(B) a certificate, signed by the Chief Financial Officer of Parent, certifying
on behalf of Parent that the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet was prepared in
good faith and in accordance with this Section 1.9. Each of Parent and the
surviving entity of the Upstream Merger shall provide the Stockholder
Representative and its accountants reasonable access to the personnel and
books and records of Parent and the surviving entity of the Upstream Merger
that are applicable to the Company Business for the purpose of discussing the
preparation of, and reviewing, the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet.

(ii) Subject to the resolution of any disputes pursuant to this Section
1.9(c), within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final
Closing Date Balance Sheet, (A) if the Estimated Net Working Capital
exceeds the Closing Net Working Capital, calculated by reference to the Final
Closing Date Balance Sheet (such excess, the " _Closing Working Capital
Shortfall_ "), Parent shall be entitled to a payment from the Escrow Amount in
an amount equal to the Closing Working Capital Shortfall, which shall be
treated as a downward adjustment to the Merger Consideration payable to
Participating Holders for tax purposes, and (B) if the Closing Net Working
Capital, calculated by reference to the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet,
exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital (such excess, the " _Closing Working
Capital Surplus_ "), the Participating Holders shall be entitled, subject to
the last sentence of this Section 1.9(c)(ii), to an additional payment from
Parent in an amount equal to the Closing Working Capital Surplus, which shall
be treated as an upward adjustment to the Merger Consideration payable to
Participating Holders for tax purposes. In the event of a Closing Working
Capital Shortfall, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall direct the
Escrow Agent to deliver to Parent from the Escrow Amount, an amount in cash
equal to the Closing Working Capital Shortfall. In the event of a Closing
Working Capital Surplus, Parent  



 

-15-  shall deliver, on behalf of the Participating Holders on a Pro Rata Basis,
to the Escrow Agent, an amount in cash equal to the Closing Working
Capital Surplus, together with instructions that such amount shall be
distributed by the Escrow Agent to the Participating Holders on a Pro Rata
Basis in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and shall not be available for
any indemnification claims pursuant to Article VI hereof.

(iii) The Stockholder Representative may dispute any amounts reflected on the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Stockholder Representative shall have notified Parent in writing of each
disputed item, specifying the amount thereof in dispute and setting forth, in
reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute, within thirty (30) days of the
Stockholder Representatives receipt of the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet.
In the event of such a dispute, Parent and the Stockholder Representative
shall attempt to reconcile their differences. If Parent and the Stockholder
Representative are unable to reach a resolution within twenty (20) days after
receipt by Parent of the Stockholder Representatives written notice of such
dispute, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall submit the items
remaining in dispute for resolution to an independent accounting firm to be
mutually agreed upon by the parties (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "),
which shall, within thirty (30) days of such submission, determine and report
to the Stockholder Representative and Parent upon such remaining disputed
items, and such report shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
Participating Holders, the Stockholder Representative and Parent. The
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet that has not been challenged, has been
reconciled, or has been determined by the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant
to this Section 1.9 is referred to herein as the " _Final Closing Date Balance
Sheet_." The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall
be allocated equally between Parent and the Participating Holders (to be paid
from the Escrow Fund).

1.10 _Earn-Out_.

(a) The Merger Consideration includes the right to receive contingent
consideration, which shall be paid to the Participating Holders (other than
holders of Company Preferred Shares and the holders of Company Warrants), in
the manner described in Section 1.6, and at the times and if, and only if, the
conditions to such contingent payments described in this Section 1.10 are
satisfied.

(b) The Per Share Year 1 Earn-Out shall be paid if, and only if, the Final
Bookings for the year ended December 31, 2006 (" _CY2006_ ") are greater than
$50 million. The Per Share Year 2 Earn-Out shall be paid if, and only if, the
Final Bookings for the year ended December 31, 2007 (" _CY2007_ ") are
greater than $100 million. The Per Share Stretch Earn-Out shall be paid if,
and only if, the Final Bookings for CY2007 are greater than $135 million.

(c) As soon as practicable, but in any event within forty-five (45) days
following the end of each calendar quarter during the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2007, Parent shall determine the
Bookings for such calendar quarter and the year-to-date Bookings as of the end
of such calendar quarter (the " _Quarterly Bookings Report_ "), and
deliver notice of such determinations, together with worksheets and data that
support the Quarterly Bookings Report and summary financial data regarding the
financial performance of the Company Business during such periods, to the
Stockholder Representative.  



 

-16-  Each of Parent and the surviving entity of the Upstream Merger shall provide
the Stockholder Representative with reasonable access to the personnel and
books and records of Parent applicable to the Company Business for the
purpose of discussing the Quarterly Bookings Report and reviewing the same.
The Stockholder Representative may dispute the amount of Bookings for a
calendar quarter reflected in the Quarterly Bookings Report and, except for
the first Quarterly Bookings Report delivered after the Closing Date, not the
amount of year-to-date Bookings reflected in the Quarterly Bookings Report;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Stockholder Representative shall have
notified Parent in writing of each disputed item, specifying the amount
thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for such
dispute, within thirty (30) days of the Stockholder Representatives receipt
of such notice. In the event of such a dispute, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall attempt to reconcile their differences. If Parent and the
Stockholder Representative are unable to reach a resolution within twenty
(20) days after receipt by Parent of the Stockholder Representatives written
notice of dispute, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall submit the
items remaining in dispute for resolution to an independent accounting firm
to be mutually agreed upon by the parties (the " _Earn-Out Accounting Firm_
"), which shall, within thirty (30) days of such submission, determine and
report to the Stockholder Representative and Parent upon such remaining
disputed items, and the determination of Bookings for such period shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the Participating Holders, the Stockholder
Representative and Parent. The determination of Bookings for a period that has
not been challenged, has been reconciled, or has been determined by the Earn-
Out Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 1.10 is referred to herein as the
" _Final Bookings_." The fees and disbursements of the Earn-Out Accounting
Firm shall be allocated equally between Parent and the Participating Holders
(other than the holders of Company Preferred Shares or Company Warrants
therefor) (the portion of such fees and disbursements allocated to the
Participating Holders shall be deducted from the contingent consideration to
be paid to such holders under this Section 1.10).

(d) Subject to the resolution of any disputes pursuant to Section 1.10(c),
the Per Share Year 1 Earn-Out, the Per Share Year 2 Earn-Out and the Per Share
Stretch Earn-Out, as the case may be, shall be paid by Parent in accordance
with Section 1.6 within fifteen (15) days after the date of receipt by the
Stockholder Representative of Parents determination of Bookings for the
applicable period.

(e) Parent shall have the right, in its sole discretion, at any time prior to
January 31, 2008, to make a payment in full of the Per Share Year 1 Earn-Out,
the Per Share Year 2 Earn-Out and the Per Share Stretch Earn-Out, or any
combination of the foregoing. In the event that Parent elects to do so, upon
delivery of the applicable payment in full to the Participating Stockholder
having the right to receive the Per Share Year 1 Earn-Out, the Per Share Year
2 Earn-Out or the Per Share Stretch Earn-Out, as the case may be, Parent
shall have satisfied in full its obligations hereunder in respect of such
contingent consideration.

(f) In the event that a Company Sale occurs prior to the determination of
Final Bookings for CY2006, Parent shall make payment in full (regardless of
the amount of Bookings for CY2006 as of such date) to each Participating
Holder of the Per Share Year 1 Earn-Out, the Per Share Year 2 Earn-Out and
the Per Share Stretch Earn-Out no later than immediately prior to the
effectiveness of such Company Sale. In the event that a Company Sale occurs
following the determination of Final Bookings for CY2006 but before the
determination  



 

-17-  of Final Bookings for CY2007, Parent shall, no later than immediately prior
to the effectiveness of such Company Sale, pay to each Participating
Holder (i) any earned but unpaid amount of the Per Share Year 1 Earn-Out and
(ii) the full amounts of the Per Share Year 2 Earn-Out and Per Share Stretch
Earn-Out (in each case, regardless of the amount of Bookings for CY2007 as of
such date). In the event that a Company Sale occurs following the
determination of Final Bookings for CY 2007, Parent shall, no later than
immediately prior to the effectiveness of such Company Sale, pay to each
Participating Holder any earned but unpaid amount of the Per Share Year 2
Earn-Out and Per Share Stretch Earn-Out. Following payment in full of the Per
Share Year 1 Earn-Out, the Per Share Year 2 Earn-Out and the Per Share Stretch
Earn-Out, as applicable, in accordance with this Section 1.10(f), Parent
shall have satisfied in full its obligations hereunder in respect of such
contingent consideration.

(g) During the period (the " _Earn-Out Period_ ") commencing on the Effective
Time and ending on December 31, 2007 (or such earlier date upon which the Per
Share Year 1 Earn-Out, the Per Share Year 2 Earn-Out and the Per Share Stretch
Earn-Out have been paid in accordance with this Agreement):

(i) Parent shall, at the reasonable direction of Marc Fleury (provided he is
employed by Parent or a subsidiary of Parent) or Robert Bearden (provided he
is employed by Parent or a subsidiary of Parent), hire employees for the
Company Business and terminate the employment of any employee of the Company
Business; provided that such hiring and termination of employment shall be
conducted in accordance with (A) the applicable policies and procedures of
Parent and applicable law and (B) the operating expense budget for the Company
Business set forth in _Schedule 1.10(g)_ , which shall be subject to
adjustment based on the actual Bookings during the Earn-Out Period as follows:
at the conclusion of each calendar quarter the JBoss Management Board (as
defined in clause (iv) below) will review the operating results of the
Company Business and, to the extent Bookings have exceeded the expected
Bookings for such period as set forth in _Schedule 1.10(g)_ , the JBoss
Management Board will determine if an increase in operating expenses is
appropriate (the target increase in operating expenses from the amount set
forth in _Schedule 1.10(g)_ will be 15% of the amount by which Bookings
exceeded the expected Bookings) and to the extent Bookings are equal to or
less than the expected Bookings for such period as set forth in _Schedule
1.10(g)_ , the JBoss Management Board will determine if a decrease in
operating expenses is appropriate (the target decrease in operating expenses
from the amount set forth in _Schedule 1.10(g)_ will be 10% of the amount by
which the Bookings are less than the expected Bookings).

(ii) Parent shall cause (A) the employees of the Company Business primarily
engaged in research and development relating to products and services for the
Company Business to report to Sacha Labourey (provided he is employed by
Parent or a subsidiary of Parent) and (B) the employees of the Company
Business primarily engaged in sales and marketing of products of the Company
Business to report to Robert Bearden (provided he is employed by Parent or a
subsidiary of Parent);

(iii) Parent shall not establish sales incentive compensation for its sales
representatives that is intended to compensate such sales representatives for
sales of Parents products that are competitive with the Company Business
JBoss product during the Earn-Out Period on terms that are more favorable than
the terms on which such sales representatives are compensated for sales of
the Company Business JBoss products and services;



 

-18- (iv) Marc Fleury, Robert Bearden, Sacha Labourey, Charles Peters, Tim Yeaton
(provided, in each case, he is employed by Parent or a subsidiary of Parent)
and a senior technology employee of Parent (to be designated by Parent) shall
meet in person or by telephone conference on a quarterly basis, as the "JBoss
Management Board," to discuss matters related to the Company Business;

(v) Parent shall maintain such books and records with respect to the Company
Business as shall be reasonably necessary to perform its obligations under
this Section 1.10 in all material respects; and

(vi) Subject to Section 1.10(e), Parent shall not sell, exchange or dispose
of any material asset or assets of the Company Business if the effect of such
sale, exchange or disposition would be to materially and adversely impair the
ability of the Company Business to achieve Bookings.

1.11 _Payments at Closing for Indebtedness_. If requested by the Company, as
of the Closing Date and in connection with, and conditioned on, the Closing,
Parent shall provide sufficient funds to the Company to enable the Company to
repay the Companys indebtedness for borrowed money set forth in _Schedule
1.11_ (the " _Closing Indebtedness_ ") at the time of the Closing, provided
that all Liens related to such indebtedness are terminated to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent immediately after payment thereof. If the Company
wishes to request payment of all or a portion of the Closing Indebtedness by
Parent in accordance with the preceding sentence, the Company shall, at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, deliver to Parent a
certificate (the " _Debt Certificate_ "), signed by the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, setting forth an itemized
list of the Closing Indebtedness as of the Closing Date, together with the
balance as of the Closing Date, payoff information and any other information
concerning such Closing Indebtedness as Parent may reasonably request. The
Company hereby directs Parent, in connection with the Closing, to transmit
sufficient funds to the applicable lenders of the Company in respect of the
Closing Indebtedness, as set forth in the Debt Certificate, to satisfy in
full the Companys obligations under the Closing Indebtedness and to release
all Liens related thereto in connection with the Closing (such amount of
funds, the " _Closing Indebtedness Payment_ ").

1.12 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation (and, from
and after the effectiveness of the Upstream Merger, the surviving entity of
the Upstream Merger) with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger
Sub, the officers and directors of the Company and Merger Sub are fully
authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take,
and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.

1.13 _EU Personal Privacy Directive_. No information identifying individual
Employees or consultants or protected personal information regarding such
Employees or consultants will be disclosed in the Data Room or the Disclosure
Schedule in respect of Employees or consultants  



 

-19-  that are employed (or were employed and remain domiciled) in any country
that has enacted legislation implementing the EU Personal Data Privacy
Directive or similar legislation, except to the extent permitted by a

regarding maintenance of privacy of such data in a form reasonably necessary

no Contract for material deduction or material discount has been made with
respect to any Receivable. As of the Agreement Date, neither the Company nor

2.11 _Restrictions on Business Activities_. Except as set forth on _Schedule

injunction, order or decree to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party
or subject or which is otherwise binding upon the Company or any Subsidiary
or any of their property, that has had or would reasonably be expected to have
the effect of prohibiting, impairing or limiting any business or business
practice of the Company or any Subsidiary, any acquisition of property by the
Company or any Subsidiary, the conduct of business by the Company or any
Subsidiary, or otherwise limiting the  



 

-29-  freedom of the Company or any Subsidiary to engage in any line of business

(a) None of the real property used or occupied by the Company or any
Subsidiary, in each case, together with all buildout, fixtures and
improvements created thereon (" _Company Real Property_ "), is owned by the
Company or any Subsidiary, nor has the Company or any Subsidiary ever owned
any real property. All of the Company Real Property is leased or subleased by
the Company or a Subsidiary, or the Company or a Subsidiary has an interest in
such Company Real Property pursuant to a warehousing, license or occupancy
agreement.

(b) _Schedule 2.12(b)_ lists all leases, subleases and other Contracts
pursuant to which the Company and each Subsidiary derives its rights in
the Company Real Property (the " _Leases_ "), including, with respect to each
such Lease, the identity of the landlord or sublandlord, the addresses, the

(c) Each Lease is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms
in all material respects, except as such enforceability may be subject
to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and similar
Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by general
principles of equity. There does not exist under any Lease any material
default by the Company or any Subsidiary or, to the Companys knowledge, by
any other Person, or any event that, with or without notice or lapse of time
or both, would constitute a material default by the Company or any Subsidiary
or, to the Companys knowledge, by any other Person. The Company has made
available to Parent in the Data Room complete copies of all Leases, including
all amendments and Contracts related thereto, and the Leases constitute the
entire agreement between the Company or any Subsidiary and each landlord or
sublandlord with respect to the Company Real Property. All rent and other
charges currently due and payable under the Leases have been paid, except for
liabilities reflected or reserved against in the Company Balance Sheet.

(d) The Company or a Subsidiary is the holder of the tenants interest under
the Leases and has not assigned any of the Leases or subleased all or any
portion of the premises leased thereunder. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has made any material alterations, additions or improvements to the
premises leased under the Leases that are required to be removed at the
termination of the applicable Lease term. The Company or a Subsidiary owns, or
holds leasehold interest in, all trade fixtures, equipment and personal
property located in the premises leased under the Leases and the landlords
thereunder have no Lien thereon or claim thereto, except as may be provided
in the Leases.

operating condition, subject to normal wear and tear, and reasonably fit and
usable for the purposes for which they are being used and (iii) other than

Intellectual Property is either: (i) owned solely by the Company or a
Subsidiary free and clear of any Liens, or (ii) rightfully Used and authorized
for Use by the Company and its Subsidiaries as  



 

-31-  currently Used, as applicable, pursuant to a valid license or other grant of
rights; provided that claims as to infringement shall be covered by  _Section

Property that is Used by the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to a license
or other grant of rights by a third party, other than items required to be
listed in or excepted from listing in either or both of _Schedule 2.14(i)_ and

in the Company Intellectual Property necessary to carry out the Companys and
the Subsidiaries former and current activities.

(c) The Company and each Subsidiary are in compliance with and have not
breached, violated or defaulted under, or received written notice that they
have breached or defaulted under, any of the material terms or conditions of
any license, sublicense or other agreement to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is a party or is otherwise bound relating to any of the Company
Intellectual Property, nor does the Company have knowledge of any event or
occurrence that would reasonably be expected to constitute such a breach or
default (with or without the lapse of time, giving of notice or both). Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default under any agreement listed in
_Schedule 2.14(a)(i)_ ,  _Schedule 2.14(b)_ , _Schedule 2.14(i)_ or _Schedule
2.14(j)_ nor to the knowledge of the Company is any party obligated to the
Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to any such agreement in default

the Transactions does not require consents or approvals under any agreement
listed in _Schedule 2.14(a)(i)_ , _Schedule 2.14(b)_ , _Schedule 2.14(i)_ or
_Schedule 2.14(j)_ in order to preserve the benefits thereunder for the
Surviving Corporation (and the surviving entity in the Upstream Merger) and
does not require the payment of any additional amounts or consideration other
than fees, royalties or payments which the Company or any Subsidiary would
otherwise have been required to pay had the Transactions not occurred. Except
as set forth on _Schedule 2.14(c)_ , neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is
contractually obligated to provide any consideration (whether financial or
otherwise) to any third party, nor is any third party otherwise entitled to
any consideration, with respect to any exercise of contractual rights by the
Company or any Subsidiary in the Company Intellectual Property.

(d) To the Companys knowledge, the Use of the Company Intellectual Property
by the Company or any Subsidiary and the making, using, modifying, offering
for sale, selling, distributing, importing and preparing derivative works of
the Company Products, as previously Used or as currently Used, has not
infringed and does not infringe any other Persons copyright, trade secret
rights, right of privacy, right in personal data, moral right, patent,
trademark, service mark, trade dress, mask work or other intellectual property
right, or give rise to any claim of unfair competition. Except as set forth in
_Schedule 2.14(d)_ , no funds or facilities of any Governmental Entity,
college or university, industry group, standards body or similar Person, were
used in the development of any Company Intellectual Property in a manner that
would cause any Company Intellectual Property to be subject to a compulsory
license or other compulsory grant of rights from the Company or any
Subsidiary. Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.14(d)_ , no claims or demands
(i) challenging the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or ownership by
the Company or any Subsidiary of any of the Company Intellectual Property or
(ii) to the effect that the Use or other exercise of rights in any Company
Intellectual Property by the Company or any Subsidiary or the making,
using, modifying, offering for sale, selling, distributing, importing or
preparing derivative works of the Company Products by the Company or any
Subsidiary or by any licensee of the Company or any Subsidiary, infringes or
will infringe

data, moral right, patent, trademark, service mark, trade dress, mask work
or other intellectual property right of any Person have been asserted in
writing against the Company or any Subsidiary or are threatened by any Person
nor does there exist any valid basis for such a claim or demand. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any licensee
of the Company or any Subsidiary has received any written notice, claim or
demand challenging the Companys compliance with or interpretation of the
Lesser General Public License (" _LGPL_ ") or any other license for Publicly

and complete copies of such assignments.

measures to maintain in confidence all trade secrets and confidential

contain any computer code designed to disrupt, disable or harm in any manner
the operation of any software or hardware. To the Companys knowledge, none of
the Company Intellectual Property contains any worm, bomb, backdoor, clock,
timer or other disabling device, code, design or routine which causes the
software or any portion thereof to be erased, inoperable or otherwise
incapable of being Used, either automatically, with the passage of time or

assigns to any Person other than the Company or a Subsidiary any ownership
right with respect to any Intellectual Property developed by the Company or

making) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any registration,
declaration, or filing with, or an exemption by, any Governmental Entity, or
other third party, required to be obtained or made by such party or its
subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions or the taking of any action
contemplated thereby or by this Agreement.



 

-55- 4.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt written
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt written notice to the Company,
of, and promptly deliver supplemental information reasonably requested by
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, explaining (i) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event which is likely to cause any representation or
warranty of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, Merger Sub or Merger LLC,
on the other hand, contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in
any material respect at or prior to the Effective Time, (ii) any failure of
the Company or Parent, as applicable, to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant or condition to be complied with or satisfied by
it under this Agreement and (iii) any event, condition, fact or circumstance
that would reasonably be expected to make any of the conditions set forth in
Article V incapable of timely satisfaction. None of the foregoing notices or
supplemental information shall be deemed to avoid or cure any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or constitute an amendment of any
representation, warranty or statement in this Agreement or any certificate or
other documents delivered hereunder.

4.8 _No Solicitation_.

(a) Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary or any of their respective officers, directors, current Employees,
financial advisors, legal advisors or representatives (collectively, the "
_Representatives_ ") will, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or initiate any
inquiry, proposal or offer from, or agree to enter into, execute or deliver
any Contracts with, any Person (other than Parent or its Affiliates) relating
to (A) any merger, share issuance or exchange, business combination,
reorganization, consolidation or similar transaction involving the Company or
any Subsidiary, (B) the acquisition of beneficial ownership of any equity
interest in the Company or any Subsidiary, whether by issuance by the Company
or any Subsidiary or by purchase (through a tender offer, exchange offer,
negotiated purchase or otherwise) from the stockholders of the Company or
otherwise, other than upon exercise of Company Warrants and Company Options
outstanding as of the Agreement Date, upon conversion of any Company Preferred
Shares, or (C) the license or transfer of all or a material portion of the
assets of the Company (any of the transactions described in clauses (A)
through (C), a " _Third-Party Acquisition_ "); or (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate with, knowingly
facilitate or knowingly encourage any effort or attempt by any Person to do or
seek, a Third-Party Acquisition; _provided_ , _however_ , that, at any time
prior to the approval of this Agreement by the Stockholders in accordance
with the DGCL, if the Company receives a bona fide written proposal regarding
a Third-Party Acquisition that was unsolicited and did not otherwise result
from a breach of this Section 4.8(a), the Company may furnish non-public
information with respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries to the Person who
made such proposal and may participate in discussions regarding such Third-
Party Acquisition if at least a majority of the members of the Company
Board determines in good faith, after receiving advice from independent
outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would constitute a violation of
the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Stockholders under applicable
Law, the Company Board determines that such Third-Party Acquisition is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and prior to the disclosure
of any non-public information with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary,
such Person enters into a confidentiality agreement with the Company that is
not, in any material respect, less restrictive as to such Person than the
Confidentiality Agreement.  



 

-56-  The Company, the Subsidiaries and their Representatives shall immediately
cease all discussions and negotiations regarding any proposal that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Third-Party
Acquisition.

(b) In the event the Company or any Representative receives an unsolicited
inquiry, proposal or offer relating to a Third-Party Acquisition, (i) the
Company will promptly (and in any event within one Business Day after such
receipt) notify Parent of such inquiry, proposal or offer, including the
identity of the other Person and the material terms of such inquiry, proposal
or offer and (ii) the Company shall be permitted to provide a response without
breaching this Section 4.8; _provided_ that, except as otherwise permitted
under Section 4.8(a), the response is limited to informing the initiator of
such inquiry, proposal or offer that the Company is unable to respond further
at this time. If the Company makes a determination under the final sentence
of Section 4.8(a) that it is permitted to furnish non-public information
and/or engage in discussions or negotiations with another Person, the Company
shall, within one Business Day after such determination, notify Parent in
writing of such determination and the basis therefor, and shall keep Parent
informed, on a current basis, of the status of such discussions or
negotiations and the terms being discussed or negotiated.

4.9 _Company Employee Plans_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide the Employees
with benefits that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the
benefits provided to similarly-situated employees of Parent and its
Affiliates. To the extent that service is relevant for purposes of
eligibility, vesting, calculation of any benefit, or benefit accrual under any
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by
Parent following the Effective Time for the benefit of the Employees, such
plan, program or arrangement shall credit such Employees for service up to and
including the Effective Time with the Company or any of the Subsidiaries. In
addition, with respect to any welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1)
of ERISA) established or maintained by Parent following the Effective Time
for the benefit of the Employees, such plan shall waive any pre-existing
condition exclusions and provide that any covered expenses incurred on or
before the Effective Time by any Employee or by a covered dependent shall be
taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Effective Time.

(b) Effective immediately preceding the Closing, the Company will terminate
any and all Company Employee Plans intended to qualify as a qualified cash
or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Company
401(k) Plans_ ") and effective immediately prior to the Closing, no Employee
shall have any right to contribute any amounts to any Company 401(k) Plans.
Parent shall cause the trustee of the defined contribution plan intended to
qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of
the Code in which United States employees participate (the " _Parent 401(k)
Plan_ "), to accept "eligible rollover distributions" (as such term is
defined under Section 402 of the Code) from the Company 401(k) Plan if the
Company 401(k) Plan has been qualified as a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code and only to the extent such
"eligible rollover distributions" may be accepted pursuant to the terms of the
Parent 401(k) Plan without constituting a breach or violation of the Parent
401(k) Plan or applicable Law. At the request of Parent, the Company will
provide Parent with evidence that such Company Employee Plans have  



 

-57-  been terminated effective immediately prior to the Closing pursuant to
resolutions duly adopted by the Company Board. In addition, at the request of
Parent, the Company will terminate any and all other Company Employee Plans,
including any group health, dental, severance, separation or salary
continuation plans, programs or arrangements, effective either immediately
prior to the Closing or thereafter as specified by Parent and, at the request
of Parent, the Company will provide Parent with evidence that such Company
Employee Plans have been so terminated pursuant to resolutions duly adopted by
the Company Board.

(c) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide Parent with the following information for
each outstanding Company Common Share issued upon exercise of an option: the
name and domicile address of the holder of such Company Common Share on record
with the Company, the date of grant of such option, an indication of whether
such holder is a current employee of the Company or a Subsidiary (and if not
a current employee of the Company or a Subsidiary, the date of termination of
such individuals employment or service), the total number of Company Common
Shares issuable upon exercise of such option on the date of grant and any
amendment thereto, the exercise price of such option, whether such option was
intended to be an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the
Code, the date(s) such option was exercised, the number of Company Common
Shares issued upon each date of exercise and the method of payment of the
exercise price for such option.

4.10  _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Conduct of the Company_. From the Agreement Date until the Effective
Time, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall make or change any
material election in respect of Taxes, adopt or change any accounting method
in respect of Taxes, enter into any closing agreement, settle any claim or
assessment in respect of Taxes, or consent to any extension or waiver of the
limitation period applicable to any claim or assessment in respect of Taxes,
except with the prior written consent of Parent.

(b) _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by the
Stockholders when due, and the Stockholders will, at their own expense, file
all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and
fees, and, if required by applicable Law, Parent will join in the execution
of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. If an amount payable to any
Person pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to Taxes pursuant to this
Section 4.10(b), then a portion of such amount equal to the amount of such
Taxes shall, to the extent required by law, be withheld from the payment to
such Person and remitted to the appropriate Tax Authority.

(c) _Clearance Certificates_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver
to Parent a clearance certificate or similar document(s) which may be required
by any Tax Authority to relieve Parent of (i) any obligation to withhold
Taxes in connection with the Transactions and (ii) any liability for Taxes
(determined without regard to provisions of this Agreement assigning
responsibility therefor) for which relief is available by reason of
the filing of an appropriate certificate or other document.



 

-58- (d) _Tax Returns_. The Company will promptly provide or make available to
Parent copies of all Tax Returns, reports and information statements that are
filed after the Agreement Date and prior to the Closing Date.

(e) _Tax Contests_. The Parent shall have the right to control any Tax audit,
initiate any claim for refund, contest, resolve and defend against any
assessment, notice of deficiency, or other adjustment or proposed adjustment
relating to any and all Taxes for any taxable period ending on or prior to
December 31, 2005 with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary; _provided_
that the Stockholder Representative shall have the right to participate in any
Tax proceeding concerning such matters at its own expense directly or through
counsel. Parent shall not agree to any settlement of, or entry of any judgment
arising from, any such Tax proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Stockholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(f) _Tax Carryforwards_. The Company agrees to cooperate with Parent and
provide any factual information requested by Parent that is reasonably
necessary for Parent to determine the limitations, if any, on the Companys
tax carryforwards under Sections 382, 383 and 384 of the Code or any similar
provision of Law of any other jurisdiction applicable to the Company or any
Subsidiary. In furtherance of the foregoing, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that, on or before the Closing
Date, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Parent
the following information: (i) any information known to the Company regarding
the ownership of the equity of the Company from the time the Company was
formed through the Agreement Date (including any capitalization tables,
option tables or redemption tables known to the Company with respect to the
equity of the Company showing the ownership of Company stock or options, the
dates any such stock or options were issued or transferred, and the prices and
(if applicable) strike prices at which any such stock or options were
issued), (ii) any information known to the Company regarding any relationships
between or among the Shareholders, (iii) any valuation-type spreadsheets,
memoranda, offering documents, resolutions of the Company Board, or similar
materials of the Company that have been prepared by or for the Company in
connection with any stock offerings, option issuances, changes in option
pricing or redemptions, if any, and (iv) any written analysis known to the
Company that has been conducted regarding whether there is any limitation on
its Tax carryforwards under the foregoing Code sections.

(g) _Tax Consequences_. The parties hereto intend that the Merger and the
Upstream Merger, considered together as a single integrated transaction for
United States federal income tax purposes, shall constitute a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code. The parties hereto
adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the U.S. Income Tax Regulations. The
parties are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would preclude the
Merger and the Upstream Merger, considered together as a single integrated
transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, from qualifying
for treatment as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes and
have not and will not take any actions inconsistent with such treatment.

(h) _FIRPTA_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
notice that the Company Capital Shares are not "U.S. real property interests"
in accordance with Treasury Regulations under Sections 897 and 1445 of the
Code, together with evidence  



 

-59-  reasonably satisfactory to Parent that the Company had provided notice to
the Internal Revenue Service in accordance with the provisions of Section
1.897-2(h)(2) of the Treasury Regulations. If Parent does not receive the
notice described above prior to the Closing Date, Parent or Merger Sub shall
be permitted to withhold from the payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement any required withholding Tax under Section 1445 of the Code.

4.11 _Exercise and Termination of Company Stock Rights_. Promptly after the
Agreement Date, the Company shall deliver proper notice to each holder of a
Company Option and to each holder of a Company Warrant informing such holder
of the effect of the Transactions on the Company Options and Company Warrants.

 

4.12 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers of the Company_.

(a) _Indemnification Obligations_. Subject to _Schedule 6.2(e)_ , during the
period beginning at the Effective Time and ending six years after the
Effective Time, Parent will ensure that the Surviving Corporation (and the
surviving entity in the Upstream Merger) fulfills and honors the obligations
of the Company to the Companys present and former directors and officers (the
" _Indemnified D andOs_") pursuant to the terms of the Company Certificate of
Incorporation and the Companys By-laws as in effect on the Agreement Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
claims asserted or made within such six-year period shall continue until the
disposition of such claim.

(b) _D andO Insurance_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
purchase an extended reporting period endorsement under the Companys
existing directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the
Companys directors and officers in a form acceptable to the Company which
shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six years
following the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and
have other terms not materially less favorable to, the insured persons than
the directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently
maintained by the Company and such other directors and officers liability
insurance coverage as determined by the Company, and the Company shall pay all
premiums associated therewith (the " _Premiums_ ") prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall provide commercially reasonable cooperation to the
Indemnified DandOs in order to afford the Indemnified DandOs the right to receive
any payment to which they are entitled under such insurance policy or
policies.

(c) _Beneficiaries_. Section 4.12(a) and the last sentence of Section
4.12(b) shall survive the consummation of the Merger, are intended, from and
after the Effective Time, to benefit the Indemnified DandOs, shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation (including the
surviving entity in the Upstream Merger), and, from and after the Effective
Time, shall be enforceable by the Indemnified DandOs. In the event Parent or the
Surviving Corporation (including the surviving entity in the Upstream Merger)
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (including the surviving entity in the Upstream Merger), as the
case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 4.12.



 

-60- 4.13 _Resignation of Directors_. The Company shall obtain the resignations of
all directors of the Company and such directors of the Subsidiaries as Parent
designates in writing, effective as of the Effective Time, which such
resignations shall not prejudice in any manner any contractual rights of such
directors.

4.14 _Antitrust Filings_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Agreement Date, Parent and the
Company will, and the Company will cause any Affiliate required to make an
Antitrust Filing to, (i) file with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission premerger notification and report Forms under and in
compliance with the HSR Act with respect to the Merger and the other
Transactions and (ii) each make in timely fashion such other filings as Parent
deems necessary or desirable in connection with the Merger under applicable
Antitrust Laws ((i) and (ii) collectively, (the " _Antitrust Filings_ ") with
the appropriate Governmental Entity designated by Law to receive such filings
(with respect to a non-U.S. Antitrust Filing, a " _Foreign Antitrust
Governmental Entity_ "). Parent and the Company shall furnish to each other
all information required for any necessary filing or other application in
connection with the Merger and the other Transactions. Parent and the Company
shall share equally all filing fees in connection with the Antitrust Filings.

(b) The Company and Parent shall each cooperate reasonably with the other in
connection with resolving any inquiry or investigation by the U.S. Department
of Justice or the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or any Foreign Antitrust
Governmental Entity relating to their respective Antitrust Filings. The
Company and Parent shall each promptly inform the other of any communication
with, and any proposed understanding, agreement, or undertaking with the U.S.
Department of Justice or the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or any
Foreign Antitrust Governmental Entity relating to its Antitrust Filings and
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed written communication
to any Governmental Entity. As promptly as is practicable after receiving any
request from the U.S. Department of Justice or the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission under the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Governmental Entity for
information, documents or other materials in connection with the review of the
Antitrust Filings, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such request. The Company and
Parent shall each give the other reasonable advance notice of, and the
opportunity to participate in (through its counsel and/or others) any inquiry
or investigation by, or any meeting or conference (whether by
telecommunications or in person) with, the U.S. Department of Justice or the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission or any Foreign Antitrust Governmental Entity
relating to the Antitrust Filings. The Company and Parent shall each furnish
the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings, and communications
(and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) drafted by or in
conjunction with outside counsel between it and its Affiliate and respective
representatives on the one hand and any Governmental Entity or members of such
Governmental Entitys staff on the other hand, concerning the review,
clearance or approval of the Transactions under the HSR Act or any similar
applicable Law, except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law or the
instructions of such Governmental Entity.

(c) Each of Parent and Company hereby covenants and agrees to use reasonable
best efforts to secure termination or expiration of any waiting periods under
the HSR  



 

-61-  Act or any other applicable domestic or foreign Law and to obtain the
approval of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice,
or any other Governmental Entity, as applicable, for the Merger and other
Transactions.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to (i) make
proposals, execute or carry out agreements or submit to orders providing for
the sale or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment
of a trust or otherwise) of any assets of Parent or any of its Affiliates or
the Company or any of its Affiliates or the holding separate of the shares of
stock of the Company (or shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation or
limited liability company interests of Merger LLC) or imposing or seeking to
impose any material limitation on the ability of Parent or any of its
Affiliates to conduct their business or own such assets or to acquire, hold or
exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of stock of the Company (or
shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation or limited liability company
interests of Merger LLC), or (ii) take any action under this Section if the
United States Department of Justice or the United States Federal Trade
Commission, or any Governmental Entity administering any other applicable
Antitrust Law, authorizes its staff to seek a preliminary injunction or
restraining order to enjoin consummation of the Merger.

 

4.15 _Registration of Shares_.

(a) Parent agrees to file with the SEC, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time, but in any event within fifteen (15) Business
Days thereafter, a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to Rule
415 under the Securities Act (the " _Registration Statement_ ") covering the
resale on a delayed or continuous basis by the Participating Holders of the
Parent Common Stock issued to the Participating Holders pursuant to the Merger
(other than shares of Parent Common Stock issuable as contingent
consideration as described in Section 1.10) (the " _Registrable Shares_ "),
_provided_ that such shares shall cease to be "Registrable Shares" on the
first anniversary of the Closing Date or such earlier date as such shares are
sold under the Registration Statement. If Parent is eligible as a WKSI, the
Registration Statement shall utilize the automatic shelf registration process
under Rule 415 and Rule 462 under the Securities Act, and in connection
therewith, Parent agrees to make any other filings with the SEC required to be
made prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, including, if
required, a Current Report on Form 8-K with respect to the closing of the
Transactions and all financial statements required to be included therein,
provided that the Company has provided Parent with all such financial
statements of the Company. If Parent is not eligible as a WKSI, Parent will
use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act as expeditiously as possible and
to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement until the date one
year after the Closing Date or such earlier time as all of the Registrable
Shares covered by the Registration Statement have been sold pursuant thereto.
Parent, the Company, the Participating Holders and the Stockholder
Representative acknowledge that, under current Law, any shares of Parent
Common Stock to be acquired by the Participating Holders as contingent
consideration as described in Section 1.10 shall be deemed, for purposes of
Rule 144 under the Securities Act, to have been acquired on the Closing Date.
In the event that Parent determines that any of the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be acquired by the Participating Holders as contingent consideration
as described in Section 1.10 shall be deemed, for purposes of Rule 144 under
the Securities Act, to  



 

-62-  have been acquired as of any date later than the Closing Date, Parent shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to register such shares for resale
in accordance with this Section 4.15 and to maintain the effectiveness of the
related Registration Statement for a period of one year from the date deemed
to be the acquisition date of such shares by the Participating Holders.

(b) Parent shall notify the Participating Holders of the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement and shall furnish to each Participating
Holder, without charge, such number of copies of the Registration Statement
(including any amendments, supplements and exhibits), the prospectus contained
therein (including each preliminary prospectus and all related amendments and
supplements) and any documents incorporated by reference in the Registration
Statement or such other documents as the Participating Holders may reasonably
request in order to facilitate the sale of the Registrable Shares in the
manner described in the Registration Statement.

(c) Parent shall as promptly as reasonably practicable notify each
Participating Holder of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement with respect to such
Participating Holders Registrable Shares or the receipt of notice of the
initiation of any proceedings for that purpose. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the
effectiveness of such a Registration Statement at the earliest possible
moment. Parent shall promptly notify the Participating Holders of any request
by the SEC for any amendment or supplement to, or additional information in
connection with, the Registration Statement (or prospectus relating thereto).
Parent shall promptly notify each Participating Holder of the filing of the
Registration Statement or any prospectus, amendment or supplement related
thereto or any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement and the
effectiveness of any post-effective amendment.

(d) Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC from time to time such
amendments and supplements to the Registration Statement and prospectus used
in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep the Registration
Statement effective and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act
with respect to the disposition of all of the Registrable Shares until the
first anniversary of the Closing Date. Upon ten (10) Business Days notice,
Parent shall file any supplement or post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement with respect to the plan of distribution (other than a
distribution including an underwritten offering) or a Participating Holders
ownership interests in his, her or its Registrable Shares that is reasonably
necessary to permit the sale of such Participating Holders Registrable Shares
pursuant to the Registration Statement.

(e) Parent may, by written notice to the Participating Holders, (i) delay the
filing of the Registration Statement or (ii) suspend the Registration
Statement after effectiveness and require that the Participating Holders
immediately cease sales of shares pursuant to the Registration Statement, in
the event that (A) Parent is engaged in any activity or transaction or
preparations or negotiations for any activity or transaction that
Parent desires to keep confidential for business reasons, if Parent
determines in good faith that the public disclosure requirements imposed on
Parent under the Securities Act in connection with the Registration Statement
would require disclosure of such activity, transaction, preparations or
negotiations or (B) any financial statements or other information required to
be included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement are not
available. If Parent suspends the Registration  



 

-63-  Statement and requires the Participating Holders to cease sales of shares
pursuant to this Section 4.15(e), Parent shall, as promptly as
practicable following the termination of the circumstance which entitled
Parent to do so, take such actions as may be necessary to file or reinstate
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and give written notice to all
Participating Holders authorizing them to resume sales pursuant to the
Registration Statement. If as a result thereof the prospectus included in the
Registration Statement has been amended to comply with the requirements of the
Securities Act, Parent shall enclose such revised prospectus with the notice
to Participating Holders given pursuant to this Section 4.15(e), and the
Participating Holders shall make no offers or sales of shares pursuant to the
Registration Statement other than by means of such revised prospectus. Parent
need not specify the nature of the event giving rise to any delay or
suspension in any notice to Participating Holders and the holders agree to
treat and keep the existence of such delay or suspension, as the case may
be, confidential. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parent
shall not exercise its rights under this Section 4.15(e) to delay the filing
of the Registration Statement and/or suspend sales of Registrable Shares for
one or more periods (calculated from and including the due date for the
filing of the Registration Statement as set forth in Section 4.15(a) or the
date of receipt by the Participating Holders of notice of any suspension of
sales, as the case may be, through and including the date of filing of the
Registration Statement or date of receipt by the Participating Holders of
notice that sales may resume, as the case may be) in excess of 105 days in the
aggregate in any twelve (12) month period. 

(f) In connection with the filing by Parent of the Registration Statement,
Parent shall furnish to each Participating Holder a copy of the prospectus,
including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the
Securities Act. If Parent has delivered a prospectus to the Participating
Holders and after having done so the prospectus is amended or supplemented to
comply with the requirements of the Securities Act, Parent shall promptly
notify the Participating Holders and, if requested by Parent, the
Participating Holders shall immediately cease making offers or sales of shares
under the previously delivered prospectus. Parent shall promptly provide the
Participating Holders with revised or supplemented prospectuses and, following
receipt of the revised or supplemented prospectuses, if a prospectus related
to the Registration Statement is required at that time to be delivered under
the Securities Act to a transferee, the Participating Holders shall be free to
resume making offers and sales under the Registration Statement.

(g) Parent shall, in connection with the filing of the Registration Statement
hereunder, file such documents as may be necessary to register or qualify the
Registrable Shares under the securities or "blue sky" laws of such states as
the Participating Holders may reasonably request, and Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such filings to become effective in
a timely manner; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated
to qualify as a foreign corporation to do business under the laws of any such
state in which it is not then qualified or to file any general consent to
service of process in any such state.

(h) Neither Parent, nor any of its security holders (other than holders of
Registrable Shares in such capacity) shall have the right to include any
securities of Parent in the Registration Statement other than Registrable
Shares. Parent, only for so long as it has a class of securities registered
under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to continue the listing or trading privileges of the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued hereunder on Parents principal national securities
exchange (currently NASDAQ) on which shares of Parent Common Stock are then
listed or quoted.



 

-64- (i) If at any time prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date while
Registrable Shares are outstanding and the Registration Statement applicable
to such Registrable Shares under Section 4.15(a) is not effective, Parent
proposes to register shares of Parent Common Stock under the Securities Act
for sale to the public (other than a registration effected solely to
implement an employee benefit plan or a transaction to which Rule 145 of the
Securities Act is applicable, a registration statement covering shares
acquired pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act or a registration
statement on Form S-4, S-8 or another form not available for registering the
Registrable Shares for sale to the public), each such time Parent will give
written notice to each Participating Holder of its intention to do so. Upon
the written request of any of such Participating Holders, given within
fifteen (15) days after receipt by such Participating Holder of such notice,
Parent shall cause all such Registrable Shares of the requesting Participating
Holders to be registered under the Securities Act and qualified for sale
under any state securities or "blue sky" law, to the extent required to permit
such sale or other disposition of their Registrable Shares; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such offering of shares of Parent Common Stock is an
underwritten offering and the managing underwriter of such offering determines
that the number of shares of Parent Common Stock sought to be offered should
be limited due to market conditions, then the number of Registrable Shares to
be included in such underwritten public offering shall be reduced by a number
deemed necessary by such managing underwriter, which such Registrable Shares
shall be allocated among the Participating Holders requesting registration on
a pro rata basis.

(j) Parent shall pay the expenses incurred by it in complying with its
obligations under this Section 4.15, including all registration and filing
fees, exchange listing fees, fees and expenses of counsel for Parent, and fees
and expenses of accountants for Parent, but excluding (i) any brokerage fees,
selling commissions or underwriting discounts incurred by the Participating
Holders in connection with sales under the Registration Statement and (ii) the
fees and expenses of any counsel retained by Participating Holders.

(k) Parent shall not be required to include any Registrable Shares in the
Registration Statement unless: (i) the Participating Holder owning
such shares furnishes to Parent in writing such information regarding such
Participating Holder and the proposed sale of shares by such Participating
Holder as Parent may reasonably request in writing in connection with the
Registration Statement or as shall be required in connection therewith by the
SEC or any state securities law authorities; (ii) such Participating Holder
shall have provided to Parent its written agreement: (A) to indemnify Parent
and each of its directors and officers against, and hold Parent and each of
its directors and officers harmless from, any losses, claims, damages,
expenses or liabilities (including reasonable attorneys fees) to which Parent
or such directors and officers may become subject by reason of any statement
or omission in the Registration Statement made in reliance upon, or in
conformity with, a written statement by such Participating Holder furnished
pursuant to this Section 4.15; and (B) to report to Parent sales made
pursuant to the Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, no Participating Holder shall be liable for any
losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities pursuant to this Section 4.15
in excess of the net proceeds to such Participating Holder from the sale of
such Participating Holders Registrable Shares pursuant to a Registration
Statement.



 

-65- (l) Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Participating Holder
whose shares are included in the Registration Statement, and if such
Participating Holder is not an individual, such Participating Holders
directors, officers and each person, if any, that controls a Participating
Holder whose shares are included in the Registration Statement within the
meaning of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages, expenses
or liabilities to which such Participating Holder or other such Person may
become subject by reason of any untrue statement of a material fact
or alleged untrue statement contained in the Registration Statement or any
omission or alleged omission to state therein a fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except
insofar as such losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities arise out of
or are based upon information furnished in writing to Parent by or on behalf
of a Participating Holder for use in the Registration Statement. Parent shall
have the right to assume the defense and settlement of any claim or suit for
which Parent may be responsible for indemnification under this Section 4.15
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. The indemnified
party may participate in any such defense or settlement, but Parent shall not
be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses incurred
by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (x) if Parent fails to take reasonable steps necessary to
defend in good faith the action or proceeding within ten (10) Business Days
after receiving notice from such indemnified party that the indemnified party
believes it has failed to do so; or (y) if such indemnified party who is a
defendant in any action or proceeding which is also brought against Parent
shall have reasonably concluded, based on the advice of counsel, that there
may be one or more legal defenses available to such indemnified party which
are not available to Parent; or (z) if representation of both parties by the
same counsel is otherwise inappropriate under applicable standards of
professional conduct, then, in any such case, the indemnified party shall have
the right to assume or continue its own defense as set forth above (but with
no more than one firm of counsel for all indemnified parties in each
jurisdiction) and Parent shall be liable for any reasonable expenses therefor.
Parent shall not, without the written consent of the indemnified party,
effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to, any action or claim in respect of which
indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder unless
such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release
of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or
claim, and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault,
culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

(m) If the indemnification provided for in Section 4.15(l) is unavailable to
an indemnified party with respect to any losses, claims, damages, expenses or
liabilities referred to therein or is insufficient to hold the indemnified
party harmless as contemplated therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu
of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid
or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims,
damages, expenses or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and
the indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or
omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, expenses or
liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and of the
indemnified party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to,
among other factors, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or omission to state a material fact relates to information
supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the
parties relative intent, knowledge,  



 

-66-  access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement
or omission. Parent and the Participating Holders agree that it would not be
just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4.15(m) were
determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that
fails to take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. No
Participating Holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of
the amount by which the net proceeds to such Participating Holder from the
sale of such Participating Holders Registrable Shares pursuant to a
Registration Statement exceeds the amount of any damages which such
Participating Holder has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of
any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No
Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

(n) Parent covenants that, for so long as Parent has a class of securities
registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, it will file any reports
required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

(o) A Participating Holder may not assign any of its rights under this Section
4.15 except in connection with the transfer of some or all of his, her or its
Registrable Shares to an Immediate Family Member or trust for the benefit of
an individual Participating Holder or one or more of such Participating
Holders Immediate Family Members or, in the case of a partnership, limited
liability company or corporation, to an Affiliate, its partners, members or
stockholders, respectively; _provided_ each such transferee agrees in a
written instrument delivered to Parent to be bound by the provisions of this
Section 4.15.

(p) All of Parents obligations under this Section 4.15 (other than under
Sections 4.15(a) (only the last sentence), (h) (only the last sentence), (l),
(m) and (n)) shall terminate upon the earlier of (a) the first anniversary of
the Closing Date or (b) the date on which no Participating Holder holds any
Registrable Shares. 

4.16 _Stockholder Approval_. Immediately after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the Company shall solicit the approval by written consent of
the Charter Amendment, this Agreement and the Merger by the Stockholders
holding the requisite number of shares of each class of Company Capital Shares
required to approve the Charter Amendment, this Agreement and the Merger
in accordance with the DGCL and the Company Certificate of Incorporation (the
" _Stockholder Approval_ ") and deliver to such Stockholders all information
regarding Parent provided to the Company prior to the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by Parent for delivery to such Stockholders in connection
therewith (the " _Parent Information_ "). As expeditiously as possible
following the execution of this Agreement, and in any event prior to 11:59
p.m. (Eastern Time) on the Agreement Date, the Company shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to secure and cause to be filed with the
Company consents from Stockholders necessary to secure the Stockholder
Approval. No later than five (5) Business Days after the Agreement Date, the
Company shall send to all Stockholders (i) the Disclosure Statement, which
shall include (A) a summary of the Merger, this Agreement and the Charter
Amendment, (B) a statement that the Company Board unanimously recommended
that the Stockholders consent in writing to the approval of the Charter
Amendment, the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger, and
(C) a statement that appraisal rights are available for the Company  



 

-67-  Capital Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and a copy of such
Section 262, (ii) pursuant to Sections 228 and 262(d) of the DGCL, a written
notice to all Stockholders that did not execute such written consent informing
them that this Agreement, the Merger and the Charter Amendment were adopted
and approved by the Stockholders and that appraisal rights are available for
their Company Capital Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (which
notice shall include a copy of Section 262), together with any other
information required by Law and (iii) the Parent Information. The Company
shall promptly inform Parent of the date on which the notice described in the
preceding sentence was sent. The Company shall ensure that the Disclosure
Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (
_provided_ that the Company shall not be responsible for the accuracy or
completeness of any information concerning Parent furnished by Parent in
writing for inclusion in or with the Disclosure Statement).

4.17 _Upstream Merger_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall merge with and into Merger LLC. From and
after the effectiveness of the Upstream Merger, the separate corporate
existence of the Surviving Corporation shall cease and the Merger LLC shall
continue as the surviving entity in the Upstream Merger. The Upstream Merger
shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL. Parent and Merger
LLC shall take all steps and actions as shall be required to cause the
Surviving Corporation and Merger LLC to consummate the Upstream Merger as set
forth in this Section 4.17.

6.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company set
forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the
Company pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Closing, any investigation by
or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or Merger LLC and the Effective Time, and
such representations and warranties shall terminate at 5:00 P.M. Eastern time
on the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, in all cases, with respect to any, claim of which any Indemnified Party
shall have in good faith provided written notice to the Stockholder
Representative in accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to such
termination, then the applicable representation or warranty shall survive
until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of any claims arising from or
related to the matter covered by such notice.



 

-72- 6.2 _Indemnification_. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.3,
each Participating Holder, severally, and on a Pro Rata Basis, shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC, the
Surviving Corporation and each of their officers, directors, employees,
members, agents and Affiliates (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, interest and
penalties, costs and reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses, and reasonable expenses of investigation and defense
(collectively " _Losses_ ") incurred or suffered by any such Indemnified
Parties directly or indirectly as a result of, with respect to or in
connection with:

(a) the breach, as of the Agreement Date or as of the Closing Date, of any
representation or warranty of the Company set forth herein or in
any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including the
Allocation Certificate and the Officers Certificate (for purposes of this
Section 6.2(a), the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
herein shall be deemed to be made as of the Agreement Date and as of the
Closing Date);

(b) any failure by the Company to perform, fulfill or comply with
any covenant set forth in this Agreement;

(c) any Dissenting Share Payments;

(d) any loss, liability or expense of the Stockholder Representative, acting
in such capacity;

(e) the matters described in _Schedule 6.2(e)_;

(f) any claim by a stockholder or former stockholder of the Company, or any
other Person, seeking to assert, or based upon: (i) ownership or rights to
ownership of any shares of stock of the Company; (ii) any rights of a
stockholder (other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this Agreement or appraisal rights under the applicable provisions of the

Transactions, including its fiduciary duties under the DGCL; or

(g) any Transaction Expenses incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in
excess of the Estimated Transaction Expenses, but only to the extent such
Transaction Expenses were not included in the determination of the Closing Net
Working Capital. 

6.3 _Limitations_.

(a) Except as provided in Section 6.3(e), after the Closing, the
Participating Holders shall not be liable to indemnify any Indemnified Party
for money damages pursuant to Section 6.2 in an aggregate amount in excess of
the Escrow Amount, no Participating Holder shall be liable to indemnify any
Indemnified Party for money damages pursuant to Section 6.2 in  



 

-73-  an aggregate amount in excess of such Participating Holders pro rata share
of the Escrow Amount, and the Escrow Amount shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy for any Losses for which the Indemnified Parties are
entitled to be indemnified pursuant to Section 6.2. No indemnification claim
under Section 6.2(a) may be made against the Escrow Amount for any individual
claim for Losses of less than $20,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), nor until the
aggregate dollar amount of Losses for all claims that individually equal or
exceed the Threshold equal or exceed $1,000,000 (the " _Basket_ "), after
which Parent shall be indemnified for all Losses in excess of $500,000, up to
an aggregate amount equal to the Escrow Amount; _provided_ that the
limitations set forth in this sentence shall not apply to a claim relating to
the capitalization set forth in Allocation Certificate or a breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.1 (first and second
sentences thereof only), 2.2 or 2.24. For purposes of this Article VI, all
representations and warranties of the Company in Article II (other than
Sections 2.9(u) and 2.34) shall be construed as if the terms "material" and
"in all material respects" (and variations thereof) and any reference to
"Company Material Adverse Effect" (and variations thereof) were omitted from
such representations and warranties.

(b) No indemnification shall be payable to an Indemnified Party with respect
to claims asserted by such Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 6.2 after
5:00 P.M. Eastern time on the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date, except
that, in all cases, with respect to any claim of which any Indemnified Party
shall have provided written notice to the Stockholder Representative in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to such termination.

(c) There shall be no liability of the Participating Holders or with respect
to the foregoing indemnification obligations under any provision of this
Agreement for any punitive damages (except punitive damages payable to a
third party). The amount of Losses recoverable by an Indemnified Party under
this Article VI with respect to an indemnity claim shall be reduced by the
amount of any payment received by such Indemnified Party, with respect to the
Losses to which such indemnity claim relates, from an insurance carrier;
provided that Parent is not obligated for any retroactive premium under the
applicable insurance policy. An Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue insurance claims to which it may be entitled in
connection with any Losses it incurs, provided that Parent shall not be
required to pursue any litigation or similar remedy against any insurance
carrier.

(d) Any liability for indemnification under Section 6.2 shall be determined
without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise
to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement. The Indemnified Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate Losses for which indemnification
may be claimed by them pursuant to this Agreement to the extent required to
do so by applicable Law.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VI, the
limitations set forth in this Article VI shall not apply with respect to (i)
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach or misconduct, or (ii)
any equitable remedy, including a preliminary or permanent injunction
or specific performance.

(f) Except as set forth in Section 6.3(e), Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC and
the Indemnified Parties agree that, after the Closing, the sole and exclusive
remedy for money damages for any matters relating to this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and any certificate or instrument delivered pursuant hereto
shall be the rights to indemnification set forth in this Article VI.  



 

-74- (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) the aggregate
liability of Parent and its Affiliates for breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in Article III hereof or in any certificate delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall not exceed $33.0 million and (ii) neither
Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be liable for any individual claim for
Losses until the aggregate dollar amount of Losses for all claims in excess of
the Threshold exceed the Basket, after which Parent shall be liable for Losses
in excess of $500,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitations set
forth herein shall not apply with respect to the liability of Parent for any
claims arising under Section 10(b) under the Exchange Act and any rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder.

6.4 _Procedures_.

(a) _Post-Closing Claims Against the Escrow Amount_. The procedure for making
indemnification claims under this Agreement (other than Third-Party Claims as
described in clause (b) below) against the Escrow Amount after the Closing is
as follows:

 

(i) In order to seek indemnification, an Indemnified Party shall deliver a
Claim Notice to the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent. 

(ii) Within 20 days after receipt of a Claim Notice from an Indemnified Party,
the Stockholder Representative shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a
Response, in which the Stockholder Representative shall: (i) agree that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which
case the Stockholder Representative and the Indemnified Party shall deliver
to the Escrow Agent, within three days following the delivery of the Response,
a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to
distribute to Parent from the Escrow Amount an amount in cash equal to the
Claimed Amount), (ii) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive
the Agreed Amount (in which case the Stockholder Representative and the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three days
following the delivery of the Response, a written notice executed by both
parties instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to Parent from the Escrow
Amount an amount in cash equal to the Agreed Amount), or (iii) dispute that
the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed Amount.

(iii) During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Response that
reflects a Dispute, the Stockholder Representative and the Indemnified Party
shall use good faith efforts to resolve the Dispute. If the Dispute is not
resolved within such 30-day period, the Stockholder Representative and the
Indemnified Party shall discuss in good faith the submission of the Dispute
to binding arbitration, and if the Stockholder Representative and the
Indemnified Party agree in writing to submit the Dispute to such arbitration,
then the provisions of Section 6.4(a)(iv) shall become effective with respect
to such Dispute. The provisions of this Section 6.4(a) shall not obligate the
Stockholder Representative and the Indemnified Party to submit to arbitration
or any other alternative dispute resolution procedure with respect to
any Dispute, and in the absence of an agreement by the Stockholder

(iv) If, as set forth in Section 6.4(a)(iii), the Indemnified Party and the

binding arbitration, the arbitration shall be conducted by a single
arbitrator (the " _Arbitrator_ ") mutually agreed upon by the parties in
accordance with the Commercial Rules in effect from time to time and the

therefor. Any award rendered by the Arbitrator regarding the matters in
dispute shall be final, non-appealable, conclusive and binding upon the

authority to grant injunctive relief, specific performance or other equitable
relief.

(F) The Arbitrator shall have no power or authority, under the Commercial
Rules or otherwise, to (x) modify or disregard any provision of this

expenses as the Arbitrator may determine to be directly related to the
conduct of the arbitration and appropriately borne jointly by the parties

(if any), costs of investigation and similar expenses) shall be shared
equally by the Indemnified Party and the Participating Holders. The
Stockholder Representative shall be entitled, upon written notice to the
Escrow Agent, to pay any such costs, fees and expenses to be borne by the
Participating Holders from any distributions to be made to the Participating
Holders under the Escrow Agreement.

(b) _Third-Party Claims_. Promptly after the assertion by any third party of
any claim against any Indemnified Party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") that, in
the judgment of such Indemnified Party, may result in the incurrence by such
Indemnified Party of Losses for which such Indemnified Party would be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, such Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative a written notice describing in
reasonable detail such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no
delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Stockholder
Representative shall relieve the Participating Holders of any liability or
obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that the
Participating Holders have been materially prejudiced thereby, and then only
to such extent. The Stockholder Representative shall have the right in his
sole discretion at any time to conduct the defense of any such Third-Party
Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ that (i) the Stockholder Representative may only assume such
defense if (A) it acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party that any
damages, fines, costs or other liabilities that may be assessed against the
Indemnified Party in connection with such Third-Party Claim would constitute
Losses for which the Indemnified Party would be indemnified pursuant to this
Article VI and (B) the _ad damnum_ is less than or equal to 50% of the
balance of the Escrow Fund at such time and (ii) the Stockholder
Representative may not assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim involving
criminal liability or in which equitable relief is sought against the
Indemnified Party. In the event that the Stockholder Representative assumes
defense of such Third-Party Claim, (i) the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim at his, her or
its own expense directly or through counsel, and (ii) the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim if the
Stockholder Representative shall cease at any time to conduct a good faith
defense of such Third-Party Claim. If the Stockholder Representative does
not, or is not permitted under the terms hereof to, assume conduct of the
defense of any Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall control
such defense. In the event that the Stockholder Representative does not, or
is not permitted under the terms hereof to, assume conduct of the defense of
such Third-Party Claim and the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of such
Third-Party Claim, (i) the Stockholder Representative shall have the right
to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim at his own expense
directly or through counsel and (ii) the Stockholder Representative shall have
the right to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim if the Indemnified
Party shall cease at any time to conduct a good faith defense of such Third-
Party Claim. The  



 

-77-  Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any such Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Stockholder Representative, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If any such Third-Party Claim
is settled with the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative,
or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for the amount of any
Losses relating thereto, subject to the provisions of Section 6.3. The
Stockholder Representative shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry
of any judgment arising from, any Third-Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party with respect to a Third-Party
Claim shall be considered Losses for purposes of this Agreement if (i) the
Indemnified Party controls the defense of such Third-Party Claim pursuant to
the terms of this Section 6.4(b) or (ii) the Stockholder Representative
assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes
that the Stockholder Representative and the Indemnified Party have
conflicting interests or different defenses available with respect to such
Third-Party Claim.

(c) The rights to indemnification set forth in this Article VI shall not be
affected by (i) any investigation conducted by or on behalf of an Indemnified
Party or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by an
Indemnified Party, whether before or after the Agreement Date or the Closing
Date (including through supplements to the Disclosure Schedule) or (ii) any
waiver by an Indemnified Party of any closing condition relating to the
accuracy of representations and warranties or the performance of or compliance
with agreements and covenants.

6.5 _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. The Company, Parent and the
Participating Holders agree to treat each indemnification payment pursuant to
this Article VI as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all Tax
purposes and shall take no position contrary thereto unless required to do so
by applicable Tax Law pursuant to a determination as defined in Section
1313(a) of the Code.

Representative.

required of the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder
Representative shall receive no compensation for his services. Notices or

(d) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to any Participating
Holder for any act done or omitted under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement as the Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith and any
act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive

severally indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold him harmless
against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or
bad faith on the part of the Stockholder Representative and arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties under this
Agreement. The Stockholder Representative may receive reimbursement directly
from the Participating Holders (or from any distribution to the Participating
Holders to be made under the Escrow Agreement) for any and all expenses,
charges and liabilities, including attorneys fees, reasonably incurred by the
Stockholder Representative in the performance or discharge of his rights and
obligations under this agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Merger LLC or any of their respective
Affiliates shall have any liability with respect to such items.

(e) The Stockholder Representative shall have access to relevant information
about the Company and the reasonable assistance of Parents employees, upon

disrupt or interfere with business operations, for purposes of performing his
duties and exercising his rights under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement;  _provided_ that the Stockholder Representative shall treat
confidentially and not use or disclose to anyone any nonpublic information
from or about the Company (except for disclosures on a need to know basis to
individuals who agree to treat such information confidentially under terms of
a confidentiality agreement reasonably acceptable to Parent).

(f) Any notice or communication given or received by, and any decision,
action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent,
settlement, resolution or instruction of, the Stockholder Representative shall
constitute a notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure
to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement,
resolution or instruction of all the Participating Holders and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each such Participating Holder; and each
Indemnified  



 

-79-  Party and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any such notice,
communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated period
of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction as being a
notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within
a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction of, each and every such Participating Holder. Each Indemnified
Party and the Escrow Agent are hereby relieved from any liability to any
Person for any acts done by them in accordance with any such notice,
communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of
time, agreement, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative.

asserted by or against or involving any such Participating Holder (other than

Representative on behalf of such Participating Holder (and not by such
Participating Holder acting on its own behalf). The parties hereby acknowledge

9.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the schedules and Exhibits hereto, the
Disclosure Schedule and the documents and instruments and other agreements
among the parties hereto referenced herein constitute the entire agreement
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements (except for the Confidentiality Agreement) and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof.



 

-100- 9.3 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the greatest
extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

9.4 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

9.5 _Disclosure Schedule_. No matter disclosed in one section of the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed in another section of the
Disclosure Schedule unless it is reasonably apparent on the face of the
disclosure that the matter is responsive to another representation. Disclosure
of a matter in a section of the Disclosure Schedule shall not affect
(directly or indirectly) the interpretation of this Agreement or the scope of
the disclosure obligation of the Company under this Agreement. The fact that
any matter or event is disclosed in a section of the Disclosure Schedule does
not necessarily mean that it is material to the Company and the Subsidiaries,
whether considered individually or in combination with other matters or events
disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule.

9.6 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, the parties (a) will pay their own

none of the provisions of this Agreement is intended to provide any rights or
remedies to any Person other than the parties and their respective successors
and assigns, if any.

9.8 _Waiver_. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No waiver by any party with respect to any
default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder shall
be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or
breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights
arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

9.9 _Amendment_. After the Closing and except as otherwise may be required
by applicable Law, Section 1.10 of this Agreement may be amended with respect

otherwise, in any such proceeding commenced in any Court, any claim that such

proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter of this
Agreement may not be enforced in or by such Court.
