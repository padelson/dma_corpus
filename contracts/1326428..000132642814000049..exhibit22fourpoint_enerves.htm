are not available,



7

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





estimates will be used subject to final adjustments in accordance with Section
3.6 and Section 3.7.

3.5 Preliminary Settlement Statement. Not less than five Business Days prior
to Closing, Seller shall prepare and submit to Buyer for review a draft
settlement statement (the "Preliminary Settlement Statement") that shall set
forth the Adjusted Purchase Price, reflecting each adjustment made in
accordance with this Agreement as of the date of preparation of such
Preliminary Settlement Statement and the calculation of the adjustments used
to determine such amount, together with the designation of Seller's accounts
for the wire transfers of funds as set forth in Section 3.1 and Section
12.3(d). Within two Business Days after receipt of the Preliminary Settlement
Statement, Buyer will deliver to Seller a written report containing all
changes, with explanation therefor, that Buyer proposes to be made to the
Preliminary Settlement Statement, if any. The Parties shall in good faith
attempt to agree on the Preliminary Settlement Statement as soon as possible
after Seller's receipt of Buyer's written report. The Preliminary Settlement
Statement, as agreed upon by the Parties, will be used to adjust the Purchase
Price at Closing; provided that if the Parties do not agree on an adjustment
set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement prior to the Closing, the
amount of such adjustment set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement as
presented by Seller will be used to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing.

3.6 Final Settlement Statement.

(a) On or before 150 days after the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a
final settlement statement (the "Final Settlement Statement") prepared by
Seller based on actual income and expenses during the Interim Period and which
takes into account all final adjustments made to the Purchase Price and shows
the resulting final Adjusted Purchase Price (the "Final Price"). The Final
Settlement Statement shall set forth the actual proration of the amounts
required by this Agreement. As soon as practicable, and in any event within 30
days after receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, Buyer will deliver to
Seller a written report containing any proposed changes to the Final
Settlement Statement and an explanation of any such changes and the reasons
therefor (the "Dispute Notice"). Any changes not so specified in the Dispute
Notice shall be deemed waived and Seller's determinations with respect to all
such elements of the Final Settlement Statement that are not addressed
specifically in the Dispute Notice shall prevail. If Buyer fails to timely
deliver a Dispute Notice to Seller containing changes Buyer proposes to be
made to the Final Settlement Statement, the Final Settlement Statement as
delivered by Seller will be deemed to be correct and mutually agreed upon by
the Parties, and will be final and binding on the Parties and not subject to
further audit or arbitration. If the Final Price set forth in the Final
Settlement Statement is mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer, the Final
Settlement Statement and the Final Price shall be final and binding on the
Parties, subject to the provisions of Section 2.3(b). Any difference in the
Adjusted Purchase Price as paid at Closing pursuant to the Preliminary
Settlement Statement and the Final Price shall be paid by the owing Party to
the owed Party within 10 days after final determination of such owed amounts
in accordance herewith. All amounts paid pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall be
delivered in United States currency by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account specified in writing by the relevant Party.

(b) Should any adjustment provided for in Section 3.3be required after such
adjustments under Section 3.6(a) are concluded, such adjustments shall be made
by appropriate payments from Buyer to Seller or from Seller to Buyer, as
provided under Section 2.3(b). The obligations of the Parties to the payments
described in the preceding sentence shall terminate on the later of September
30, 2015 or the date that a decision is rendered pursuant to the Accounting
Arbitrator in Section 3.7 and any payments required by such decisions have
been made.

3.7 Disputes. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve the matters addressed
in the Dispute Notice (if any), each of Buyer and Seller shall within 14
Business Days after the delivery of such Dispute Notice, summarize its
position with regard to such dispute in a written document of 20 pages or less
and submit such summaries to the Houston office of PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP
(the "Accounting Arbitrator"), together with the Dispute Notice, the Final
Settlement Statement and any other documentation such Party may desire to
submit. If PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP is unable or unwilling to serve as
Accounting Arbitrator under this Section 3.7, the Houston office of Ernst and
Young LLP, or such other Person as the Parties may mutually select shall serve
as Accounting Arbitrator. Within 20 Business Days after receiving the Parties'
respective submissions, the Accounting Arbitrator shall render a decision
choosing either Seller's position or Buyer's position with respect to each
matter addressed in any Dispute Notice, based on the materials submitted to
the Accounting Arbitrator as described above. Any decision rendered by the
Accounting Arbitrator pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and binding
on Seller and Buyer and will be enforceable against the Parties in any court
of competent jurisdiction. The costs of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be
borne pro rata between the Parties with each Party being responsible for the
Accounting Arbitrator's costs to the extent the Accounting Arbitrator has not
selected such Party's position on an aggregate dollar basis with respect to
all amounts submitted for resolution by the Accounting Arbitrator.

3.8 Allocation of Purchase Price/Allocated Values.

(a) The "Allocated Values" for (i) the Wells and Well Locations as to the
applicable Target Formation and (ii) the other Conveyed Interests are set
forth on Exhibit G. The Allocated Value for a Well or a Well Location (as to
the applicable Target Formation) is equal to the portion of the Unadjusted
Purchase Price that is allocated to such Well or Well Location (as to the
applicable Target Formation) on Exhibit G, increased or decreased by a share
of each adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price in accordance with Section
3.3. The share of each adjustment allocated to a particular Well or Well
Location (as to the applicable Target Formation) shall be allocated to the
particular Well or Well Location (as to the applicable Target Formation) to
which such adjustment relates to the extent such adjustment relates to such
Well or Well Location (as to the applicable Target Formation) and to the
extent that it is, in the commercially reasonable discretion of Seller,
possible to do so. Any adjustment not allocated to a specific Well or Well
Location (as to the applicable Target Formation) pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence shall be allocated among the remaining Conveyed Interests
on a pro-rata basis in proportion to the Unadjusted Purchase Price allocated
to such Conveyed Interests on Exhibit G. Seller has accepted such Allocated
Values for purposes of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, but makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of such
values.

(b) For purposes of Income Taxes, Asset Taxes, and other Taxes, Buyer and
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree to an allocation of
the Purchase Price,



9

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code, and Treasury Regulations
thereunder (and, as adjusted hereunder, if applicable, in accordance with any
other similar provision of state or local Law) within 30 days following the
Closing Date. Such agreed allocation schedule shall be reasonably consistent
with the Allocated Values, as adjusted pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer and
Seller shall report the purchase and sale of the Conveyed Interests on all Tax
Returns (including IRS Form 8594) consistently with such agreed allocation and
shall not take any position that is inconsistent with any such agreed
allocation schedule unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Such agreed
allocation may be revised from time to time, upon the mutual written consent
of Buyer and Seller, to take into account any matters that need updating (such
as Purchase Price adjustments, if any).

3.9 Allocation for Imbalances at Closing. If, prior to Closing, either Party
discovers an error in the Imbalances set forth in Schedule 7.11, then the
Purchase Price shall be further adjusted at Closing pursuant to Sections
3.3(a)(vi), 3.3(a)(vii), 3.3(b)(vii) or 3.3(b)(viii), as applicable, and
Schedule 7.11 will be deemed amended immediately prior to Closing to reflect
the Imbalances for which the Purchase Price is so adjusted.

ARTICLE IV

ACCESS / DISCLAIMERS

4.1 Access.

(a) From and after the Execution Date and up to and including the Closing Date
(or earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms herein) but
subject to the other provisions of this Section 4.1 and obtaining of any
required consents of Third Parties, including Third Party operators of the Oil
and Gas Properties and the Midstream Assets (with respect to which consents
Seller shall not be obligated to expend any monies), Seller shall afford to
Buyer and its authorized representatives ("Buyer's Representatives")
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the Oil and Gas Properties
and the Midstream Assets and all Records in Seller's possession or control at
such time to the extent necessary to conduct the title or environmental review
described in Article V and Article VI. All investigations and due diligence
conducted by Buyer or any Buyer's Representative shall be conducted at Buyer's
sole cost, risk and expense and any conclusions made from any examination done
by Buyer or any Buyer's Representative shall result from Buyer's own
independent review and judgment.

(b) From the Execution Date to the Defect Claim Date, Buyer's inspection right
with respect to the Environmental Condition of the Oil and Gas Properties and
the Midstream Assets shall be limited to undertake a Phase I Environmental
Site Assessment of the Oil and Gas Properties and the Midstream Assets
conducted by E.Vironment, LLC, Kleinfelder or such other environmental
consulting or engineering firm approved in advance in writing by Seller (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld), and may include only visual
inspections and record reviews relating to the Properties. In conducting such
inspection, Buyer shall not operate any equipment or conduct any testing or
sampling of soil, groundwater or other materials (including any testing or
sampling for Hazardous Substances, Hydrocarbons or NORM). If the Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment reasonably recommends that any sampling or
invasive activities be conducted on a Conveyed Interest for Buyer to estimate
the Remediation Amount with respect to such Conveyed Interest, Buyer shall (i)
furnish Seller with a written description



10

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





of the proposed scope of such sampling or invasive activities, including a
description of the specific activities to be conducted, and a description of
the approximate location and expected timing of such activities and (ii)
obtain the prior written consent of Seller (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld) and the Third Party operator of the affected Conveyed
Interest to undertake such sampling or invasive activities. Seller shall
respond to any request for such consent within three days of its receipt
thereof. If any of the proposed sampling or invasive activities may
unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the affected Conveyed
Interest, Seller may request an appropriate modification of the proposed
sampling or invasive activities. Any sampling or invasive activities shall be
conducted by a reputable environmental consulting or engineering firm,
approved in advance by Seller (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld).
Buyer shall obtain all permits necessary to conduct any approved sampling or
invasive activities from any applicable Governmental Authorities; provided
that, upon request, Seller shall provide Buyer with assistance as reasonably
requested by Buyer that may be necessary to secure such permits. If Buyer
reasonably requests access to conduct any sampling or invasive activities
pursuant to this Section 4.1(b) and Seller denies Buyer consent to conduct
such sampling or invasive activities, then Buyer may, at its sole election,
elect to exclude such affected Conveyed Interest from the Conveyed Interests
to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by
the Allocated Value of such Conveyed Interest. Buyer shall give Seller
reasonable prior written notice before gaining physical access to any of the
Conveyed Interests, and Seller or its designee shall have the right but not
the obligation to accompany Buyer and Buyer's Representatives whenever Buyer
and/or Buyer's Representative gain physical access to any Conveyed Interests.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not
have access to, and shall not be permitted to conduct any inspections
(including any Phase I Environmental Site Assessment) with respect to, any
Conveyed Interests with respect to which Seller does not have the authority to
grant access for such due diligence; provided that Seller shall request, and
cooperate with Buyer's efforts to obtain, access rights from Third Parties for
Buyer to conduct such inspections (including any Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment) with respect to, such Conveyed Interests.

(c) Buyer shall coordinate its access rights, environmental property
assessments and physical inspections of the Conveyed Interests with Seller and
all Third Party operators, as applicable, to minimize any inconvenience to or
interruption of the conduct of business by Seller or any such Third Party
operator. Buyer shall abide by Seller's, and any Third Party operator's,
safety rules, regulations and operating policies while conducting its due
diligence evaluation of the Conveyed Interests, including any environmental or
other inspection or assessment of the Conveyed Interests to the extent Buyer
receives copies of such rules, regulations and policies in advance of entering
upon the Conveyed Interests and, to the extent required by any Third Party
operator, execute and deliver any access and bonding agreement required by any
such Third Party operator, in each case before conducting Buyer's assessment
on such Conveyed Interest in accordance with this Section 4.1. Buyer hereby
indemnifies, defends, and holds harmless each of the operators of the Conveyed
Interests and each Seller Indemnified Party from and against any and all
Liabilities arising out of, resulting from or relating to any field visit,
environmental assessment or other due diligence activity conducted by Buyer or
any Buyer's Representative with respect to the Conveyed Interests, EVEN IF
SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE SOLE,
ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR
OTHER FAULT OF, OR THE VIOLATION OF LAW BY, A MEMBER OF THE



11

SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, EXCEPTING ONLY LIABILITIES TO THE EXTENT ACTUALLY
RESULTING FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY SUCH OPERATOR
OF THE CONVEYED INTERESTS OR A MEMBER OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES.

(d) Buyer acknowledges that any entry into Seller's offices or onto the
Conveyed Interests shall be at Buyer's sole risk, cost and expense, and,
subject to the terms hereof, that none of the Seller Indemnified Parties shall
be liable in any way for any injury, loss or damage arising out of such entry
that may occur to Buyer or any of Buyer's Representatives pursuant to this
Agreement. Buyer hereby fully waives and releases any and all Liabilities
against all of the Seller Indemnified Parties for any injury, death, loss or
damage to any of Buyer's Representatives or their property in connection with
Buyer's due diligence activities, EVEN IF SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR
RESULT FROM, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR
COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OF, OR THE VIOLATION
OF LAW BY, A MEMBER OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, EXCEPTING ONLY
LIABILITIES ACTUALLY RESULTING FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT
OF A MEMBER OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES.

(e) Upon written request, Buyer agrees to promptly provide Seller, but in no
event less than five days after receipt or creation thereof by Buyer or any of
Buyer's Representatives (including Buyer's environmental consulting or
engineering firm), copies of all final reports prepared by Buyer and/or any of
Buyer's Representatives, which contain data collected or generated from
Buyer's and/or any of Buyer's Representatives' due diligence with respect to
the Conveyed Interests, including all environmental and title reports. Seller
shall not be deemed by its receipt of said documents or otherwise to have made
any representation or warranty, express, implied or statutory, as to the
condition of the Conveyed Interests or to the accuracy of said documents or
the information contained therein.

(f) Upon completion of Buyer's due diligence, Buyer shall at its sole cost and
expense and without any cost or expense to Seller or any of its Affiliates (i)
repair all damage done to any Conveyed Interests in connection with Buyer's
and/or any of Buyer's Representatives' due diligence (including due diligence
conducted by Buyer's environmental consulting or engineering firm), (ii)
restore the Conveyed Interests to the approximate same condition as, or better
condition than, they were prior to commencement of any such due diligence, and
(iii) remove all equipment, tools or other property brought onto the Conveyed
Interests in connection with such due diligence. Any disturbance to the
Conveyed Interests (including the leasehold associated therewith) resulting
from such due diligence will be promptly corrected by Buyer at Buyer's sole
cost and expense.

(g) During all periods that Buyer and/or any of Buyer's Representatives
(including Buyer's environmental consulting or engineering firm) are on the
Conveyed Interests, Buyer shall maintain, at its sole cost and expense,
policies of insurance of the types and in the amounts reasonably necessary to
support Buyer's obligations under this Section 4.1.

4.2 Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges that, pursuant to its right of access
to the Records or the Conveyed Interests, Buyer and/or Buyer's Representatives
(including Buyer's environmental consulting or engineering firm) will become
privy to confidential and other information of Seller and/or Seller's
Affiliates and Buyer shall ensure that such confidential information (a) shall
not be used for any purpose other than in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (b) shall be held confidential by Buyer and
Buyer's Representatives (including Buyer's environmental consulting or
engineering firm) in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreements. If the Closing should occur, the foregoing confidentiality
restriction on Buyer, including the Confidentiality Agreements, shall
terminate as of the Closing Date (except as to (i) such portion of the
Conveyed Interests that are not conveyed to Buyer pursuant to the provisions
of this Agreement, (ii) the Excluded Assets, and (iii) information related to
Seller, Seller's Affiliates, or to any assets other than the Conveyed

ARTICLE V

TITLE MATTERS; CASUALTIES; TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

5.1 General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations. Except for the
special warranty of title set forth in the Assignment and the Deeds, and
without limiting Buyer's remedies for Title Defects set forth in this Article
V, Seller makes no warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or
otherwise, with respect to Seller's title to any of the Conveyed Interests,
and Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Buyer's sole remedy for any
defect of title, including any Title Defect, with respect to any of the
Conveyed Interests (a) before Closing,



14

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





shall be as set forth in Section 5.3 and (b) from and after Closing, shall be
pursuant to the special warranty of title set forth in the Assignment and the
Deeds.

5.2 Special Warranty. The Assignment and Mineral Deed delivered at Closing
will contain a special warranty of title with regard to the Oil and Gas
Properties and the Midstream Assets, as applicable, whereby Seller shall
warrant title to the Oil and Gas Properties and the Midstream Assets, as
applicable, unto Buyer against every Person whomsoever lawfully claiming or to
claim the same or any part thereof by, through or under Seller, but not
otherwise, subject, however, to the Permitted Encumbrances.

5.3 Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments.

(a) Title Defect Notices. On or before the Defect Claim Date, Buyer must
deliver claim notices to Seller meeting the requirements of this Section
5.3(a) (collectively, the "Title Defect Notices" and, individually, a "Title
Defect Notice") setting forth any matters which, in Buyer's reasonable
opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Buyer intends to assert as a Title
Defect pursuant to this Section 5.3(a). For all purposes of this Agreement and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall be deemed to have
waived, and Seller shall have no liability for, any Title Defect which Buyer
fails to assert as a Title Defect by a properly delivered Title Defect Notice
received by Seller on or before the Defect Claim Date; provided, however,
that, for purposes of Seller's special warranty of title set forth in the
Assignment, such waiver shall not apply to any matter that, prior to the
Defect Claim Date, is not discovered by any of Buyer's or any of its
Affiliates' employees, title attorneys, landmen or other title examiners while
conducting Buyer's title due diligence with respect to the Conveyed Interests.
To be effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing, and shall
include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect and the Conveyed
Interest (including the legal description of such Conveyed Interest and the
Leases applicable to such Conveyed Interest, if applicable), or portion
thereof (including by the Target Formation as applicable), affected by such
alleged Title Defect (each a "Title Defect Property"), (ii) the Allocated
Value of each Title Defect Property, (iii) supporting documents reasonably
necessary for Seller to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect, (iv)
Buyer's preferred manner of curing such Title Defect and (v) the amount by
which Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect
Property is reduced by such alleged Title Defect and the computations upon
which Buyer's belief is based. To give Seller an opportunity to commence
reviewing and curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to
give Seller, on or before the end of each calendar week prior to the Defect
Claim Date, written notice of all alleged Title Defects (as well as any claims
that would be claims under the special warranty set forth in the Assignment)
discovered by Buyer during the preceding calendar week, which notice may be
preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Defect Claim Date;
provided, however, that Buyer's failure to deliver such notices shall not
waive Buyer's right to notify Seller of Title Defects prior to the Defect
Claim Date. Buyer shall also, promptly upon discovery, furnish Seller with
written notice of any Title Benefit which is discovered by any of Buyer's or
any of its Affiliates' employees, title attorneys, landmen or other title
examiners while conducting Buyer's due diligence with respect to the Conveyed
Interests prior to the Defect Claim Date.

(b) Title Benefit Notices. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to deliver to Buyer on or before the Defect Claim Date with
respect to each Title Benefit a notice (a



15

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





"Title Benefit Notice") including (i) a description of the alleged Title
Benefit and the Oil and Gas Property, or portion thereof, affected by such
alleged Title Benefit (each a "Title Benefit Property"), and (ii) the amount
by which Seller reasonably believes the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit
Property is increased by such alleged Title Benefit, and the computations upon
which Seller's belief is based. Seller shall be deemed to have waived any
Title Benefit which Seller fails to assert as a Title Benefit by a Title
Benefit Notice delivered to Buyer on or before the Defect Claim Date. To give
Buyer an opportunity to commence reviewing Title Benefits, Seller agrees to
use reasonable efforts to give Buyer, on or before the end of each calendar
week prior to the Defect Claim Date, written notice of all alleged Title
Benefits discovered by Seller during the preceding calendar week, which notice
may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Defect Claim Date;
provided, however, that Seller's failure to deliver such notices shall not
waive Seller's right to notify Buyer of Title Benefits prior to the Defect
Claim Date.

(c) Seller's Right to Cure. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure any properly asserted Title
Defects at any time prior to 120 days after the Closing Date (the "Cure
Period"). During the period of time from Closing to the expiration of the Cure
Period, Buyer agrees to afford Seller and its officers, employees and other
authorized representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to
the Oil and Gas Properties and all Records in Buyer's or any of its
Affiliates' possession in order to facilitate Seller's attempt to cure any
such Title Defects. The Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount set
forth in Section 5.3(a)(v) with respect to any Title Defect for which Seller
has provided notice to Buyer prior to or on the Closing Date that Seller
intends to attempt to cure the Title Defect during the Cure Period. Buyer
shall remit the amount set forth in the preceding sentence to the Escrow Agent
on the Closing Date to be held pursuant to the Title and Environmental Defects
Escrow Agreement. Such amount plus interest earned thereon shall be paid to
Seller at the end of the Cure Period if the applicable Title Defect is cured.
If the applicable Title Defect is not cured at the end of the Cure Period,
then such amount plus interest earned thereon shall be paid to Buyer. Any
disputes regarding the sufficiency of any attempted curative action by Seller
shall be resolved in accordance with Section 5.3(j). An election by Seller to
attempt to cure a Title Defect shall be without prejudice to its rights under
Section 5.3(j) and shall not constitute an admission against interest or a
waiver of Seller's right to dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost
to cure, the alleged Title Defect.

(d) Remedies for Title Defects. Subject to Seller's continuing right to
dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount
asserted with respect thereto, and subject to the rights of the Parties
pursuant to Section 15.1(e), in the event that any Title Defect timely
asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 5.3(a) is not waived in writing
by Buyer or cured during the Cure Period, Seller shall, at its sole option,
but subject to Buyer's agreement in the case of the remedies described in
Section 5.3(d)(ii) and Section 5.3(d)(iii), elect to:

(i) subject to the Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Title Defect
Deductible, reduce the Purchase Price or the Final Price, as applicable, by
the Title Defect Amount determined pursuant to Section 5.3(g) or Section
5.3(j);

(ii) with the written consent of Buyer, retain the entirety of the Title
Defect Property that is subject to such Title Defect, together with all
associated Conveyed



16

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





Interests, or if the Title Defect Property has been assigned to Buyer, have
Buyer reassign to Seller, with special warranty of title against claims by,
through or under Buyer, but not otherwise, the Title Defect Property that is
subject to such Title Defect, together with all associated Conveyed Interests,
and, concurrently therewith, the Purchase Price or the Final Price, as
applicable, shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such
Title Defect Property and such associated Conveyed Interests;

(iii) if and only if Buyer agrees to this remedy in its sole discretion,
indemnify Buyer against all Liability (up to the Allocated Value of the
applicable Title Defect Property) resulting from such Title Defect with
respect to such Title Defect Property pursuant to an indemnity agreement
prepared by Seller in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer (a
"Title Indemnity Agreement"); or

(iv) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 15.1(e).

(e) Remedies for Title Benefits. With respect to each Title Benefit Property
reported under Section 5.3(b), the Purchase Price shall be increased by an
amount (the "Title Benefit Amount") equal to the increase in the Allocated
Value for such Title Benefit Property caused by such Title Benefit, as
determined pursuant to Section 5.3(h) or Section 5.3(j); provided, however,
that any such increase to the Purchase Price shall not exceed the absolute
value of any downward adjustments to the Purchase Price attributable to Title
Defects.

(f) Exclusive Remedy. Except for Buyer's rights arising under Seller's
representations and warranties in Section 7.20, Buyer's rights under Seller's
special warranty of title in the Assignment and Deeds delivered at Closing and
Buyer's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 15.1(e), Section
5.3(d) shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to
Seller's failure to have Defensible Title with respect to any Well, Well
Location, or Lease or any other title matter with respect to any Oil and Gas
Properties, and Buyer hereby waives any and all other rights or remedies with
respect thereto.

(g) Title Defect Amount. The amount by which the Allocated Value of a Title
Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of a Title Defect
shall be the "Title Defect Amount" for such Title Defect Property and shall be
determined in accordance with the following terms and conditions (without
duplication):

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated
in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be
paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) Seller's Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Defect Property in Exhibit G, then the Title
Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect
Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set
forth for such Title Defect Property in Exhibit G;



17

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





(iv) if the Title Defect arises under clause (b)(ii) of the definition of
Defensible Title, then the Title Defect Amount for that Title Defect Property
shall be the product of the total length (measured in Rods) of the portion of
the gathering pipelines affected by such Title Defect multiplied by an amount
equal to $300.00 per Rod.

(v) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Encumbrance upon or other
defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above,
then the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect
Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect,
the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title
Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller
and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation;

(vi) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

(vii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article V, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property.

(h) Title Benefit Amount. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title
Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions (without duplication):

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) Seller's Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property in Exhibit G, then the
Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title
Benefit Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net
Revenue Interest increase and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property in Exhibit G; and

(iii) if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the Title
Benefit Amounts shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value
of the Title Benefit Property, the portion of such Title Benefit Property
affected by such Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the
potential economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of such Title
Benefit Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and Seller
and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation.

(i) Title Defect Threshold and Deductible. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, subject to Section 5.6, (i) in no event shall there be any
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller
hereunder for any individual Title Defect for



18

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





which the Title Defect Amount does not exceed $50,000 ("Individual Title
Defect Threshold"); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustment to the
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller hereunder for any Title
Defect for which the Title Defect Amount exceeds the Individual Title Defect
Threshold unless (A) the amount of the sum of the aggregate Title Defect
Amounts of all such Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Defect
Threshold (but excluding any Title Defect Amounts attributable to Title
Defects cured by Seller or Title Defect Properties retained by or reassigned
to Seller, as applicable, pursuant to Section 5.3(d)(ii)), exceeds (B) the
Title Defect Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other applicable remedies available
hereunder, but only to the extent that the amount by which the aggregate
amount of such Title Defect Amounts exceeds the Title Defect Deductible. For
the avoidance of doubt, if Seller elects to retain any Title Defect Property
or to have Buyer reassign any Title Defect Property pursuant to Section
5.3(d)(ii), the Title Defect Amount relating to the Conveyed Interest
attributable to such Title Defect Property will not be counted towards the
Title Defect Deductible and will not be considered for purposes of Section
10.4 or Section 11.4.

(j) Title Dispute Resolution. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on
matters regarding (i) all Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts
and Title Benefit Amounts, and (ii) the adequacy of any curative materials
provided by Seller to cure any alleged Title Defect (collectively "Title
Disputes") prior to Closing. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by
Closing (or by the Title Dispute Date if Seller elects to attempt to cure an
alleged Title Defect after Closing), the Title Disputes shall be exclusively
and finally resolved pursuant to this Section 5.3(j). There shall be a single
arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at least 10 years' experience
in oil and gas or midstream titles, as applicable, involving properties in any
of the regional areas in which the Title Defect Properties or Title Benefit
Properties, as applicable, are located, in each case as selected by the mutual
agreement of Buyer and Seller within 15 days after Closing or the Title
Dispute Date, as applicable (the "Title Arbitrator"). If the Parties do not
mutually agree upon the Title Arbitrator in accordance with this Section
5.3(j), a tenured professor of oil and gas law at the University of Texas at
Austin School of Law shall appoint the Title Arbitrator under such conditions
as he in his sole discretion deems necessary or advisable; provided that he
must appoint someone (1) with at least 10 years' experience in oil and gas or
midstream titles, as applicable, involving properties in any of the regional
areas in which the Title Defect Properties or Title Benefit Properties, as
applicable, are located, (2) who has not been employed by either Party (or
their Affiliate) in the past ten years, and (3) who has no ethical conflict in
serving as the Title Arbitrator. If such tenured professor is unable or
unwilling to appoint the Title Arbitrator, a tenured professor of oil and gas
law at the Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law shall appoint
the Title Arbitrator, subject to the foregoing limitations. The place of
arbitration shall be Houston, and the arbitration shall be conducted in
accordance with the AAA Rules, to the extent such rules do not conflict with
the terms of this Section 5.3(j). The Title Arbitrator's determination shall
be made within 30 days after submission of Title Disputes and shall be final
and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his
determination with respect to any Title Dispute, the Title Arbitrator shall be
bound by the rules set forth in Section 5.3(g) and Section 5.3(h) and, subject
to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as, in the opinion of the
Title Arbitrator, are necessary to make a proper determination. The Title
Arbitrator, however, (i) may not award Buyer a greater Title Defect Amount
than the Title Defect Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Title Defect
Notice and (ii) may not award Seller a greater Title Benefit Amount than the
Title Benefit



19

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





Amount claimed by Seller in its applicable Title Benefit Notice. The Title
Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the
specific Title Disputes submitted by either Party, and the Title Arbitrator
may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to
any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other
costs of presenting its case to the Title Arbitrator. Each of Seller and Buyer
shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator. To the
extent the award of the Title Arbitrator with respect to any Title Defect
Amount or Title Benefit Amount is not taken into account as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.5 or Section 3.6, then within 10 days
after the Title Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of his
award with respect to a Title Dispute, and, subject to Section 5.3(d)(i), (i)
Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title
Arbitrator to Seller and (ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount, if any, so
awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Buyer. Nothing herein shall operate to
cause Closing to be delayed on account of any arbitration that may be
conducted pursuant to this Section 5.3(j), and, to the extent any adjustments
are not agreed upon by the Parties as of Closing, the Purchase Price shall not
be adjusted therefor at Closing and subsequent adjustments to the Purchase
Price, if any, will be made pursuant to Section 3.7 or this Section 5.3(j).

5.4 Casualty or Condemnation Loss.

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the
Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with
respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including
watering out of any well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any well)
and the depreciation of Personal Property due to ordinary wear and tear, in
each case, with respect to the Conveyed Interests, and Buyer shall not assert
such matters as Casualty Losses or Title Defects hereunder. Until Closing,
Seller shall maintain its current insurance policies relative to the Conveyed
Interests in all respects.

(b) If after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, (i) any portion
of the Conveyed Interests is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or
is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain (each, a "Casualty
Loss"), (ii) the Closing thereafter occurs and (iii) the estimated cost to
repair such Conveyed Interest (with equipment of similar utility) is greater
than $100,000, then Buyer shall not be obligated to purchase such Conveyed
Interest. If Buyer declines to purchase such Conveyed Interest, the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Conveyed Interest. If
Buyer elects to purchase such Conveyed Interest, the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the estimated cost to repair such Conveyed Interest (with equipment
of similar utility), less all insurance proceeds which Seller causes to be
paid or pays to Buyer, up to the Allocated Value thereof. Seller, at its sole
option, may elect to cure such Casualty Loss to Buyer's reasonable
satisfaction and, in such event, Seller shall be entitled to all insurance
proceeds. If Seller elects to cure such Casualty Loss, Seller may replace any
Personal Property that is the subject of a Casualty Loss with equipment of
similar grade, function, quality and utility. If Seller cures the Casualty
Loss to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction, Buyer shall purchase the affected
Conveyed Interest at Closing for the Allocated Value thereof.

(c) If after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, (i) a Casualty
Loss occurs, (ii) the Closing thereafter occurs and (iii) the estimated cost
to repair such Conveyed Interest (with equipment of similar utility) is less
than $100,000, Seller, at Closing,



20

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





shall pay to Buyer all sums actually paid to Seller by Third Parties by reason
of any Casualty Loss insofar as with respect to the Conveyed Interests and
shall assign, transfer and set over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of
Seller's right, title and interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid
awards, and other rights against Third Parties (excluding any Liabilities,
other than insurance claims, of or against any Seller Indemnified Party)
arising out of such Casualty Loss insofar as with respect to the Conveyed
Interests; provided, however, that Seller shall reserve and retain (and Buyer
shall assign to Seller) all right, title, interest and claims against Third
Parties for the recovery of Seller's costs and expenses incurred prior to
Closing in repairing such Casualty Loss and/or pursuing or asserting any such
insurance claims or other rights against Third Parties.

5.5 Preferential Purchase Rights and Consents to Assign.

(a) With respect to each Preferential Purchase Right set forth in Schedule
7.9, not later than 10 days after the Execution Date (and, with respect to
each Preferential Purchase Right that is not set forth in Schedule 7.9 but is
discovered by either Party after the Execution Date and before the Closing
Date, not later than five days after the discovery thereof), Seller shall send
to the holder of each such Preferential Purchase Right a notice in material
compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such Preferential
Purchase Right.

(i) If, prior to Closing, any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right notifies
Seller that it intends to consummate the purchase of the Conveyed Interest to
which its Preferential Purchase Right applies, then the Conveyed Interest
subject to such Preferential Purchase Right shall be excluded from the Oil and
Gas Properties to be assigned to Buyer at Closing (but only to the extent of
the portion of such Conveyed Interest affected by the Preferential Purchase
Right), and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the
Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof) so excluded. Seller shall be entitled
to all proceeds paid by any Person exercising a Preferential Purchase Right
prior to Closing. If such holder of such Preferential Purchase Right
thereafter fails to consummate the purchase of the Conveyed Interest (or
portion thereof) covered by such Preferential Purchase Right on or before the
end of the period of time for closing such sale but no later than 120 days
following the Closing Date, (A) Seller shall so notify Buyer, (B) Buyer shall
purchase, on or before 10 days following receipt of such notice, such Conveyed
Interest (or portion thereof) that was so excluded from the Conveyed Interests
to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, under the terms of this Agreement and for
a price equal to the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing
with respect to such excluded Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof), and (C)
Seller shall assign to Buyer the Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof) so
excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form
as the Assignment. If, as of Closing, the time for exercising a Preferential
Purchase Right has not expired and such Preferential Purchase Right has not
been exercised or waived, then the Conveyed Interest subject to such
Preferential Purchase Right shall be included in the Conveyed Interests to be
assigned to Buyer at Closing, and Buyer shall be solely responsible for
complying with the terms of such Preferential Purchase Right and shall be
entitled to the proceeds, if any, associated with the exercise of such
Preferential Purchase Right.



21

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





(ii) All Oil and Gas Properties for which any applicable Preferential Purchase
Right has been waived, or as to which the period to exercise the applicable
Preferential Purchase Right has expired, in each case, prior to Closing, shall
be sold to Buyer at Closing pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.

(b) With respect to each Consent set forth in Schedule 7.4, Seller, not later
than 10 days after the Execution Date (and, with respect to each Consent that
is not set forth in Schedule 7.4 but is discovered by either Party after the
Execution Date and before the Closing Date, not later than five days after the
discovery thereof), shall send to the holder of each such Consent a notice in
material compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such Consent
seeking such holder's consent to the transactions contemplated hereby.

(i) If (A) Seller fails to obtain a Consent set forth in Schedule 7.4 (or any
Consent that is not set forth in Schedule 7.4 but is discovered by either
Party after the Execution Date and before the Closing Date) prior to Closing
and the failure to obtain such Consent would cause (1) the assignment of the
Conveyed Interests affected thereby to Buyer to be void or voidable under the
terms thereof, (2) the termination of a Lease or other Conveyed Interest under
the express terms thereof or (3) the payment of liquidated damages under a
Lease or a Contract for assignment without obtaining consent or (B) a Consent
requested by Seller is denied in writing, then, in each case, the Conveyed
Interest (or portion thereof) affected by such un-obtained Consent shall be
excluded from the Conveyed Interests to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, and
the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Conveyed
Interest (or portion thereof) so excluded. In the event that any such Consent
(with respect to a Conveyed Interest excluded pursuant to this Section
5.5(b)(i)) that was not obtained prior to Closing is obtained within 180 days
following the Closing Date, then, within 10 Business Days after such Consent
is obtained, (x) Buyer shall purchase the Conveyed Interest (or portion
thereof) that was so excluded as a result of such previously un-obtained
Consent and pay to Seller the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced
at Closing with respect to the Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof) so
excluded and (y) Seller shall assign to Buyer the Conveyed Interest (or
portion thereof) so excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in
substantially the same form as the Assignment.

(ii) If Seller fails to obtain a Consent set forth in Schedule 7.4 (or any
Consent that is not set forth in Schedule 7.4 but is discovered by either
Party after the Execution Date and before the Closing Date) prior to Closing
and (A) the failure to obtain such Consent would not cause (1) the assignment
of the Conveyed Interest (or portion thereof) affected thereby to Buyer to be
void, (2) the termination of a Lease under the express terms thereof or (3)
the payment of liquidated damages under a Lease or a Contract for assignment
without obtaining consent and (B) such Consent requested by Seller is not
denied in writing by the holder thereof, then the Conveyed Interest (or
portion thereof) subject to such un-obtained Consent shall nevertheless be
assigned by Seller to Buyer at Closing as part of the Conveyed Interests and
Buyer shall have no claim against, and Seller shall have no Liability for, the
failure to obtain such Consent.

(iii) Prior to Closing, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain all Consents listed in Schedule 7.4 (and any Consent that is not set
forth



22

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





in Schedule 7.4 but is discovered by either Party after the Execution Date and
before the Closing Date); provided, however, that Seller shall not be required
to incur any Liability or pay any money in order to obtain any such Consent.
Subject to the foregoing, Buyer agrees to provide Seller with any information
or documentation that may be reasonably requested by Seller and/or the Third
Party holder(s) of such Consents in order to facilitate the process of
obtaining such Consents.

5.6 Acknowledged Title Defects

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller acknowledges that
the matters listed on Schedule 7.8 Part 2 (the "RRC Matters") constitute Title
Defects.

(b) To the extent Seller is unable to cure the Title Defect arising from the
RRC Matters fully prior to Closing, the Oil and Gas Property associated with
each uncured RRC Matter will be excluded from the Oil and Gas Properties to be
assigned to Buyer at Closing, and the Purchase Price will be reduced by the
Allocated Value of the Oil and Gas Property so excluded. This Purchase Price
reduction will be without regard to the Individual Title Defect Threshold or
the Title Defect Deductible and any Purchase Price reduction will not count
toward the Title Defect Deductible.

ARTICLE VI

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

6.1 Environmental Defects.

(a) Assertions of Environmental Defects. Buyer must deliver claim notices to
Seller meeting the requirements of this Section 6.1(a) (collectively the
"Environmental Defect Notices" and individually an "Environmental Defect
Notice") not later than the Defect Claim Date setting forth any matters which,
in Buyer's reasonable opinion, constitute Environmental Defects and which
Buyer intends to assert as Environmental Defects pursuant to this Section 6.1.
For all purposes of this Agreement except for Buyer's rights prior to Closing
with respect to breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 7.20, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller shall have no
liability for, any Environmental Defect which Buyer fails to assert as an
Environmental Defect by a properly delivered Environmental Defect Notice
received by Seller on or before the Defect Claim Date, with such liabilities
being "Buyer's Environmental Liabilities." To be effective, each Environmental
Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a description of the
matter constituting the alleged Environmental Condition (including the
applicable Environmental Law violated or implicated thereby) and the Conveyed
Interests affected by such alleged Environmental Condition, (ii) the Allocated
Value of the Conveyed Interests (or portions thereof) affected by such alleged
Environmental Condition, (iii) supporting documents reasonably necessary for
Seller to verify the existence of such alleged Environmental Condition, and
(iv) a calculation of the Remediation Amount (itemized in reasonable detail)
that Buyer asserts is attributable to such alleged Environmental Condition.
Buyer's calculation of the Remediation Amount included in the Environmental
Defect Notice must describe in reasonable detail the Remediation proposed for
the alleged Environmental Condition that gives rise to the asserted
Environmental Defect and identify all assumptions used by Buyer in calculating
the Remediation Amount, including the standards that Buyer asserts must



23

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





be met to comply with Environmental Laws. Seller shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to cure any asserted Environmental Defect on or before the
expiration of the Cure Period. The Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
amount set forth in Section 6.1(b)(iv) with respect to any asserted
Environmental Defect for which Seller has provided notice to Buyer prior to or
on the Closing Date that Seller intends to attempt to cure the asserted
Environmental Defect during the Cure Period. Buyer shall remit the amount set
forth in the preceding sentence to the Escrow Agent on the Closing Date to be
held pursuant to the Title and Environmental Defects Escrow Agreement. Such
amount plus interest earned thereon shall be paid to Seller at the end of the
Cure Period if the applicable Environmental Defect is cured. If the applicable
Environmental Defect is not cured at the end of the Cure Period, then such
amount plus interest earned thereon shall be paid to Buyer. Any disputes
regarding the sufficiency of any attempted curative action by Seller shall be
resolved in accordance with Section 6.1(e). To give Seller an opportunity to
commence reviewing and curing Environmental Defects, Buyer agrees to use
reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before the end of each calendar week
prior to the Defect Claim Date, written notice of all alleged Environmental
Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding calendar week, which notice
may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Defect Claim Date;
provided, however, that Buyer's failure to deliver such notices shall not
waive Buyer's right to notify Seller of Environmental Defects prior to the
Defect Claim Date.

(b) Remedies for Environmental Defects. Subject to Seller's continuing right
to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect and/or the Remediation
Amount asserted with respect thereto, and subject to the rights of the Parties
pursuant to Section 15.1(e), in the event that any Environmental Defect timely
asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 6.1(a) is not waived in writing
by Buyer or cured during the Cure Period, Seller shall, at its sole option but
subject to Buyer's agreement in the case of the remedy described in Section
6.1(b)(ii) or Section 6.1(b)(iii), elect to:

(i) subject to the Individual Environmental Threshold and the Aggregate
Deductible, reduce the Purchase Price by the Remediation Amount;

(ii) with the written consent of Buyer, retain the entirety of the Conveyed
Interest that is subject to such Environmental Defect, together with all
associated Conveyed Interests, or if the Environmental Defect Property has
been assigned to Buyer, have Buyer reassign to Seller, with special warranty
of title against claims by, through or under Buyer, in which event the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
such Conveyed Interest and such associated Conveyed Interests;

(iii) if and only if Buyer agrees to this remedy in its sole discretion, to
indemnify Buyer against all Liability resulting from such Environmental Defect
with respect to the Conveyed Interests pursuant to an indemnity agreement
prepared by Seller in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer
(each, an "Environmental Indemnity Agreement"); or

(iv) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 15.1(e).



24

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





If Seller elects the option set forth in clause (i) above, Buyer shall be
deemed to have assumed responsibility for all of the costs and expenses
attributable to the Remediation of the Environmental Condition attributable to
such Environmental Defect and for all Liabilities with respect thereto and
Buyer's obligations with respect to the foregoing shall be deemed to
constitute Assumed Obligations.

(c) Exclusive Remedy. Except for Seller's representations in Section 7.20 and
Buyer's rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 15.1(e), the
provisions set forth in Section 6.1(b) shall be the exclusive right and remedy
of Buyer with respect to any Environmental Defect with respect to any Conveyed
Interest or other environmental matter.

(d) Environmental Deductibles. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustment to the Purchase Price
or other remedies provided by Seller for any individual Environmental Defect
for which the Remediation Amount does not exceed $100,000 (the "Individual
Environmental Threshold"); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustment
to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any
Environmental Defect for which the Remediation Amount exceeds the Individual
Environmental Threshold unless (A) the amount of the aggregate Remediation
Amounts of all such Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual
Environmental Threshold (but excluding any Remediation Amounts attributable to
any Environmental Defects cured by Seller and Conveyed Interests retained by
Seller pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(ii)), exceeds (B) the Environmental Defect
Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the
Purchase Price or other applicable remedies available hereunder, but only with
respect to the amount by which the aggregate amount of such Remediation
Amounts exceeds the Environmental Defect Deductible. For the avoidance of
doubt, if Seller elects to retain any Conveyed Interest related to any
Environmental Defect pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(ii), then (x) the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such retained Conveyed
Interest and (y) the Remediation Amount for the Environmental Defect relating
to such retained Conveyed Interest will not be counted towards the
Environmental Defect Deductible.

(e) Environmental Dispute Resolution. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree
on all Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts prior to Closing. If
Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by Closing, the Environmental Defects
and/or Remediation Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally
resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Section 6.1(e). There shall be a
single arbitrator, who shall be an environmental attorney with at least 10
years' experience in environmental matters involving oil and gas producing
properties or midstream properties, as applicable, in any of the regional
areas in which the affected Conveyed Interests are located, as selected by the
mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within 15 days after the Closing Date
(the "Environmental Arbitrator"). If the Parties do not mutually agree upon
the Environmental Arbitrator in accordance with this Section 6.1(e), a tenured
professor of oil and gas law at the University of Texas at Austin School of
Law shall appoint the Environmental Arbitrator under such conditions as he in
his sole discretion deems necessary or advisable; provided however that he
must appoint someone (1) who is an environmental attorney with at least 10
years' experience in environmental matters involving oil and gas producing
properties or midstream properties, as applicable, in any of the regional
areas in which the affected Conveyed Interests are located (2) who has not
been employed by either Party (or their Affiliate) in the past ten years, and
(3) who has no ethical conflict in serving as the Title Arbitrator. If such
tenured



25

* * *





professor is unable or unwilling to appoint the Environmental Arbitrator, a
tenured professor of oil and gas law at the Southern Methodist University
Dedman School of Law shall appoint the Environmental Arbitrator. The place of
arbitration shall be Houston, and the arbitration shall be conducted in
accordance with the AAA Rules, to the extent such rules do not conflict with
the terms of this Section 6.1(e). The Environmental Arbitrator's determination
shall be made within 30 days after submission of the matters in dispute and
shall be final and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In
making his determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the
rules set forth in this Section 6.1 and, subject to the foregoing, may
consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator
are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. The Environmental
Arbitrator, however, may not award Buyer a greater Remediation Amount than the
Remediation Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Environmental Defect
Notice. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental Defects and/or
Remediation Amounts submitted by either Party and may not award damages,
interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Seller and
Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its
case to the Environmental Arbitrator. Each of Seller and Buyer shall bear one-
half of the costs and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator. To the extent
that the award of the Environmental Arbitrator with respect to any Remediation
Amount is not taken into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 3.5 or Section 3.6, then within ten 10 days after the
Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of his
award with respect to any Remediation Amount, and, subject to Section 6.1(d),
(i) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, so awarded by the
Environmental Arbitrator to Seller and (ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer the
amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator to Buyer. Nothing
herein shall operate to cause Closing to be delayed on account of any
arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section 6.1(e), and, to the extent any
adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties as of Closing, the Purchase
Price shall not be adjusted therefor at Closing and subsequent adjustments to
the Purchase Price, if any, will be made pursuant to Section 3.7 or this
Section 6.1(e).

6.2 NORM, Asbestos, Wastes and Other Substances. Buyer acknowledges that the
Conveyed Interests have been used for exploration, development, and production
of oil and gas and that there may be petroleum, produced water, wastes, or
other substances or materials located in, on or under the Conveyed Interests
or associated with the Conveyed Interests. Equipment and sites included in the
Conveyed Interests may contain asbestos, NORM or other Hazardous Substances.
NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials, and
equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials, and equipment
located on the Conveyed Interests or included in the Conveyed Interests may
contain asbestos, NORM and other wastes or Hazardous Substances. NORM
containing material and/or other wastes or Hazardous Substances may have come
in contact with various environmental media, including water, soils or
sediment. Special procedures may be required for the assessment, remediation,
removal, transportation, or disposal of any affected environmental media,
wastes, asbestos, NORM and other Hazardous Substances from the Conveyed
Interests. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not be
permitted to claim any Environmental Defect on the account of the presence of
NORM or asbestos-containing materials that are non-friable, unless and only to
the extent such presence of NORM or asbestos-containing materials that are
non‑friable constitutes an Environmental Condition resulting in a violation of
Environmental



26

Laws or to the extent such NORM or asbestos-containing material is present on
out of service surface equipment included in the Conveyed Interests.

and all suits, legal or administrative proceedings, claims, demands, damages,

Agreement, the ownership, use or operation of any of the Conveyed Interests
prior to Closing or the condition, quality, status or nature of any of the

implied warranties, nuisance or other tort actions, rights to punitive
damages, common law rights of contribution and rights under insurance
maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates (except as provided in Section
5.4).

13.7 Indemnification Procedures. All claims for indemnification under Sections
4.1(c), 9.5, 13.2 and 13.3 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of Section 4.1(c), Section 9.5 and this Article XIII, the
term "Indemnifying Party" when used in connection with particular Liabilities
shall mean the Party or Parties having an obligation to indemnify another
Party and/or other Person(s) with respect to such Liabilities pursuant to
Section 4.1(c), Section 9.5 or this Article XIII, and the term "Indemnified
Party" when used in connection with particular Liabilities shall mean the
Party and/or other Person(s) having the right to be indemnified with respect
to such Liabilities by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 4.1(c),
Section9.5 or this Article XIII.

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under Sections 4.1(c), 9.5, 13.2 or
13.3, an Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of
its claim under this Section 13.7, including the specific details of and
specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the "Claim Notice"). In the
event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third
Party against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified
Party shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has
actual knowledge of the Third Party Claim and shall enclose a copy of all
papers (if any) served with respect to the Third Party Claim; provided that
the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice of a Third Party Claim as
provided in this Section 13.7(b) shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations under Sections 4.1(c), 9.5, 13.2 or 13.3 (as applicable)
except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time being available
to permit the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Third Party
Claim or otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability to
defend against the Third Party Claim. In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or
breached.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice
to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its obligation to
defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is
authorized, prior to and during such 30-day period, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall
deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its obligation to defend and indemnify
the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, it shall have the right and
obligation to



47

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





diligently defend and indemnify, at its sole cost and expense, the Indemnified
Party against such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have full
control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party agrees to cooperate in contesting any Third Party Claim which the
Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may participate
in, but not control, at its own expense, any defense or settlement of any
Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Section 13.7(d). An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent
of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect thereto which does not include an
unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party from all Liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim or (ii) settle any Third Party Claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto in any manner that
may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a
result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against a Third Party
Claim, but fails to diligently prosecute, indemnify against or settle such
Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend
against the Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, with counsel of the Indemnified Party's choosing, subject to the right
of the Indemnifying Party to admit its liability and assume the defense of the
Third Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination
thereof. If the Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its obligation to
defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any
proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for 10
days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation
to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the liability and consent
to such settlement, (ii) if liability is so admitted, reject, in its
reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement, or (iii) deny liability. Any
failure by the Indemnifying Party to respond to such notice shall be deemed to
be an election under subsection (i) above.

13.8 Survival.

(a) SELLER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN SECTION 7.20 WILL NOT SURVIVE
CLOSING AND BUYER RECOGNIZES THAT IT WILL HAVE NO REMEDY OR RECOURSE WITH
RESPECT TO SECTION 7.20 AFTER CLOSING.

(b) Except for the Specified Representations, the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 7.20, the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 7.13 and the special warranty of title included in the
Assignment and Deeds, the representations and warranties of Seller in Article
VII and Buyer in Article VIII and the covenants and agreements of the Parties
in Section 9.1 and Section 12.4, shall in each case terminate on the date that
is 12 calendar months from the Closing Date. The Specified Representations
shall survive Closing without time limit. The representations and warranties
set forth in Sections 7.13 and 7.18 shall survive until 30 days after the
expiration of the period of time set forth in the applicable statute of
limitations. The special warranty of title included in the Assignment shall
survive for the period set forth in the Assignment. Subject to the foregoing
and as set forth in Section 13.8(c), the remainder of this Agreement shall
survive Closing without time limit. Representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements shall be of no further force or effect after the date of their



48

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





expiration, provided that there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim
asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its expiration date.

(c) The indemnities in Sections 13.2(a), 13.2(b), 13.3(a) and 13.3(b) shall
terminate as of the termination date of each respective representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to indemnification. Seller's
indemnities set forth in Section 13.2(c) shall survive the Closing for a
period of five years from the Closing Date; provided, however, that (i)
Seller's indemnities set forth in Section 13.2(c) relating to the portions of
the Specified Obligations defined in items (v) and (vi) of Section 13.1(b)
shall survive until 30 days after the expiration of the period of time set
forth in the statute of limitations regarding same and Seller's indemnities
set forth in Section 13.2(c) relating to the portions of the Specified
Obligations defined in items (i), (iv), (vii), and (viii) of Section 13.1(b)
shall survive without time limit. Buyer's indemnity set forth in Sections
4.1(c), 9.5 and 13.3(c) shall survive the Closing without time limit and shall
be deemed covenants running with the Conveyed Interests (provided that each
Buyer and its successors and assigns shall not be released from any of, and
shall remain severally and not jointly liable to the Seller Indemnified
Parties for, the obligations and Liabilities of Buyer under such Sections of
this Agreement upon any transfer or assignment of any Conveyed Interest).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no termination of any bona fide
claim asserted pursuant to the indemnities in Sections 13.2(a) and 13.2(b) or
Sections 13.3(a) through 13.3(c) prior to the date of termination for such
indemnity.

13.9 Non-Compensatory Damages. None of the Buyer Indemnified Parties nor
Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from Seller or Buyer,
or their respective Affiliates, any indirect, consequential, punitive,
exemplary, remote or speculative damages or damages for lost profits of any
kind arising under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, except to the extent any such Party suffers such damages
to a Third Party, which damages (including costs of defense and reasonable
attorneys' fees incurred in connection with defending against such damages)
shall not be excluded by this provision as to recovery hereunder. Subject to
the preceding sentence, Buyer, on behalf of each of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, and Seller, on behalf of each of the Seller Indemnified Parties,
waive any right to recover punitive, special, indirect, exemplary, or
consequential damages, remote or speculative, or damages for lost profits of
any kind, arising in connection with or with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

13.10 Waiver of Right to Rescission. Seller and Buyer acknowledge that,
following Closing, the payment of money, as limited by the terms of this
Agreement, shall be adequate compensation for breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein or for any other claim
arising in connection with or with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. As the payment of money shall be adequate compensation,
following Closing, Buyer and Seller waive any right to rescind this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

13.11 Insurance. The amount of any Liabilities for which any of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or in
connection with or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be reduced by any corresponding insurance proceeds from
insurance policies carried by Buyer actually realized or



49

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





that could reasonably be expected to be actually realized by Buyer if a claim
were properly pursued under the relevant insurance arrangements.

13.12 Disclaimer of Application of Anti-Indemnity Statutes. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the provisions of any anti-indemnity statute
relating to oilfield services and associated activities shall not be
applicable to this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby.

ARTICLE XIV

EMPLOYMENT MATTERS

14.1 Seller Benefit Plans. Buyer shall not assume any of the Seller Benefit
Plans. From and after the Employee Start Date, Seller and its ERISA Affiliates
shall retain and shall be solely responsible for all obligations and
liabilities under the Seller Benefit Plans, and neither Buyer nor its
Affiliates shall have any obligation, liability or responsibility from and
after the Employee Start Date to or under the Seller Benefit Plans, whether
such obligation, liability or responsibility arose before, on or after the
Employee Start Date. Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its
Affiliates with respect to all claims and Liabilities relating to or arising
out of the Seller Benefit Plans.

14.2 Pre-Employee Start Date Claims under Seller Benefit Plans. To the extent
that an Available Employee was a participant in a Seller Benefit Plan, Seller
shall ensure that the Seller Benefit Plans are responsible for providing
welfare benefits (including medical, hospital, dental, accidental death and
dismemberment, life, disability and other similar benefits) to all
participating Available Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries for
all claims incurred prior to the Employee Start Date, subject to the generally
applicable terms and conditions of such plans. For purposes of this Section
14.2, a claim is incurred with respect to (i) accidental death and
dismemberment, disability, life and other similar benefits when the event
giving rise to such claim occurred and (ii) medical, hospital, dental and
other similar benefits when the services with respect to such claim are
rendered. Seller shall pay out all accrued and unused vacation balances of the
Continuing Employees, and all other compensation or remuneration due under
applicable Law within thirty (30) days of the Employee Start Date in
accordance with Seller's applicable policies in effect at that time or sooner
if required by applicable Law.

14.3 Available Employees' Offers and Post- Employee Start Date Employment and
Benefits. No later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the Execution
Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer (i) a letter that includes a list of all
Available Employees (the "Employee Letter") and (ii) a letter that includes a
list of all independent contractors who provide significant services with
respect to the Conveyed Interests. Buyer shall have thirty (30) days after
receipt of the Employee Letter within which to interview Available Employees
for possible employment with Buyer or its Affiliate. Buyer shall have no
obligation under this Agreement or otherwise to offer to employ any Available
Employee. The Employee Letter shall include the Available Employee Information
with respect to each Available Employee. Buyer shall:

(a) Within ten (10) Business Days before the anticipated Closing Date, make
written offers of employment to each of the Available Employees selected for
hire by Buyer in its sole discretion (the "Offered Employees"), with such
offers providing such Available Employees



50

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





at least five (5) Business Days to either accept or reject such offers,
provided, however, that any such written offers of employment to Available
Employees at the Wheeler, Texas location of Seller shall be made by no later
than October 24, 2014;

(b) no later than the date that is three (3) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, Buyer shall notify Seller as to each Offered
Employee who, as of such date, has accepted employment with Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (the "Continuing Employees"), which acceptance shall be
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing and effective as of the
Employee Start Date and may be conditioned on other typical hiring policies,
and each Offered Employee who, as of such date, has rejected Buyer's offer of
employment;

(c) indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates with respect to all
claims and Liabilities relating to or arising solely out of Buyer's employee
selection and employment offer process described in this Section 14.3
(including any claim of discrimination or other illegality in such selection
and offer process);

(d) (i) initially provide to each Continuing Employee base salary/wage rate
and cash bonus opportunities that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the base salary and cash bonus opportunities provided to
similarly situated employees of Buyer or its Affiliate; provided that nothing
in this Agreement shall affect the right of Buyer and its Affiliates to
terminate the employment of a Continuing Employee for any reason or at any
time; and provided further that neither Buyer nor its Affiliate shall be
required to provide compensation or benefits in the form of defined benefit
pension benefits, retiree medical benefits, or equity compensation, and (ii)
provide severance benefits for each Continuing Employee who is terminated by
Buyer or its Affiliate without cause (as defined in Exhibit K) during the
twelve (12) month period immediately following the Employee Start Date
equivalent to the severance benefits available under Exhibit K; provided,
however, that no such severance shall be payable unless such Continuing
Employee whose employment has been so terminated timely signs and does not
revoke as permitted by applicable Law a general release agreement in a form
provided by Buyer or its Affiliate;

(e) make reasonable efforts to cause the waiver of all limitations as to
pre‑existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees
under the group health plans of Buyer or its Affiliates; and

(f) provide full service credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting (other
than to the extent that such credit would result in duplication of benefits
with respect to the same period of service, and excepting credit for Buyer's
long term equity compensation plan) under all vacation, incentive,
compensation and employee benefit plans, policies and arrangements made
available to Continuing Employees by Buyer or any of its Affiliates on or
after the Employee Start Date to the same extent such Continuing Employee's
service was recognized under the corresponding type of benefit plans in which
such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Employee Start
Date, including the severance benefit determinations.

14.4 Savings Plans. Buyer shall cause the defined contribution pension plan
(or plans) and trust (or trusts) intended to qualify under Sections 401(a) and
501(a) of the Code maintained



51

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





by Buyer in which the Continuing Employees are eligible to participate to
accept the direct rollover of electing Continuing Employees' benefits in cash
and, if applicable and subject to the terms of such Buyer plans, promissory
notes from the Seller Savings Plan; provided that such direct rollover
qualifies as an "eligible rollover distribution" under Section 402(c) of the
Code.

14.5 Post- Employee Start Date Employment Claims. Buyer shall indemnify,
defend and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless from and against any and
all Liability of any kind or nature involving or related to the employment of
the Continuing Employees by Buyer, including any Liability related to any
employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates.
Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Buyer and its Affiliates harmless from
and against any and all Liability of any kind or nature or related to the
employment of any Available Employee who does not become a Continuing
Employee. Any Offered Employee who rejects Buyer's offer of employment as set
forth in Section 14.3 shall remain an employee of LOI. All Continuing
Employees shall remain employed by LOI between the Closing Date until the
Employee Start Date.

14.6 COBRA. Seller acknowledges and agrees that Seller shall be solely liable,
and that Buyer and its Affiliates shall have no obligation, responsibility or
Liability, for providing continuation coverage under and complying with
Section 4980B of the Code, Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA, and any state
health care continuation coverage laws with respect to any individual who
either prior to, on or after the Closing Date experienced a loss of coverage
under any group health plan contributed to or maintained by Seller or its
ERISA Affiliates, or who will otherwise be an "MandA Qualified Beneficiary" (as
such phrase is defined in Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-4 of the Treasury
Regulations) in connection with the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. Seller agrees to provide continuing health benefit coverage as
described in Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA
(hereinafter referred to as "COBRA Coverage") to all employees who are MandA
Qualified Beneficiaries with respect to the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement (hereinafter referred to as "COBRA Beneficiaries"). Specifically,
Seller agrees that all obligations to provide COBRA Coverage to COBRA
Beneficiaries are being allocated to and shall remain with Seller, as
permitted by QandA-7 of the Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9. If Seller
and its ERISA Affiliates ceases to maintain a group health plan and Seller's
obligation to provide COBRA Coverage to COBRA Beneficiaries shifts to Buyer or
its Affiliate as a result of Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-8(b)
or (c), then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for any and all costs and expenses
which Buyer or its Affiliate incurs in providing or otherwise making available
COBRA Coverage to COBRA Beneficiaries (including, but not limited to, claims,
administrative costs, fees, insurance premiums, insurance premium increases,
etc.). Buyer will invoice Seller monthly with respect to such expenses and
Seller shall be obligated to make full payment of each such invoice within
fifteen (15) business days of the date of such invoice and, if Seller shall
fail to timely pay the amounts of such invoices, Seller shall also be
obligated to pay interest with respect to the unpaid amounts at the rate of
ten percent (10%) per annum.

14.7 WARN Act. From the date of this Agreement until the Employee Start Date,
Seller shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to terminate the
employment of any Available Employees such that a "plant closing" or "mass
layoff" (as those terms are defined in the WARN Act or any similar state Law)
occurs prior to the Employee Start Date without complying with



52

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





the WARN Act. Buyer agrees to provide any notice required under the WARN Act
or any similar state Law with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff"
affecting Continuing Employees that may occur on or after the Employee Start
Date. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless from and against
any liability, damages, fines or costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
under the WARN Act or any similar state Law for any "plant closing" or "mass
layoff" affecting any Continuing Employee on or after the Employee Start Date
or arising, in whole or in part, from the actions (or inactions) of Buyer on
or after the Employee Start Date. Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold
Buyer harmless from and against any liability, damages, fines or costs
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) under the WARN Act or any similar state
Law for any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" occurring prior to the Employee
Start Date or arising, in whole or in part, from the actions (or inactions) of
Seller prior to the Employee Start Date.

14.8 No Third Party Beneficiary Rights. Nothing herein, expressed or implied,
shall confer upon any Available Employees (or any of their beneficiaries or
alternate payees) any rights or remedies (including any right to employment or
continued employment, or any right to compensation or benefits for any period)
of any nature or kind whatsoever, under or by reason of this Agreement or
otherwise. In addition, the provisions of this Article XIV, are for the sole
benefit of the Parties and are not for the benefit of any Third Party. Nothing
in this Article XIV, express or implied, shall be deemed to create any
employee benefit plan or amend any employee benefit plan, or be construed to
prevent Buyer, Seller, or any of their respective Affiliates from terminating
or modifying to any extent or in any respect any employee benefit plan.
Nothing in this Article XIV shall: (i) grant any rights or benefits to any
Person other than Buyer, Seller, and their respective Affiliates or (ii)
amend, or may be construed as amending, any employee benefit plan.

14.9 Non-Solicitation of Employees. Beginning on the Closing Date and until
the date that is one (1) year from the Closing Date, (i) Buyer shall not
solicit for hire, and shall cause its Affiliates not to solicit for hire
(without Seller's prior written consent) any Available Employee to whom Buyer
does not make an offer of employment as described in Section 14.3; and (ii)
Buyer shall not solicit for hire, and shall cause its Affiliates not to
solicit for hire (without Seller's prior written consent) any LOI employee
whose employment location is at Seller's headquarters or Seller's Oklahoma
City office and whose principal responsibility prior to Closing related to the
Conveyed Interests or who are or were directly or indirectly engaged the
negotiation or the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Beginning on the applicable Employee Start Date and until the date that is one
(1) year from such Employee Start Date, Seller shall not employ, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to employ (without Buyer's prior written consent) any
Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 14.9 shall
not prohibit (x) any solicitation that consists of a general advertisement or
solicitation by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, through the use of media
advertisements, the Internet, or professional search firms that is not
targeted at employees of LOI or Buyer or their respective Affiliates, as
applicable, or (y) any hiring of any person who is no longer employed by LOI
or Buyer or their respective Affiliates, as applicable.

(d) To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is not determinable at the
Closing or at the time of the determination of the Final Settlement Statement
pursuant to Section 3.6, as applicable, (i) the Parties shall utilize the most
recent information available in estimating the amount of such Asset Tax for
purposes of such adjustment, and (ii) upon the later determination of the
actual amount of such Asset Tax, timely payments will be made from one Party
to the other to the extent necessary to cause each Party to bear the amount of
such Asset Tax that is allocable to such Party under Section 16.2(b). Buyer
shall be responsible for the preparation and timely filing of any Tax Returns
and the payment to the applicable Taxing Authority of all Asset Taxes that
become due and payable on or after the Closing Date, and Buyer shall indemnify
and hold Seller harmless for any failure to file such Tax Returns and to make
such payments.

(e) All required documentary, filing and recording fees and expenses in
connection with the filing and recording of the assignments, conveyances or
other instruments required to convey title to the Conveyed Interests to Buyer
shall be borne by Buyer. Any and all sales, use, transfer, stamp, documentary,
registration or similar Taxes incurred or imposed with respect to the
transactions described in this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes")
shall be borne by Buyer, provided that Seller shall pay or cause to be paid to
the applicable Governmental Authorities any Transfer Taxes that it is required
by law to collect and remit. Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless
from and against such Transfer Taxes within thirty (30) days of Seller\'s
written demand therefor. If Seller (not Buyer) is required by applicable law
to appeal or protest the assessment of Transfer Taxes, the appeal or protest
of such proposed assessment shall be treated as an item for which Seller is
entitled to indemnification and if Buyer provides a written request and
instructs Seller to do so, Seller shall prosecute the protest or appeal; in
such event Buyer shall pay all out-of-pocket expenses of Seller (including
attorneys' fees) incurred by Seller in connection with such appeal or protest.
Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the
extent permissible under applicable law, the amount of any such Transfer
Taxes.

(f) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and
any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes relating to
the Conveyed Interests. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
another Party's request) the provision of records and information that are
relevant to any such Tax Return or audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided under this
Agreement. The Parties agree to retain all books

and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Conveyed Interests
relating to any Tax period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations of the respective Tax periods and to
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental
Authority.

16.3 Assignment. Subject to the provisions of Section 16.18, this Agreement
may not be assigned by Buyer without the prior written consent of Seller;
provided, however, at any time prior to three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer may, by written notice to Seller, direct Seller to assign
Buyer's interest in this Agreement or all or a portion of the Conveyed
Interests and Assumed Obligations to one or more Affiliates of Buyer. Such
assignment shall not relieve Buyer of any obligations and responsibilities
hereunder, including obligations and responsibilities arising following such
assignment. Any assignment or other transfer by Buyer or its successors and
assigns of any of the Conveyed Interests shall not relieve Buyer or its
successors or assigns of any of their obligations (including indemnity
obligations) hereunder, as to the Conveyed Interests so assigned or
transferred.

16.4 Preparation of Agreement. Both Seller and Buyer and their respective
counsel participated in the preparation of this Agreement. In the event of any
ambiguity in this Agreement, no presumption shall arise based on the identity
of the draftsman of this Agreement.

16.5 Publicity. Seller and Buyer shall promptly consult with each other with
regard to all press releases or other public or private announcements issued
or made at or prior to Closing concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein, and, except as may be required by applicable Laws or the
applicable rules and regulations of any Governmental Authority or stock
exchange, neither Buyer nor Seller shall issue any such press release or other

invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
adverse manner to either Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the Parties

original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

and Buyer may elect to treat the acquisition or sale of the Conveyed Interests
as an exchange of like‑kind property under Section 1031 of the Code (an
"Exchange") by providing written notice prior to the Closing Date, provided
that the Closing shall not be delayed by reason of the Exchange. Each Party

completion of such an Exchange including an Exchange subject to the procedures
outlined in Treasury Regulation § 1.1031(k)-1 and/or Internal Revenue Service
Revenue Procedure 2000-37. Each of Seller and Buyer shall have the right at
any time prior to Closing to assign all or a part of its rights under this

(as that term is defined in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure
2000-37) to effect an Exchange. In connection with any such Exchange, any
exchange accommodation titleholder



62

HOU:3475670.13

* * *





shall have taken all steps necessary to own the Conveyed Interests under
applicable Law. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that neither an assignment
of a Party's rights under this Agreement nor any other actions taken by a
Party or any other Person in connection with the Exchange shall release either
Party from, or modify, any of its liabilities and obligations (including
indemnity obligations to the other Party) under this Agreement, and neither
Party makes any representations as to any particular Tax treatment that may be
afforded to any other Party by reason of such assignment or any other actions
taken in connection with the Exchange. Either Party electing to treat the
acquisition or sale of the Conveyed Interests as an Exchange shall be
obligated to pay all additional costs incurred hereunder as a result of the
Exchange, and in consideration for the cooperation of the other Party, the
Party electing Exchange treatment shall agree to pay all costs associated with
the Exchange and to indemnify and hold the other Party, its Affiliates, and
their respective former, current and future partners, members, shareholders,
owners, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all liabilities and Taxes arising out of,
based upon, attributable to or resulting from the Exchange or transactions or
actions taken in connection with the Exchange that would not have been
incurred by the other Party but for the electing Party's Exchange election.

16.19 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that if any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed by Seller in accordance with their specific
terms, Buyer shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in
addition to any other remedy available at law or in equity.

Agreement, the Parties agree that each Buyer shall be severally, but not
jointly, liable (each for its Proportionate Share) for Buyer's obligations and
liabilities under this Agreement.
