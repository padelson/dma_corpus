Sections 2.5.2 through 2.5.5.

2.5.2. Closing Balance Sheet, Closing Cash on Hand, Closing Indebtedness and
Sellers' Transaction Expenses. As promptly as practicable, but in any event
within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Crane will prepare or cause to
be prepared in good faith, and will provide to the Sellers' Representatives, a
consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries as of the Balance Sheet Time (the "Closing Balance Sheet"),
together with a written statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth in
reasonable detail Crane's proposed determinations of Working Capital as of the
Balance Sheet Time and Cash on Hand, Indebtedness and Sellers' Transaction
Expenses, in each case as of the Balance Sheet Time (provided, however, that
for the avoidance of any doubt, items of Indebtedness with respect to amounts
paid at Closing pursuant to Section 2.4.1(f) shall not be less than the
amounts set forth in the payoff letters delivered with respect thereto) as
derived from the Closing Balance Sheet in accordance with the Accounting
Principles and the methodology used in the Example Calculations. The Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement will be prepared in accordance with
the Accounting Principles and the methodology used in the Example Calculations
on a basis and in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Statement, it being agreed
that in the event of any differences between the Accounting Principles, such
Example Calculations and the methodology used in the preparation of the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Statement, the
methodology used in the Accounting Principles will govern for purposes of this
Agreement. Crane shall provide the Sellers' Representatives and their
respective Representatives with access to







such work papers and other materials as the Sellers' Representatives or their
respective Representatives may reasonably request in connection with their
review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement. In the event
Crane fails to deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Sellers'
Representatives within the ninety (90) day period contemplated by this Section
2.5.2 the determination of Working Capital, Cash on Hand, Indebtedness and
Sellers' Transaction Expenses and Closing Indebtedness set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement shall, at the sole option of the Sellers'
Representatives, be final, conclusive and binding on the parties for purposes
of this Section 2.5.

2.5.3. Dispute Notice. The Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement
(and the proposed determinations of Working Capital, Cash on Hand, Closing
Indebtedness and Sellers' Transaction Expenses reflected on the Closing
Statement) will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties for purposes
of this Section 2.5, unless the Sellers' Representatives provides a written
notice (a "Dispute Notice") to Crane no later than forty-five (45) days after
delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement setting forth
in reasonable detail any item(s) or amount(s) on the Closing Balance Sheet
and/or the Closing Statement that are disputed by the Sellers' Representatives
(each, a "Disputed Item"). Any item or amount to which no dispute is raised in
the Dispute Notice will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties for
purposes of this Section 2.5.

2.5.4. Resolution of Disputes. Crane and the Sellers' Representatives will
attempt to resolve the Disputed Items in good faith during the twenty (20) day
period following delivery of the Dispute Notice. During such twenty (20) day
period, Crane shall provide, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to
provide, the Sellers' Representatives and their respective Representatives
with access to, and the opportunity to make copies of, the work papers and
other materials used or considered by Crane in the preparation of the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, and reasonable access to personnel
and Representatives of Crane and the Acquired Companies who assisted or were
consulted in the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement. Disputed Items resolved by the Sellers' Representatives and Crane
within such twenty (20) day period will be final, conclusive and binding on
the parties for purposes of this Section 2.5. If Crane and the Sellers'
Representatives are unable to resolve any Disputed Items in the Dispute Notice
within such twenty (20) day period, either Crane or the Sellers'
Representatives may provide written notice to the other(s) (the "Dispute
Submission Notice") that it is submitting the remaining Disputed Items for
resolution to KPMG or another nationally recognized independent accounting
firm chosen jointly by the Sellers' Representatives and the Buyers (the
"Independent Referee"). In the event that KPMG is unwilling or unable to act
as the Independent Referee and an alternative accounting firm is not selected
by mutual agreement of Crane and the Sellers' Representatives within ten (10)
days following the giving of the Dispute Submission Notice, each of Crane and
the Sellers' Representatives shall promptly select an accounting firm and
promptly cause such two accounting firms to mutually select a third
independent accounting firm to act as the Independent Referee. Crane and the
Sellers' Representatives will instruct the Independent Referee to render its
decision within thirty (30) days (and in any event as soon as practicable)
after the submission to







the Independent Referee of their respective final calculations of the Disputed
Items (which Crane and the Sellers' Representatives shall submit to the
Independent Referee not later than ten (10) days following the giving of the
Dispute Submission Notice or, if applicable, not later than ten (10) days
following the selection of an alternative independent accounting firm pursuant
to the preceding sentence). Each of Crane and the Sellers' Representatives
shall, and Crane shall cause the Acquired Companies to, use reasonable best
efforts to comply with all requests by the Independent Referee for access to
their respective work papers, information, books, records and similar items,
personnel and Representatives. Crane may require that the Independent Referee
enter into a customary form of confidentiality agreement with respect to the
work papers and other documents and information relating to the Acquired
Companies provided to the Independent Referee pursuant to this Section 2.5.
The Independent Referee's determination will be (a) in writing, (b) furnished
to each of Crane and the Sellers' Representatives within thirty (30) days, to
the extent practicable, and in any event as promptly as practicable, after the
Sellers' Representatives' and Crane's respective final calculations of the
Disputed Items have been submitted to the Independent Referee, (c) limited in
scope to whether such final calculations of the Disputed Items were done in
accordance with this Section 2.5, the Accounting Principles and the Example
Calculations and/or contained mathematical errors, (d) no more favorable to
the Buyers than is set forth in the Closing Statement and no more favorable to
the Sellers than is proposed in the Dispute Notice and (e) absent manifest
error, final, conclusive and binding on the parties for purposes of this
Section 2.5. Each party will bear its own costs and expenses in connection
with the resolution of such dispute by the Independent Referee. The costs and
expenses of the Independent Referee will be shared by the Buyers, on the hand,
and the Sellers, on the other hand, in inverse proportion to the relative
amounts of the disputed amount determined to be for the account of the Buyers
and the Sellers, respectively. Neither Crane nor the Sellers' Representatives
will disclose to the Independent Referee, and the Independent Referee must not
consider for any purpose, any settlement discussions or settlement offer made
by or on behalf of Crane or the Sellers' Representatives, unless otherwise
agreed by Crane and the Sellers' Representatives.

2.5.5. Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment. As promptly as possible, but in
any event no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the final
determination, in accordance with Section 2.5.3 and/or Section 2.5.4, of
Working Capital, Cash on Hand, Closing Indebtedness and Sellers' Transaction
Expenses (respectively, the "Final Working Capital Amount", "Final Cash on
Hand Amount", "Final Closing Indebtedness Amount" and "Final Transaction
Expenses"), a Purchase Price adjustment shall be made as follows:

(a) if the sum of the Final Working Capital Amount (whether positive or
negative) plus the Final Cash on Hand Amount less the Final Closing
Indebtedness Amount less the Final Transaction Expenses is less than the sum
of the Estimated Working Capital Amount (whether positive or negative) plus
the Estimated Cash on Hand Amount less the Estimated Closing Indebtedness
Amount less the Estimated Transaction Expenses, then the Japan Net Purchase
Price will be reduced







by an amount equal to such shortfall multiplied by the Japan Percentage and
the US Net Purchase Price will be reduced by an amount equal to such shortfall
multiplied by the US Percentage, which amount shall be paid to the Buyers as
directed by Crane from the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement by wire transfer of immediately available funds; and

(b) if the sum of the Final Working Capital Amount (whether positive or
negative) plus the Final Cash on Hand Amount less the Final Closing
Indebtedness Amount less the Final Transaction Expenses is greater than the
sum of the Estimated Working Capital Amount (whether positive or negative)
plus the Estimated Cash on Hand Amount less the Estimated Closing Indebtedness
Amount less the Estimated Transaction Expenses, then the Japan Net Purchase
Price will be increased by an amount equal to such excess multiplied by the
Japan Percentage and the US Net Purchase Price will be increased by an amount
equal to such excess multiplied by the US Percentage, which amount will be
paid as follows: (A) the product of such excess multiplied by the US
Stockholder Escrow Percentage will be paid by the Buyers to the Sellers'
Representatives by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to be further
distributed by the Sellers' Representatives to the Sellers in accordance with
their respective US Pro Rata Percentages, (B) the product of such excess
multiplied by the Japan Stockholder Escrow Percentage will be paid by the
Buyers to the Sellers' Representatives by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, to be further distributed by the Sellers' Representatives to
the Sellers in accordance with their respective Japan Pro Rata Percentages and
(C) the remainder of such excess will be paid to the Acquired Companies by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, to be further distributed by the
Acquired Companies net of any required withholding Taxes to the holders of US
Options entitled to receive payments under Section 2.4.1(d) in proportion to
the amounts so received in connection with the Closing.

(c) After resolution of the Final Working Capital Amount, Final Cash on Hand
Amount, Final Closing Indebtedness Amount and Final Transaction Expenses in
accordance with this Section 2.5, the Sellers' Representatives and Crane will
provide a joint written notice to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement notifying the Escrow Agent of the resolution thereof.

2.5.6. No Double Counting. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no item shall be counted more than once in the determination of the
Estimated Working Capital Amount, Final Working Capital Amount, Estimated Cash
on Hand Amount, Final Cash on Hand Amount, Estimated Closing Indebtedness
Amount, Final Closing Indebtedness Amount, Estimated Transaction Expenses or
Final Transaction Expenses.







2.6. Options.

2.6.1. US Options. Each option to purchase common stock of the US Holdco
(each, an "US Option") granted under the MEI Conlux Holdings (US), Inc. 2007
Executive Incentive Plan (the "US Option Plan") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing will be cancelled in exchange for a payment
to the holder of such US Option of an amount in cash equal to the excess (if
any) of the US Common Per Share Price over the per share exercise price of
such US Option, multiplied by the number of shares of US Common Stock for
which such US Option is then exercisable (the "US Option Consideration"). The
US Option Consideration shall be paid to the US Option holders subject to and
in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.4.1(d). Upon such payment, each
US Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Closing shall be
cancelled and terminated and no payment shall be made with respect thereto
(other than payment of the US Option Consideration pursuant to this
Agreement). All amounts owed to the holders of US Options under this Agreement
shall be reduced by all applicable withholding Taxes.

2.6.2. Exercise of Options Pre-Closing. In the event that any holder of US
Options or Japan Options exercises such options prior to the Closing, to the
extent the holder of such options is not already a party to this Agreement as
a Seller, the Sellers will seek to have such holder to execute a joinder
signature page to this Agreement, but if such holder does not so execute, then
the Sellers will cause such joinder to be executed in accordance with Section
4.2 of the Stockholders Agreement.

other applicable Legal Requirements. Each Acquired Company Plan that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service to
such effect and, to the Acquired Companies Knowledge, there are no facts or
circumstances that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Acquired Company Plan. Each Non-US Acquired
Company Plan that is intended to qualify for tax-preferential treatment under
applicable Legal Requirements so qualifies and has received, where required,
approval from the applicable Governmental Authority that it is so qualified
and, to the Acquired Companies Knowledge, no event has occurred or

Subsidiaries following the Closing.

that is a Welfare Plan provides benefits or coverage following retirement or
other termination of employment.

3.15.7. All outstanding US Options were granted under the US Option Plan.

3.15.8. Acceleration of Payments. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in conjunction with any other
event) will not cause accelerated vesting, payment or delivery of, or increase
the amount or value of any material payment or benefit under or in connection
with any Acquired Company Plan. No Acquired Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has made or has become obligated to make, and no Acquired Company or any of
its Subsidiaries will as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement become obligated to make, any payments that
would be nondeductible by reason of







Section 280G of the Code (without regard to subsection (b)(4) thereof), nor
will any Acquired Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to "gross up"
or otherwise compensate any individual because of the imposition of any excise
Tax under Sections 409A or 4999 of the Code on such a payment to the
individual.

conducted as of the date of this Agreement.

3.16.2. Schedule 3.16.2 sets forth an accurate and complete list of patents,

a Subsidiary of an Acquired Company owns the Acquired Companies Registered IP
free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens.

3.16.3. Except in the ordinary course of business and as would not cause a
Material Adverse Effect, with regard to Acquired Companies IP Rights that are
purported to be owned by an Acquired Company, no Acquired Company or any
Subsidiary of an Acquired Company has transferred ownership of, or granted an
exclusive license of or exclusive right to use any Acquired Companies IP
Rights to any other Person. Schedule 3.16.3 identifies all Contracts in effect

Subsidiary of an Acquired Company has, as of the date of this Agreement,
licensed or otherwise granted rights in any of the Acquired Companies IP
Rights to any Person, excluding commercial agreements entered into in the

party is in material default under, or in material breach or violation of, any
such Contract; and, to the Acquired Companies Knowledge and as of the date of
this Agreement, no event has occurred on or prior to the date hereof that







(with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute a material
default by an Acquired Company or any of its respective Subsidiaries under any
such Contract.

3.16.4. As of the date of this Agreement, no Acquired Company, or any
Subsidiary of any Acquired Company, is party to any Contract licensing or
sublicensing Intellectual Property Rights from a third party to an Acquired
Company or Subsidiary of an Acquired Company that are material to the business
of the Acquired Companies or involve annual payments by the Acquired Companies
in excess of $50,000 and exclusive of licenses for information technology
entered into in the ordinary course of business (the "Material Third Party
Intellectual Property Contracts").

3.16.5. All Acquired Companies Registered IP is valid and subsisting under
applicable Legal Requirement, except for those items of Acquired Companies
Registered IP that an Acquired Company has chosen to abandon in the ordinary
course of business.

3.16.6. Except as would not cause a Material Adverse Effect, the conduct of
the businesses of the Acquired Companies does not infringe or misappropriate
any other Person's Intellectual Property Rights or constitute unfair
competition or trade practices under any Legal Requirement. Except as set
forth in Schedule 3.16.6, since January 1, 2010 through the date of this
Agreement, no Acquired Company has received notice of any pending or
threatened Proceeding or any allegation or claim in which any Person alleges
that any Acquired Company, its business or the Acquired Companies IP Rights
has violated any Person's Intellectual Property Rights and there are no
pending disputes between any Acquired Company and, as of the date of this
Agreement, any other Person relating to the Acquired Companies IP Rights.

3.16.7. Each of the Acquired Companies have taken reasonable steps consistent
with the practices of their industry to protect and maintain confidential and
trade secret information. Such efforts have included the adoption of policies
calling for each employee and contractor who has received trade secret or
proprietary confidential information from an Acquired Company to enter into a
written agreement protecting such information or to be subject to a binding
policy preventing the unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.

3.16.8. The Acquired Company and each Subsidiary of an Acquired Company has
taken reasonable steps consistent with the practices of their industry to
assure that all software and data residing on its computer networks or
licensed or otherwise distributed to customers is free of viruses and other
disruptive technological means. To the Acquired Companies' Knowledge, none of
the computer software developed by an Acquired Company contains any computer
code or other mechanism of any kind designed to improperly and illegally
disrupt, disable or harm in any manner the operation of any software or
hardware or other business processes or to misuse, gain unauthorized access to
or misappropriate any business or personal information, including worms,
bombs, backdoors, clocks, timers, or other disabling device code, or designs
or routines that cause software or information to be erased, inoperable, or







otherwise incapable of being used, either automatically or with passage of
time or upon command.

in any event within thirty (30) days after the Closing) remove, erase, delete
or otherwise destroy all such documents and information to the extent they
concern the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the
Acquired Companies).

8.3.2. From and after the Closing, each Seller shall, and shall cause its, his
or her respective Affiliates and its, his or her respective Representatives
to, keep confidential and not use or disclose documents and information
concerning (i) the Buyers furnished to the Sellers or their respective
Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions or (ii) the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries
of the Acquired Companies; provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing set forth in this Agreement shall restrict any







Seller or its Affiliates in its ordinary course fund reporting or marketing to
Persons that are subject to confidentiality obligations.

8.3.3. Announcements. Any public announcements, reports, statements or press
releases by any party hereto or any of its Affiliates regarding the
Contemplated Transactions must be approved in advance (as to form, content,
timing and manner of distribution) by each of Crane and the Sellers'
Representatives, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that any party hereto may issue a
press release or make a public announcement to the extent necessary for such
party to comply with applicable securities laws or any listing agreement with
an exchange upon which such party's securities are listed, and, to the extent
practicable, shall provide a copy to the Sellers' Representatives (if such
party is a Buyer or an Acquired Company) or Crane (if such party is a Seller
or an Acquired Company) in advance of its release; provided further, that no
approval shall be required with respect to any announcement, report, statement
or press release relating solely to information discussed in a previous
announcement, report, statement or press release.

8.3.4. Permitted Disclosures. No provision of this Section 8.3 will be
construed to prohibit (a) confidential disclosures to legal counsel,
accounting advisors and financial advisors, (b) disclosures pursuant to the
requirements of a Governmental Order, (c) disclosures required in connection
with legal proceedings between the parties, including to the extent reasonably
necessary to enforce the parties' respective rights hereunder, (d) disclosures
of information that is publicly available other than as a result of
disclosures made in breach hereof or (e) disclosures required under any
applicable Legal Requirement.

8.4. Preparation for Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each
of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary or desirable under applicable Legal Requirements to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions as promptly as practicable, including preparing and
filing as promptly as practicable with the applicable Governmental Authorities
all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents necessary to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. In
furtherance (and not in limitation) of the foregoing:

8.4.1. Antitrust Matters. Each of the Acquired Companies and the Buyers agrees
to file all appropriate notifications and filings pursuant to the HSR Act or
any applicable foreign antitrust and competition laws with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions in the most expeditious manner practicable, but in
any event within 30 Business Days after the date hereof (it being agreed that
the appropriate notification within such timeframe for EU filing purposes is
Form RS), and to supply promptly any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested of such party by the relevant Governmental
Authorities in connection with the HSR Act or any applicable foreign antitrust
and competition laws. The Buyers agree to use reasonable best efforts to take,
and to cause their respective Affiliates to use reasonable best efforts to
take, any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate as soon as reasonably







practicable each and every impediment under the HSR Act or any applicable
foreign antitrust and competition laws that may be asserted by any United
States or foreign governmental antitrust authority so as to enable the parties
to expeditiously consummate the Contemplated Transactions (including
committing to and/or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale or disposition of such assets, securities, facilities or
other properties as are required to be divested in order to facilitate the
expiration or termination of the HSR Act waiting period or agreeing to any
other conditions imposed by any United States or foreign governmental
antitrust authority) and otherwise use reasonable best efforts to obtain all
applicable merger control clearances under the HSR Act or any applicable
foreign antitrust and competition laws; provided that the parties hereto agree
that it is reasonable for the Buyers to agree, and the Buyers shall be
obligated hereunder to agree to, conditions that, individually or
cumulatively, involve structural or other changes to the conduct of the
Business or the Buyers' business, or both, which, if taken, would have reduced
2011 gross sales, for the Acquired Companies, the Buyers and the Buyers'
Affiliates, either individually or in the aggregate, by less than $15 million;
provided, further, that the parties hereto agree that nothing herein shall
obligate the Buyers to agree to conditions that, individually or or in the
aggregate, involve structural or other changes to the conduct of the Business
or the Buyers' business, or both, which, if taken, would have reduced 2011
gross sales, for the Acquired Companies, the Buyers and the Buyers'
Affiliates, either individually or in the aggregate, by $15 million or more.
The Buyers, on the one hand, and the Acquired Companies, on the other, shall
jointly pay in equal amounts the filing fees associated with the HSR filings
and any applicable foreign antitrust and competition laws. Each of the
Acquired Companies and the Buyers agrees not to participate in any substantive
meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any United
States or foreign governmental antitrust authority in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance,
if at all possible, and, to the extent not prohibited by such governmental
antitrust authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate. The Acquired Companies and the Buyers will supply each other with
copies of all correspondence, filings or communications with governmental
antitrust authorities with respect to the Contemplated Transactions; provided,
however, that to extent any of the documents or information are commercially
or competitively sensitive, the Acquired Companies or the Buyers, as the case
may be, may satisfy its obligations by providing such documents or information
to the other party's outside antitrust counsel, with the understanding that
such counsel shall not share such documents and information with its client.

8.4.2. Certain Filings, Etc. Each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with
one another (a) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from third parties to any
Material Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions and (b) in taking such actions or making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking timely to
obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers; provided, that
nothing in this Agreement shall obligate or be construed to obligate any
Seller or any Acquired Company to make or cause to be made any payment or
concession to any third







party in order to obtain any such action, consent, approval or waiver under
any Material Contract.

8.5. Business Records. The Buyers each acknowledge that the Sellers'
Representatives may from time to time from and after the Closing require
access to the books and records of the Acquired Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries to enable them to prepare financial statements, and agrees that
upon reasonable prior notice, it will, and will ensure that the Acquired
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries will, during normal business
hours, provide the Sellers' Representatives and their respective
Representatives with either access to or copies of such books and records for
the purpose of enabling the Sellers to prepare financial statements. After the
Closing, the Buyers will retain for a period consistent with the Buyer's
record retention policies and practices the records of the Acquired Companies
and their Subsidiaries.

8.6. Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations. During
the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing
Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, each
Buyer hereby agrees that it is not authorized to and shall not (and shall not
permit any of its respective Representatives or Affiliates to) contact any
employee (excluding executive officers), customer, supplier, distributor or
other material business relation of any Acquired Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries regarding the Acquired Companies or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, their respective businesses or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent of the Sellers'
Representatives, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

8.7. Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance.

8.7.1. Each Buyer and each Acquired Company agree that, to the maximum extent
permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware, all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation from liability for acts or omissions
occurring in connection with or prior to the Closing now existing in favor of
the current or former directors or officers of any Acquired Company or any of
its respective Subsidiaries ("DandO Indemnified Persons"), including as provided
in the Organizational Documents of such Acquired Company and its respective
Subsidiaries, will survive the Closing and will continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their respective terms. In furtherance (and not in
limitation of) the foregoing, for the six (6) year period following the
Closing Date, the Buyers shall cause the Organizational Documents of the
Acquired Companies and their respective Subsidiaries to contain provisions
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liability that are at least as favorable to the DandO Indemnified Persons as
those contained in the Acquired Companies' and their respective Subsidiaries'
Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions
will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Person.

8.7.2. At or before the Closing, the Buyers shall obtain and pay for, and for
a six (6) year period thereafter the Buyers will cause each Acquired Company
to







maintain in effect, a so-called "tail" policy for such six (6) year period
covering acts or omissions occurring on or before the Closing Date with
respect to those Persons who are currently covered by either an Acquired
Company's or its respective Subsidiaries' directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy or employment practices liability insurance policy on terms
with respect to such coverage and amounts at least as favorable to such
Persons as those of such policies in effect on the date hereof.

8.7.3. If any Acquired Company or any of its respective Subsidiaries (or any
of its respective successors or assigns) transfers all or substantially all of
their respective properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, the Buyers will cause proper provision to be made so that such
successors and assigns assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.7.

8.7.4. This Section 8.7 shall be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, the DandO Indemnified Persons, and their respective heirs and estates, and
such persons shall be third party beneficiaries of this Agreement for such
purposes.

8.8. Attorney-Client Privilege. Following the Closing, the Buyers and each
Acquired Company agrees that it shall take all reasonable steps necessary to
ensure that any privilege attaching as a result of Ropes and Gray LLP, Pepper
Hamilton, Nagashima Ohno and Tsunematsu or other counsel from time to time
retained by an Acquired Company or any of its respective Subsidiaries prior to
the Closing (collectively, "Prior Acquired Companies Counsel") providing
advice in connection with the negotiation, execution and consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions, shall survive the Closing and shall remain in
effect, provided that from and after the Closing such privilege shall be
controlled by the Sellers' Representatives and not such Acquired Company or
its Subsidiaries. In addition, each of the Buyers and each Acquired Company
(on behalf of itself and its respective Subsidiaries) waives any conflicts
that may arise in connection with (a) Prior Acquired Companies Counsel
representing any Seller after the Closing in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions or any dispute arising in connection therewith and (b) the
communication by Prior Acquired Companies Counsel to any Seller, in any such
representation, of any fact known to Prior Acquired Companies Counsel,
including without limitation in connection with any negotiation, arbitration,
mediation, litigation or other proceeding in any way related to a dispute with
any Buyer or any Acquired Company following the Closing, and the disclosure of
any such fact in connection with any process undertaken for the resolution of
such dispute. Each of the Buyers and each Acquired Company acknowledges that
it has had the opportunity to discuss and obtain adequate information
concerning the significance and material risks of, and reasonable available
alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and other provisions of this Section
8.8, including without limitation the opportunity to consult with counsel
other than Prior Acquired Companies Counsel. This Section 8.8 is for the
benefit of the Sellers and each Prior Acquired Companies Counsel, and Sellers
and each Prior Acquired Companies Counsel are intended third party
beneficiaries of this Section 8.8. This Section 8.8 shall be irrevocable, and
no term of this Section 8.8 may be amended, waived or modified, without the
prior written consent of the Sellers' Representatives and the Prior Acquired
Companies Counsel affected thereby.







8.9. Tax Matters.

8.9.1. Covered Tax Returns.

(a) The Buyers shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries for all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods which were not filed on or prior to the Closing Date,
and for all Straddle Periods (such Tax Returns, collectively, "Covered Tax
Returns"). All Covered Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with the
principles set forth below in Section 8.9.1(b) and otherwise in accordance
with the past practices of the applicable Acquired Company or Subsidiary,
except as required by changes in applicable Tax laws or changes in fact. Crane
shall provide a copy of any Covered Tax Returns prepared pursuant to this
Section 8.9.1(a)) and copies of any other relevant supporting schedules and
other documentation that are reasonably requested by the Sellers'
Representatives, to the Sellers' Representatives for their review and comment
as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event no later than (i) forty
(40) days prior to the due date (including valid extensions) for filing such
Tax Returns in the case of any income or similar type Tax Return, and (ii)
twenty five (25) days prior to the due date (including valid extensions) for
filing such Tax Returns in the case of any other types of Tax Return. Crane
shall, upon reasonable request by the Sellers' Representatives, provide copies
of relevant supporting schedules and work papers related to Covered Tax
Returns pursuant to this Section 8.9.1(a). Crane, on the one hand, and the
Sellers' Representatives, on the other hand, agree to consult and resolve in
good faith any dispute with respect to any Covered Tax Returns prior to the
due date for the filing of such Tax Return.

(b) Crane (i) shall file a federal income Tax Return of US Holdco for the
taxable year ending on the Closing Date pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-76(c) (and not pursuant to the "next day" rule under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or pursuant to the ratable
allocation method under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or
1.1502-76(b)(2)(iii)), (ii) shall allocate all items accruing on the Closing
Date to US Holdco taxable period ending on the Closing Date pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1) to the extent
applicable, (iii) shall not elect to waive any carryback of net operating
losses under Section 172(b)(3) of the Code on any Tax Return of US Holdco
filed in respect of a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, and
(iv) to the extent possible shall apply the provisions of clauses (i) through
(iii) above for all applicable state and local income Tax purposes under the
applicable Tax rules.

(c) In the case of any taxable period of an Acquired Company that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle







Period"), (i) the amount of any Taxes (or any refund or credit of Taxes) based
on or measured by income, receipts, payroll or sales for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the
close of business on the Closing Date provided, that, in determining such
amount, exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on a periodic
basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be taken into account on
a pro-rated basis in the manner described in clause (ii) below, and (ii) the
amount of other Taxes (or any refund or credit of such other Taxes) for the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

8.9.2. Closing of Taxable Period; Consolidated Return. The Buyers and their
respective Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies)
shall take all actions necessary to close the Tax year of US Holdco and its
Subsidiaries as of the end of the Closing Date for U.S. federal income tax
purposes and all applicable state, local and foreign income Tax purposes.

8.9.3. Amendments or Modifications of Tax Returns. After the Closing Date, the
Buyers shall not, and shall not allow any of the Acquired Companies or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or otherwise
change any Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or for any Straddle Period without the prior written consent of the
Sellers' Representatives, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed (it being understood that it would not be unreasonable
to withhold any such consent if such amendment, modification or change could
result in adverse monetary consequences to any of the Sellers).

8.9.4. Tax Refunds. The Sellers shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes
relating to the Acquired Companies or any of their Subsidiaries resulting from
a claim for refund, the filing of a Tax Return or otherwise that is
attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or to any portion of a Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date ("Tax Refunds"). Subject to the escrow
requirements below, the applicable Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, any
Tax Refunds and the interest actually received thereon to the Sellers'
Representative within ten (10) days from the receipt thereof for further
distribution to the Sellers and holders of the US Options in proportion to the
amounts they were paid at Closing pursuant to Section 2.4 in respect of their
interests in the Acquired Companies. Tax Refunds attributable to Straddle
Periods shall be calculated in a manner consistent with the provisions of
Section 8.9.1(c). Upon the Sellers' Representatives' reasonable determination
of the availability of a Tax Refund, the Sellers' Representatives may request
that the Buyers, any of the Acquired Companies, their Subsidiaries or any
Affiliate thereof shall file a claim for a Tax Refund or file an amended Tax
Return claiming a Tax Refund (with the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of such filing being at the expense of the Sellers) and use
commercially







reasonable efforts to conduct, at the Sellers\' expense, the prosecution of
any such claim for a Tax Refund. The Buyers shall as soon as reasonably
practicable comply, or shall cause any applicable Acquired Company or
Affiliate thereof to promptly comply with a request from the Sellers'
Representatives in accordance with the foregoing. Any Tax Refunds received
prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date will be placed in the
Escrow Account and treated as additional Escrow Funds, to be dealt with in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, and 50% of any Tax Refund received on or
after the third anniversary of the Closing Date, but prior to the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date, will be placed into the Escrow Account and
treated as additional Escrow Funds, to be be dealt with in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a portion of
any Tax Refund relates solely to tax deductions incurred in 2013 (but prior to
the Closing) with respect to professional fees paid by the Acquired Companies
to their financial advisors and accounting and Tax advisors (as determined on
a with and without basis, by calculating the amount of Tax Refund that would
have been received but for the Tax deductions attributable solely to such
professional fees) (the "Buyer Refund"), the Buyers shall be entitled to the
benefit of such Buyer Refund net of the relative portion of any expenses
incurred (or payable) by the Sellers with respect to obtaining such Tax Refund
(the "Net Buyer Refund"). Within five (5) days from the receipt of any Tax
Refund which the Buyers reasonably determine includes a Buyer Refund, the
Buyers shall provide the Sellers' Representatives with a detailed schedule
setting forth the calculation of the Net Buyer Refund and the parties shall
consult and resolve in good faith any dispute with respect to such amount. For
the avoidance of doubt, the applicable Buyer may not delay the payment in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.9.4 of any other Tax Refunds
or any portion thereof that is not a Buyer Refund pending the resolution of
any dispute regarding the amount of the Net Buyer Refund.

8.9.15. [Reserved]

8.9.6. Transfer Taxes. The Buyers, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the
other hand, shall jointly pay, in equal amounts, all Transfer Taxes, if any,
relating to the Contemplated Transactions (for the avoidance of doubt, not
including any financing contemplated by the Buyers in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions), except that the Buyers shall not be responsible
for Transfer Taxes, if any, arising solely as a result of the repayment of the
Intercompany Loans and/or the payment of the Preferred Stock Consideration.
Each party hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avail itself
and make available to the other parties any available exemptions from any such
Transfer Taxes, and to cooperate with the other parties in providing any
information and documentation that may be necessary to obtain such exemptions.
The Buyers shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all such Tax
Returns relating to Transfer Taxes that are required to be filed by the
Acquired Companies after the Closing Date (the "Transfer Tax Returns"). To the
extent required by applicable Legal Requirements, the Sellers' Representative
(on behalf of the Sellers) shall cooperate with the Buyers in the preparation
and filing of such Transfer Tax Returns. Buyers shall deliver to the Sellers'
Representatives any such Transfer Tax Returns for review and comment as soon
as reasonably practicable and in any event no later than







twenty-five (25) days prior to the due date (including valid extensions) for
filing such Transfer Tax Returns. The Buyers shall, upon reasonable request by
the Sellers' Representatives, provide copies of relevant supporting schedules
and other reasonably requested information related to such Transfer Tax
Returns. Crane, on the one hand, and the Sellers' Representatives, on the
other hand, agree to consult and resolve in good faith any dispute with
respect to any Transfer Tax Returns prior to the due date for the filing of
such Transfer Tax Return.

8.9.7. FIRPTA Certificate. Prior to the Closing, the US Holdco shall deliver
to Crane a certificate in compliance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-2(c)(3), certifying that the US Holdco is not and has not been a "U.S.
real property holding corporation" (as defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the
Code) during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c) of the Code
(the "FIRPTA Certificate").

8.9.8. Allocation of Purchase Price. For federal and all other applicable
state, local and foreign income Tax purposes, the parties hereto agree that
the purchase price and other consideration received by or treated for
applicable Tax purposes as received by the Sellers in consideration for the
Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall be allocated between the Acquired
Companies as set forth in Article 2 hereto. No party hereto shall take any
position that is inconsistent with such allocation on its Tax Returns except
as required by a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or
by an applicable Taxing Authority.

8.9.9. Cooperation and Tax Record Retention. The Buyers and their Affiliates
(including after the Closing, the Acquired Companies) shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Sellers in connection with reasonable
requests by the Sellers relating to Tax matters that relate to the Acquired
Companies, including in connection with (i) the preparation and timely filing
of any Tax Return of the Acquired Companies or any Tax Return relating to
Transfer Taxes, (ii) Tax Proceedings, (iii) any claim or calculation relating
to Tax Refunds, and (iv) the provision of information, records, or other
documents relating to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies. Without
limiting the foregoing, from and after the Closing, the Buyers, the Acquired
Companies and their respective Affiliates shall provide the Sellers'
Representatives reasonable access to their relevant books and records and
other documents reasonably requested by the Sellers' Representatives, and
shall, upon reasonable request, make available (and take reasonable actions
necessary to make available) to the Sellers' Representatives the relevant
persons (including, for the avoidance of doubt, relevant employees and/or Tax
and accounting professionals) advising them to the extent necessary in order
to provide additional information and explanation with respect to such
relevant information and/or other items reasonably requested by the Sellers'
Representatives in connection with Tax matters that relate to the Acquired
Companies. The Buyers shall retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Acquired Companies relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (taking into account any extensions thereof) applicable to such
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any Taxing Authority.







8.9.10. Tax Proceedings.

(a) Crane shall promptly notify the Sellers' Representatives in writing of the
commencement or any notice of Tax deficiency, proposed Tax adjustment, Tax
assessment, Tax audit, Tax examination or other administrative or court
proceeding, suit, dispute or other official claim with respect to Taxes
relating to the Acquired Companies and their Affiliates that, if determined
adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time could be grounds for a
claim for indemnity pursuant to Section 9.2.1(iii) (a "Tax Proceeding"). The
Buyers shall promptly deliver to the Sellers' Representatives copies of
relevant portion of notices and other documents received in connection with
such Tax Proceedings.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to any Tax Proceedings relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Sellers'
Representatives shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof (at
the Sellers' expense) and, if the Sellers' Representatives so choose, to
assume the defense thereof (at the Sellers' expense) with counsel selected by
the Sellers' Representatives by providing written notice to Crane within
thirty (30) days after Crane provides written notice of such Tax Proceeding to
the Sellers' Representatives. If the Sellers' Representatives assume defense
and control of any Tax Proceedings, the Sellers' Representatives shall keep
Crane reasonably informed of the status of such Tax Proceedings and shall not
settle such Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of Crane, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the
Sellers' Representatives choose not to control a Tax Proceeding, then Crane,
shall control and conduct such Tax Proceeding diligently and shall keep the
Sellers' Representatives reasonably informed of the status of such Tax
Proceedings. Crane shall not settle such Tax Proceeding without the prior
written consent of the applicable Sellers' Representatives, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to any Tax Proceedings relating to a Straddle Period, the Sellers'
Representatives shall have the right to jointly control and manage any such
Tax Proceedings with counsel selected by the Sellers' Representatives together
with Crane by providing written notice to Crane within thirty (30) days after
Crane provides written notice of such Tax Proceeding to the Sellers'
Representatives. In any event, each party shall keep the other party
reasonably informed of the status of such Tax Proceedings and no party shall
in any event settle such Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of
the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.









8.9.11. Tax-Sharing Agreements. All Tax allocation, Tax sharing or similar
agreements to which any Acquired Company or Subsidiary is a party, on the one
hand, and the Sellers or any of their Affiliates (other than, for purposes of
this Section 8.9.11, the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries) is a
party, on the other hand, will be terminated as of the Closing Date, and after
the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries will not be
bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

8.9.12. Tax Indemnity. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, no Seller shall be responsible for, and the Buyer Indemnities shall
not be entitled to indemnification for any Loss with respect to: (A) any Taxes
payable by the Buyers pursuant to Section 8.9.6; (B) Taxes of or allocable to
any Tax period commencing on or after the Closing Date and the portion of any
Straddle Period commencing after the Closing Date; (C) Taxes taken into
account in determining or adjusting the US Net Purchase Price, the Japan Net
Purchase Price or otherwise the consideration payable under this Agreement,
(D) Taxes resulting from or attributable to a breach by a Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Acquired Companies and their
Subsidiaries) of any of their obligations under this Agreement and (E) Taxes
attributable to actions taken by the Buyers or any of their respective
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Acquired Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries) on the Closing Date but after the Closing (except to
the extent such actions are expressly provided for in connection with the
Closing).

8.10. Nonsolicitation of Employees. During the period commencing on the
Closing Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, each
Seller will not directly or indirectly, for itself or on behalf of or in
conjunction with any other Person, call upon any employee who is, at the time
the individual is called upon, an employee of any Buyer, any Acquired Company
or any Subsidiary of any Acquired Company for the purpose or with the intent
of soliciting such employee away from or out of the employ of any Buyer, any
Acquired Company or any Subsidiary of any Acquired Company, or employ or offer
employment to any individual who was or is employed by any Buyer, any Acquired
Company or any Subsidiary of any Acquired Company unless such individual will
have ceased to be employed by the Buyers, the Acquired Companies or their
respective Subsidiaries for a period of at least six months prior thereto;
provided, however, that this Section 8.10 will not (i) be deemed to prohibit
any Seller from engaging in general media advertising or solicitation that may
be targeted to a particular geographic or technical area but that is not
targeted towards employees of any Buyer, any Acquired Company or any
Subsidiary of any Acquired Company and (ii) apply in connection with the
actions of any portfolio company affiliated with any Seller to the extent that
employees or agents of such Seller or its direct or indirect owners did not
cause such action. Each Seller recognizes and agrees that a breach by it of
the covenants set forth in this Section 8.10 could cause irreparable harm to
the Buyers, Acquired Companies or their Subsidiaries, that the Buyers'
remedies at law in the event of such breach would be inadequate, and that,
accordingly, in the event of such breach, a restraining order or injunction or
both may be issued against such Seller, or any other offending party, without
the posting of the bond, in addition to any other rights and remedies that are
available to the harmed party. If this Section 8.10 is more restrictive than
permitted by the laws of any jurisdiction in which a Buyer seeks enforcement
hereof, this Section 8.10 will be limited to the extent required to permit
enforcement under such laws.







8.11. Notification. Until the Closing, the Acquired Companies, the Sellers'
Representatives and the Buyer will give prompt notice to the Buyers (with
respect to the Sellers or the Acquired Companies) or the Sellers'
Representatives (with respect to the Buyers) of (a) the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of any event which would reasonably be expected to cause the
failure of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 7.1 (as
applicable), (b) any failure to comply with or satisfy any covenant or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by the Acquired Companies, the
Sellers or the Buyers (as applicable) under this Agreement and (c) the failure
of any condition precedent to the Buyers' or Sellers' (as applicable)
obligations under this Agreement.

8.12. No Negotiation. Until the Closing, the Acquired Companies and each
Seller will not, and will cause their respective Affiliates and
Representatives not to, take any action to solicit, initiate, seek, encourage
or support any inquiry, proposal or offer from, furnish any information to,
participate in any negotiations with, or discuss with any Person (other than
with the Buyers and their respective Affiliates and Representatives) regarding
any business combination transaction involving any Acquired Company or any
Subsidiary of any Acquired Company or any other transaction to acquire all or
any material part of the business, properties or assets of any Acquired
Company or any Subsidiary of any Acquired Company or any amount of the capital
stock of any Acquired Company or any Subsidiary of any Acquired Company

of stock, tender offer, lease, license or otherwise. The Acquired Companies
and each Seller agrees that any such negotiations in progress as of the date
of this Agreement will be terminated or suspended during such period.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing set forth in this
Section 8.12 shall limit the Sellers' or the Acquired Companies' ability to
pursue the transactions described on Schedule 8.2.

8.13. Financial Statements. Until the Closing, on or before the 21st day of

8.14. Further Assurances. Each of the Sellers and each of the Buyers, upon the
request of the other from time to time after the Closing, and at the expense
of the requesting party but without further consideration, shall sign such
documents and take such actions as may be necessary or otherwise reasonably
requested to make more fully effective the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions.







8.15. Matters Relating to Warrants, Preferred Stock, Etc. At or prior to the
Closing, each Seller that holds warrants to purchase Shares will exercise such
warrants in the manner contemplated on Schedule 3.3. At or prior to the
Closing, the Acquired Companies will take all actions to ensure that, upon
payment of the Preferred Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(f), the
Preferred Stock ceases to be outstanding. At or prior to the Closing, each
Seller will take all actions to ensure that any obligations relating to the
Intercompany Loans owed by or owing to US Holdco and its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and Japan Holdco and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, cease to
be outstanding.

8.16. Compliance Steps.

8.16.1. From the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, the Acquired
Companies will use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct an investigation
into their compliance with the Legal Requirements described on Schedule
8.16.1. To the extent that the Acquired Companies determine that they are not
in compliance with any of the Legal Requirements described on Schedule 8.16.1,
the Acquired Companies will (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to comply
with such Legal Requirements and (ii) use commercially reasonably efforts to
resolve any prior non-compliance with such Legal Requirements (in the case of
this clause (ii) only) that could reasonably be expected to have a material
and adverse effect on the Business.

8.16.2. To the extent that the Acquired Companies determine that they are not
in compliance with any of the Legal Requirements described on Schedule 8.16.2,
the Acquired Companies will use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with
such Legal Requirements.

specified on Schedule 8.16.4 with respect to the Legal Requirements described

8.17. Financing.

8.17.1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Buyers
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) described in the Financing Letter
and shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any provision under the Financing Letter, if such amendment,
modification or waiver (A) with respect to the Financing Letter, reduces (or
could have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing
(including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount) or (B) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands,
amends or modifies any of the conditions to the Financing, or otherwise
expands, amends or modifies any other provision of the Financing Letter, in a
manner









that would reasonably be expected to (x) delay or prevent or make less likely
the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the
Financing) on the Closing Date or (y) adversely impact the ability of the
Buyers to enforce their rights against other party to the Financing Letter.
The Buyers shall promptly deliver to the Acquired Companies copies of any such
amendment, modification or replacement. For purposes of this Section 8.17,
references to "Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the
Financing Letters as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this
Section 8.17.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyers may amend,
supplement, modify or replace the Financing Letter as in effect at the date
hereof solely to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Financing
Letter as of the date of this Agreement.

8.17.2. Each of the Buyers shall use its reasonable best efforts (A) to
maintain in effect the Financing Letter, (B) to negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Financing Letter on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) contained in the Financing Letter
(or on terms not materially less favorable to the Buyers than the terms and
conditions (including flex provisions) in the Financing Letter), (C) to
satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain the waiver of) all conditions to funding
in the Financing Letter and such definitive agreements thereto that are within
its control and consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, (D) to
enforce its rights under the Financing Letter and (E) to comply in all
material respects with its obligations under the Financing Letter. The Buyers
shall keep the Acquired Companies informed on a current basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Buyers shall give the
Acquired Companies prompt notice (x) of any material breach or default (or any
event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any default or breach) by any party to the Financing
Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing of which any Buyer
becomes aware, (y) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from a Financing Source with respect to any (1) actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the
Financing Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing of any
provisions of the Financing Letter or definitive agreements related to the
Financing or (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties
to the Financing Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing, and
(z) if at any time for any reason the Buyers believe in good faith that they
will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms
and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the
Financing Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing. As soon
as reasonably practicable, but in any event within three Business Days of the
date the Acquired Companies deliver to the Acquired Companies a written
request, the Buyers shall provide any information reasonably requested by the
Acquired Companies relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (x), (y)
or (z) of the immediately preceding sentence. Upon the occurrence of any
circumstance referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the second preceding
sentence or if any portion of the Financing otherwise becomes unavailable or
the Buyers become aware of any event or circumstance that would reasonably be
expected to make any portion of the Financing becoming unavailable, the Buyers
shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and







obtain in replacement thereof alternative financing from alternative sources
in an amount sufficient to consummate the Contemplated Transactions with terms
and conditions not materially less favorable to the Buyers (or their
Affiliates) than the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Letter,
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event.
The Buyer shall deliver to the Acquired Companies true and complete copies of
all Contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which any such alternative
source shall have committed to provide any portion of the Financing. The
Buyers acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Financing, or any
alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing.

8.17.3. The Acquired Companies shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective Representatives to provide, on a timely basis, all reasonable
cooperation requested by the Buyers in connection with the arrangement of
Financing, including, (i) promptly providing the lenders and their respective
agents with all financial information regarding the Acquired Companies and
their Subsidiaries required to prepare customary bank information memoranda
and lender presentations in connection with such Financing; (ii) participating
(including by making members of senior management with appropriate seniority
and expertise available to participate) in a reasonable number of meetings,
due diligence sessions, presentations, drafting sessions and sessions with the
rating agencies in connection with the Financing; (iii) reasonably cooperating
with the lenders and their respective agents' due diligence, to the extent not
unreasonably interfering with the business of the Acquired Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries, including access to documentation reasonably
requested by persons in connection with bank financings; (iv) reasonably
cooperating with the marketing efforts for any portion of the Financing,
including using its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any
syndication effort benefits from any existing banking relationship; and (v)
reasonably cooperating with the preparation of bank information memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents, rating agency presentations, road show
presentations and written offering materials used to complete the Financing,
to the extent information contained therein relates to the business of the
Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries; provided, however, that neither the
Acquired Companies nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be responsible for any
cost, commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in
connection with the Financing prior to the Closing.

8.17.4. The Buyers shall promptly, upon request by an Acquired Company,
reimburse the Acquired Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Acquired
Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the
cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by Section 8.17.3
and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Acquired Companies, their respective
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them
in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information used
in connection therewith, except with respect to any information provided by
the Acquired Companies or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives expressly
for use in connection with the Financing and other than any such losses,
damages, claims, costs or expenses arising as a result of any Fraud by an
Acquired Company or its Subsidiaries or Representatives.







8.18. Release.

8.18.1. Each Seller, on such Seller's own behalf and on behalf of each of such
Seller's Affiliates (collectively with such Seller, the "Releasors"), hereby
releases and forever discharges, as of the Closing, each Acquired Company and
each of such Acquired Company's respective Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and employees (collectively with the Acquired Companies, the "Releasees") from
any and all claims, suits, charges, demands, complaints, causes of action,
debts, damages, obligations, promises, judgments, agreements and liabilities
of any kind or nature whatsoever (including claims for damages, costs,
expenses, and attorneys', brokers' and accountants' fees and expenses)
("Claims"), whether known or unknown and whether at law or in equity, arising
from or related to events, facts, conditions or circumstances existing or
arising on or prior to the Closing Date, including, without limitation, any
Claims that the undersigned has or may in the future have against the
Releasees, and hereby irrevocably agrees to refrain from directly or
indirectly asserting any claim or demand or commencing (or causing to be
commenced or assisting with) any suit, action or proceeding of any kind, in
any court or before any tribunal, against the Releasees based upon any Claim.
The release contained in this Section 8.18.1 is effective without regard to
the legal nature of the claims raised and without regard to whether any such
claims are based upon tort, equity, implied or express contract or otherwise.
Each Seller understands that this Section 8.18.1 (subject to the proviso
below) includes a full and final release covering all known and unknown,
suspected or unsuspected injuries, debts, claims or damages which have arisen
or may have arisen from any matters, acts, omissions or dealings actually
released in this Section 8.18.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if a
Seller is an employee of a Releasee, the foregoing release shall not apply to
any Claims that such Seller has or may have arising under or in connection
with any employment relationship between such Seller and any Releasee, any
termination of any such employment relationship by any Releasee, or any
salary, bonuses, severance or "change of control" payments, vacation pay,
benefits or expense reimbursement and (ii) nothing set forth in the release
set forth this Section 8.18.1 shall restrict or in any way affect any Claims
of a Releasor under this Agreement and any document or agreement delivered in
connection therewith.

8.18.2. For the purpose of implementing a full and complete release and
discharge of the released Claims set forth in Section 8.18.11 (but subject to
the last sentence in Section 8.18.1), each Seller acknowledges that the
release set forth in Section 8.18.1 is intended to include in its effect
claims that the Releasors do not know or suspect to exist in their favor at
the time of execution of this Release, and the release set forth in Section
8.18.1 contemplates the extinguishment of all such claims.

8.19. Amendment to Schedule 3.3. At any time after the date hereof and prior
to the Closing, the Sellers' Representative may update Schedule 3.3 to reflect
events, matters, items, or facts first occurring or first existing after the
date of this Agreement to the extent that, but for such update being made, the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.3 would be inaccurate or
incorrect as of the Closing as a result of any action taken in compliance with
Section 8.2 or Section 11.7.

arising from or attributable to the repayment of the Intercompany Loans and
the payment of the Preferred Stock Consideration), (2) Taxes imposed on the
Sellers with respect to their ownership of the Shares, including any liability

upon the sale of the Shares or the Japan Options, (3) Taxes of any member of

imposed on the Acquired Companies or their Subsidiaries by reason of filing

payable by the Sellers pursuant to Section 8.9.6, and (vi) the matter

9.2.2. Notwithstanding Section 9.2.1, each Seller shall be responsible for
100% of any Loss suffered or incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee directly or
indirectly arising out of, relating to or resulting from (i) a breach of any
Fundamental Representation made by such Seller in Article 4 or (ii) any breach
of any covenant or agreement of such Seller contained in Sections 8.3.2, 8.10
or 8.14.

even if a Buyer Indemnitee would otherwise be entitled to recover a Loss
pursuant to this Agreement, other than with respect to (a) claims in respect
of a breach of any Fundamental Representation, (b) claims made pursuant to

of covenants of a Seller contained in Sections 8.3.2, 8.10 or 8.14, (d) claims
first asserted under any provision of this Article 9 on or after April 1, 2014
and (e) claims made pursuant to Section 9.2.1(v), (i) no Buyer Indemnitee will

of all Losses relating to a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement of the Company or any Seller contained in this Agreement would
exceed $3,500,000 (the "Deductible"), and then only to the extent such Losses
exceed the Deductible and (ii) the Sellers shall have no liability under this
Agreement for any individual Loss or series of related Losses of less than

9.2.4. Any claim by any Buyer Indemnitees will be asserted solely and

Agreement and the Escrow Funds then remaining will be the Buyer Indemnitees
sole and exclusive source of recovery for any amounts owing to Buyer

agreement of any Seller contained in Sections 8.3.2, 8.10 or 8.14, (D) Section

Section 9.2.1(ii), in each case in this clause or (b) in respect of matters
specified in Section 9.2.2, any indemnification of the Buyer Indemnitees will

Account (the "Escrow Funds"), in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement (and thereafter, to the extent a claim is expressly not







limited to the Escrow Fund pursuant to the proviso in the sentence above from
the Sellers directly).

9.2.5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
other than claims for Fraud, no claim will be brought or maintained by any
party hereto, any Buyer Indemnitee, any Seller Indemitee, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates or their respective
successors or permitted assigns against any officer, director, employee
(present or former), direct or indirect owners, or Affiliate of any Acquired
Company, or of any Affiliate of any of the above, as applicable (each of whom
is deemed a third-party beneficiary of this Section 9.2.5), which is not
otherwise expressly identified as a party hereto, and no recourse will be
brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of any party hereto set forth or contained
in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto or any certificate
delivered hereunder.

9.2.6. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the maximum
liability of any Seller under this Agreement shall be the amount of the
proceeds received by such Seller under Section 2.

9.2.7. All payments under this Section 9.2 will be treated by the parties as
an adjustment to the proceeds received by the Sellers pursuant to Article 2.

9.3. Indemnification of the Sellers.

9.3.1. From and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this
Article 9), Crane will indemnify each Seller, its direct or indirect owners,
its and their respective Affiliates, and its and their officers, directors,
employees and agents (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") against and hold
them harmless from any Losses suffered or incurred by any such Seller
Indemnitee to the extent such Loss directly relates to (a) any breach of any
representation or warranty of any Buyer contained in this Agreement or the
Buyers Closing Certificate (in each case, assuming that all qualifications
contained herein or therein as to materiality, including each qualifying
reference to the defined term "Material Adverse Effect," the words "material"
and "materiality" and all similar phrases and words, were deleted therefrom)
and (b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of any Buyer contained in this
Agreement requiring performance by any Buyer Party or any breach of any
covenant or agreement of any Acquired Company contained in this Agreement
requiring performance by any Acquired Company after the Closing . All payments
under this Section 9.3 will be treated by the parties hereto as an adjustment
to the proceeds received by the Sellers pursuant to Article 2.

9.3.2. No Seller shall have any right of indemnification or contribution
against any Acquired Company with respect to any breach by the Sellers or the
Acquired Companies of any of their representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules or in any
certificate, instrument or other document delivered by or on behalf of any
Seller or the Acquired Companies pursuant to this Agreement, whether by virtue
of any contractual or statutory right of indemnity or otherwise, and all
claims to the contrary are hereby waived and released.







9.4. Expiration of Claims. The ability of any Seller Indemnitee or Buyer
Indemnitee to receive indemnification under Sections 9.2 or 9.3, as
applicable, will terminate on the applicable survival termination date (as set
forth in Section 9.1), unless such Seller Indemnitee or a Buyer Indemnitee, as
applicable, will have either (a) suffered or incurred a Loss or, based upon
facts or circumstances existing at such time, reasonably expects to suffer or
incur a Loss (which, in the case of any claim related to Taxes, must be based
on issues actually raised in outstanding Tax Proceedings), in either case
prior to the termination date and made a proper claim for indemnification
pursuant to Sections 9.2 or 9.3, prior to such termination date, as applicable
or (b) delivered a notice to the indemnifying party that, as a result of a
notice, claim, demand or other communication made by a Person not a party to
this Agreement, the Seller Indemnitee or Buyer Indemitee, as applicable,
reasonably expects to suffer or incur Losses, in which case such claim, if
then unresolved, will not be extinguished by the passage of the deadlines set
forth in Section 9.1. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, all claims by any Buyer Indemnitee other than (i) claims pursuant to
Section 9.2.1(v) or Section 9.2.1(vi), (ii) claims specified in the proviso to
the first sentence of Section 9.2.4, and (iii) claims asserted on or before
March 31, 2014, will immediately terminate and expire on March 31, 2014.

9.5. Inter-Party Claims.

9.5.1. In order for a party hereto to be entitled to seek any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement (such party, the "Claiming Party"), such
Claiming Party must give written notice (a "Claim Notice") to the other party
or parties from whom such indemnification is sought (with respect to the
Sellers, to the Sellers' Representatives) (the "Defending Party") in writing
promptly after occurrence of the event giving rise to such Claiming Party's
claim for indemnification, specifying in reasonable detail the basis of such
claim and certifying that such claim is being made in good faith; provided
that failure to give, or delay in giving, such notification will not, subject
to Section 9.4, affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the
extent the Defending Party will have been actually prejudiced as a result of
such failure or delay or the indemnification obligations are materially
increased as a result of such failure or delay. The Claiming Party will
thereupon give the Defending Party (or with respect to the Sellers, the
Sellers' Representatives) reasonable access during normal business hours to
the books, records and assets of the Claiming Party which evidence or support
such claim or the act, omission or occurrence giving rise to such claim and
the right, upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, to
interview, with representatives of Crane present, any employee of the Claiming
Party materially related thereto at a mutually convenient time.

9.5.2. After delivery of a Claim Notice, the Defending Party will deliver to
the Claiming Party a written response in which the Defending Party will
either:













(a) agree that the Claiming Party is entitled to receive all of the Losses at
issue in the Claim Notice; or

(b) dispute the Claiming Party's entitlement to indemnification by delivering
to the Claiming Party a written notice (an "Objection Notice") setting forth
in reasonable detail each disputed item, the basis for each such disputed item
and certifying that all such disputed items are being disputed in good faith.

9.5.3. If the Defending Party delivers an Objection Notice to the Claiming
Party, or fails to respond to the Objection Notice within 30 days after
delivery thereof, then the dispute may be resolved by any legally available
means consistent with the provisions of Section 11.9.

9.6. Third Party Claims.

9.6.1. In order for a Claiming Party to seek any indemnification provided for
under this Agreement in respect of a claim or demand made by any Person who is
not a party hereto or an Affiliate of such party against the Claiming Party (a
"Third Party Claim"), such Claiming Party must notify the Defending Party (or
with respect to the Sellers, the Sellers' Representatives) in writing, and in
reasonable detail, of the Third Party Claim as promptly as reasonably possible
after receipt by such Claiming Party of notice of the Third Party Claim;
provided that failure to give such notification on a timely basis will not,
subject to Section 9.4, affect the indemnification provided hereunder except
to the extent the Defending Party will have been actually prejudiced as a
result of such failure. Thereafter, the Claiming Party will deliver to the
Defending Party, within 5 business days after the Claiming Party's receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the Claiming Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

9.6.2. If a Third Party Claim is made against a Claiming Party, the Defending
Party (or with respect to the Sellers, the Sellers' Representatives) will be
entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses within 30
days after its receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim from the Claiming
Party, to assume the defense thereof (subject to a reservation of rights) with
counsel selected by the Defending Party and reasonably satisfactory to the
Claiming Party. However, in no event may the Defending Party assume or
maintain control of the defense of any Third Party Claim (A) involving
criminal liability or (B) in which any relief other than monetary damages is
sought against the Claiming Party. Should a Defending Party (or with respect
to the Sellers, the Sellers' Representatives) so elect to assume the defense
of a Third Party Claim, the Defending Party will not be liable to the Claiming
Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Claiming Party in
connection with the defense thereof. If the Defending Party (or with respect
to the Sellers, the Sellers' Representatives) assumes such defense, the
Claiming Party will have the right to participate in the defense thereof and
to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by
the Defending Party, it being understood, however, that the Defending Party
will control such defense. The Defending Party will be liable for







the fees and expenses of one counsel employed by the Claiming Party for any
period during which the Defending Party has not assumed the defense thereof.
If the Defending Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, then all the
parties hereto will cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third
Party Claim, including by retaining and (upon the Defending Party's request)
providing to the Defending Party all records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and, if reasonably necessary,
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Whether or not the Sellers' Representatives will have assumed the defense of a
Third Party Claim, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates will admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Sellers' Representatives (not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). If the Defending Party
is controlling the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Defending Party will
not agree to any compromise or settlement of, or the entry of any judgment
arising from, the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Claiming Party, which consent the Claiming Party will not unreasonably
withhold, condition or delay, unless (i) the terms of the judgment or proposed
compromise or settlement include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
to the Claiming Party by the third party of a full, complete and unconditional
release of the Claiming Party (and its Affiliates) from all liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim, (ii) there is no finding or admission of
(A) any violation of law by the Claiming Party (or any of its Affiliates) or
(B) any violation of the rights of any Person by the Claiming Party (or any of
its Affiliates), and (iii) the sole form of relief is monetary damages which
are paid in full by the Defending Party. The Claiming Party will have no
liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim effected without its consent
(solely to the extent required pursuant to previous sentence).

9.7. Mitigation. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will, to
the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements, take all commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of any event
which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are
indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith.

9.8. Determination of Loss Amount.

9.8.1. The amount of any and all Losses under this Article 9 will be
determined net of (i) the net present value of any Tax benefits actually
realizable by any Person seeking indemnification hereunder arising from the
deductibility (or amortization or capitalization or other Tax benefit) of any
such Losses and (ii) any amounts recovered (net of the costs of recovery) by
any Claiming Party or any of such Claiming Party's Affiliates under or
pursuant to any insurance policy, title insurance policy, indemnity,
reimbursement arrangement or contract (other than self-insurance or
retrospective insurance arrangements) pursuant to which or under which such
Claiming Party or such Claiming Party's Affiliates is a party or has rights.

9.8.2. A Claiming Party shall not be entitled to recover Losses hereunder to
the extent such Losses (i) are not the reasonably foreseeable result of any
breach by the







Defending Party of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement or arise from special circumstances of the Claiming Party
that were not communicated prior to the date of this Agreement by the Claiming
Party to the Defending Party, or (ii) constitute punitive or exemplary
damages; provided, however, that a Claiming Party shall be entitled to recover
any such Losses recovered by third parties in connection with a Third Party
Claim against the Claiming Party. No Defending Party will be liable hereunder
in respect of any claim if such claim would not have arisen but for a post-
Closing change in legislation or GAAP or a change in interpretation of
applicable Legal Requirements as determined by a court or pursuant to an
administration rule-making decision.

9.8.3. No Buyer Indemnitee will be entitled to any indemnification under this
Article 9 to the extent such matter (i) was taken into account in determining

and fees (including legal and accounting fees and expenses) incurred by such

performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions.

11.3. Entire Agreement. The agreement of the parties that is comprised of this
Agreement and its exhibits and schedules sets forth the entire agreement and
understanding between the parties and their respective Affiliates with respect
to the subject matter thereof and supersedes any and all prior agreements,

Confidentiality Agreement), whether oral or written, relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement.







11.4. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or under
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement will
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal

adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Sellers'

nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, including by way of
subrogation.

11.7. Assignment. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the successors and permissible assigns of the parties
hereto. This Agreement and any rights and obligations hereunder may not be
assigned, hypothecated or otherwise transferred by any party hereto (by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written agreement of Crane
and the Sellers' Representatives; provided, that (i) any Sellers'
Representative may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to
any Affiliate thereof in its capacity as a Sellers' Representative, and (ii)
any Seller may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any
Affiliate thereof who purchases the Shares or Japan Options of such Seller,
if, in the case of both clauses (i) and (ii), such transferee Affiliate
executes a joinder signature page to this Agreement agreeing to be bound
hereby as a Seller or Sellers' Representative (as applicable) to the same
extent as such transferor (and upon the execution of such joinder, the
transferor shall have no liability hereunder other than any liability
resulting from actions taken prior to such transfer); and provided further,
that any Buyer may assign its rights under this Agreement to any Affiliate if
such assignee executes a joinder signature page to this Agreement agreeing to
be bound hereby as a Buyer to the same extent as such transferor (provided,
that no assignment of this Agreement by Crane will relieve Crane of any
Liability under this Agreement). Any purported assignment in breach of this
Section 11.7 shall be null and void.

part out of, related to, based upon, or in connection herewith or the subject
matter hereof will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of

provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction other
than the State of New York.







11.9. Consent to Jurisdiction. Each party to this Agreement, by its execution
hereof, hereby (a) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
state courts of the State of New York, New York County or the United States
District Court located in the State of New York, New York County for the
purpose of any and all actions, suits or proceedings arising in whole or in
part out of, related to, based upon or in connection with this Agreement or
the subject matter hereof, (b) waives to the extent not prohibited by
applicable Legal Requirements, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as
a defense or otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is
exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that any such action brought in
one of the above-named courts should be dismissed on grounds of forum non
conveniens, should be transferred to any court other than one of the above-
named courts, or should be stayed by reason of the pendency of some other
proceeding in any other court other than one of the above-named courts, or
that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by
such court and (c) agrees not to commence any such action other than before
one of the above-named courts nor to make any motion or take any other action
seeking or intending to cause the transfer or removal of any such action to
any court other than one of the above-named courts whether on the grounds of
inconvenient forum or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any party may
enforce a judgment of one of the above-named courts in any jurisdiction. Each
party hereby (x) consents to service of process in any such action in any
manner permitted by the laws of the State of New York, (y) agrees that service
of process made in accordance with clause (x) or made pursuant to Section
11.1, will constitute good and valid service of process in any such action and
(z) waives and agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense, or
otherwise) in any such action any claim that service of process made in
accordance with clause (x) or clause (y) does not constitute good and valid
service of process.

11.10. Waiver of Jury Trial. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LEGAL
REQUIREMENTS WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES
AND COVENANTS THAT IT, HE OR SHE SHALL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF,
DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF
ANY ISSUE, ACTION, CLAIM, CAUSE OF ACTION, SUIT (IN CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE), INQUIRY, PROCEEDING OR INVESTIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED
WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, IN EACH
CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN

EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY.

11.11. Reliance. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that it has been
informed by each other party that the provisions of Sections 11.9 and 11.10
constitute a material inducement upon which such party is relying and will
rely in entering into this Agreement, and each such party agrees that any
breach by such party of any of the provisions of Sections 11.9 or 11.10 above
would constitute a material breach of this Agreement.







11.12. Specific Enforcement. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that
the other parties would be damaged irreparably in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached or violated. Accordingly, each of

the other parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or violations of the provisions of this Agreement and to the remedy
of specific performance of this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof
in any action instituted in any court specified in Section 11.9 in addition to
any other remedy to which such party may be entitled, at law or in equity.
Each party further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific
performance in respect of such breach or violation, it shall not assert the
defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

11.13. No Waiver. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the
exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be construed to be a
waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any
such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
right. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar), or
shall constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided. No
waiver of any right or remedy hereunder shall be valid unless the same shall
be in writing and signed by the party against whom such waiver is intended to
be effective (or in the case of the Sellers, by the Sellers' Representatives).

11.14. Negotiation of Agreement. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

Disclosure Schedules will not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment that

corresponding to the sections contained in this Agreement merely for
convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the Disclosure
Schedules as an exception to a particular covenant, agreement, representation
or warranty will not be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with
respect to all other covenants, agreements, representations and warranties
unless the relevance of such item to such other covenants, representations,
agreements or warranties is reasonably apparent, notwithstanding the presence
or absence of an appropriate cross-reference thereto.

11.16. Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are inserted only
for reference as a matter of convenience and in no way define, limit or
describe the scope or intent of this Agreement, and will not affect in any way
the construction, meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

any number of counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original for all purposes and
all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. This
