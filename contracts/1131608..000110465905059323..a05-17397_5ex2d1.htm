necessary to conduct the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
presently conducted (collectively, the " _Permits_ ") have been duly
obtained, are held by the Company or its Subsidiaries and are in full force

## 2.10 _Employee Benefits_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Company Benefit Plans; Employment Agreements_.  Schedule 2.10(a)(i)
of the Disclosure Letter contains a complete and accurate list of each
material Plan that is maintained, contributed to or established by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and under which any current or former
officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
the beneficiaries or dependents of any such person, is or will become
eligible to participate or derive a benefit, or under which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has any obligation or liability,
in each case, other

  



  

17   

     
   

  



  

### than any government sponsored plan or arrangement (" _Company Benefit
Plans_ "). Schedule 2.10(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth all
written employment, severance and retention agreements other than any such
agreement ( _x_ ) that, by its terms, may be terminated or canceled by the
Company or any Subsidiary with notice of not more than the greater of 120
days and the period of notice required under applicable law, in each case
without penalty and ( _y_ ) providing for the payment of annual salary and
bonus or severance payments less than $250,000 in any one case (" _Company
Employment Agreements_ ").

  

### 

  

### (b) _Compliance; Liability_. Each Company Benefit Plan has been operated
and administered in accordance with its terms and with applicable law,
including ERISA and the Code, except for any failure to do so that would not
have a Material Adverse Effect.  All contributions required to have been made
by the Company and its Subsidiaries under any Company Benefit Plan (including
all employer contributions and employee salary reduction contributions) have
been made within the time periods prescribed by ERISA and the Code to the
respective Company Benefit Plan. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened material legal action, suit, audit, inquiry,
proceeding or claim relating to the Company Benefit Plans (other than routine
claims for benefits).  The Company and its Subsidiaries have engaged in no
transaction with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that, assuming the
taxable period of such transaction has expired as of the date hereof, would
reasonably be expected to subject the Company and its Subsidiaries to a tax
or penalty imposed by either section 4975 of the Code or sections 502(i) or
502(l) of ERISA that would have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach of any Company
Employment Agreement, except for any such breach that would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Tax Qualification_. Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS as to its qualification under the Code and
to the effect that each such trust is exempt from taxation under section
501(a) of the Code, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has
occurred since the date of such determination letter that will adversely
affect such qualification or tax-exempt status.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Title IV of ERISA_. Within the past five years, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries or its ERISA Affiliates has sponsored,
maintained, contributed to or otherwise incurred any material liability under
any "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2)
of ERISA that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or to the funding requirements
of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, and no event, transaction
or condition exists that would result in any material liability to the
Surviving Corporation or any ERISA Affiliate under any such plan following
the Closing. No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA or "multiple employer plan" under Section 4063 of
ERISA and none of

  



  

18   

     
   

  



  

### the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates has any material obligation
under Section 4201 of ERISA.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Triggering Events_. Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the
performance of the obligations hereunder by the Company or its Subsidiaries
shall by itself require a payment, or cause the accelerated vesting of a
right to a payment, under any Company Benefit Plan or under any Company
Employment Agreement. The performance of the obligations hereunder by the
Company or its Subsidiaries will not result in any payment under any Company
Benefit Plan or under any Company Employment Agreement that would constitute
an "excess parachute payment" for purposes of Section 280G or 4999 of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has promised or
announced any type of plan or binding commitment to create any additional
Company Benefit Plan, or to enter into any agreement with an employee, or to
amend or modify any existing Company Benefit Plan or agreement.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Documents_. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company
has delivered or made available to the Buyer true and complete copies of the
following documents, to the extent applicable: ( _i_ ) the most recent Plan
document and all amendments thereto; ( _ii_ ) the most recent trust
instrument and insurance contracts; ( _iii_ ) the three most recent Form 5500
filed with the IRS (and accompanying audited financial statements, if
required), ( _iv_ ) the three most recent actuarial reports (if applicable),
( _v_ ) the most recent summary plan description; and ( _vi_ ) the most
recent determination letter issued by the IRS (or, if no such letter has been
issued for a Company Benefit Plan, the pending application, if any, to the
IRS requesting such letter). The Company has made available to the Buyer
true and complete copies of the Company Employment Agreements.

  

### 

  

### (g) _COBRA_. Except for health care continuation requirements under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, as amended (" _COBRA_ ") or
similar state law, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any Company Benefit
Plans.

before the National Labor Relations Board. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is neither party to nor bound by any Contract or other agreement
with any labor union representing its employees or collective bargaining
agreement and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no activities or
proceedings of any labor union to organize any such employees.

the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any Leases, except
for such failures to be in full force and effect and defaults as would not,

guarantees to the Company, the due and punctual performance and discharge of
all obligations of the Buyer under the last sentence of Section 4.8(b) and
under Section 7.3(a) (the " _Obligations_ "). The Guarantor acknowledges that
its liability hereunder shall be limited to, and extend to, the full amount
of the Obligations, and that the Company may, in its sole discretion, bring
and prosecute a separate action or actions against the Guarantor for the
full amount of the Obligations, regardless of whether action is brought
against the Buyer or the Buyer is joined in any such action or actions. The
Company shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the Obligations
in the event that the Buyer becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization
or similar proceeding, and the failure of the Company to so file shall not
affect the Guarantors obligations under this Section 4.10. In the
event that any payment to the Company in respect of the Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, the
Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect to the Obligations as if
such payment had not been made.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Guarantor agrees that the Company may at any time and from time
to time, without notice to or further consent of the Guarantor, extend the
time for performance of any of the Obligations, and may also make any
agreement with the Buyer, for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise,
discharge or release thereof, in whole or in part, or for any modification of
the terms thereof or of any agreement between the Company and the Buyer
without in any way impairing or affecting the Guarantors obligations under
this Section 4.10. The Guarantor agrees that the obligations of the Guarantor
under this Section 4.10 shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in
part, or otherwise affected by: ( _i_ ) the failure of the Company to assert
any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Buyer; (
_ii_ ) any change in the time, place or manner of performance of any of the
Obligations or any rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other
amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement
or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in
connection with any of the Obligations; ( _iii_ ) any change in the corporate
existence, structure or ownership of the Buyer; (i _v_ ) any insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the Buyer; (
_v_ ) the existence of any claim, set-off or other right which the Guarantor
may have at any time against the Buyer or the Company, whether in connection
with the Obligations or otherwise; ( _vi_ ) the adequacy of any other means
the Company may have of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations; ( _vii_
) any other act or omission that might in any manner or to any extent vary
the risk of the Guarantor or otherwise operate as a release or discharge of
the Guarantor, all of which may be done without notice to the Guarantor; or (
_ix_ ) any other event or circumstances, whether similar or dissimilar to the
foregoing.

  



  

39   

     
   

  



  

### (c) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Guarantor hereby
expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any law
which would otherwise require any election of remedies by the Company. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, the Guarantor waives promptness, diligence,
notice of the acceptance of the guarantee contained in this Section 4.10 and
of the Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-
performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of any
Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind (except for notices to
be provided to the Buyer in accordance with Section 9.4), all defenses which
may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium law or other
similar law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling
of assets of the Buyer, and all suretyship defenses generally (other than
fraud or willful misconduct by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
defenses to the payment of the Obligations that are available to the Buyer
under this Agreement). The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
waives any duty on the part of the Company to disclose to the Guarantor any
matter, fact or thing related to the business, condition (financial or
otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of the Buyer or
any of its affiliates now or hereafter known by the Company. The Guarantor
acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the waivers set
forth in this Section 4.10 are knowingly made in contemplation of such
benefits.

  

### 

  

### (d) The Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not
institute, and shall cause its respective affiliates not to institute, any
proceeding asserting that the guarantee contained in this Section 4.10 is
illegal, invalid or unenforceable in accordance with its terms, subject
to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally, and general equitable principles (whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law). The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or
hereafter acquire against the Company that arise from the existence, payment,
performance, or enforcement of the Guarantors obligations under or in
respect of the guarantee contained in this Section 4.10 or any other
agreement in connection therewith, including any right of
subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and
any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the Company against the
Buyer, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under
contract, statute or common law, including the right to take or receive from
the Buyer, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or
in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or
right, unless and until all of the amounts payable under the guarantee
contained in this Section 4.10 shall have been paid in full in cash. If any
amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the
immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to the payment in full in
cash of the Guarantors obligations under the guarantee contained in this
Section 4.10, such amount shall be received and held in trust for the benefit
of the Company, shall be segregated from other property and funds of the
Guarantor and shall forthwith be paid or delivered to the Company in the same
form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or

4.10 thereafter arising.

neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall be required to make any
monetary expenditure to any Person.
