 Section 4.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock of Universal, Hanover and Merger Subs_. 

  

 (a) At the Initial Effective Time, the holders of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Universal ("Universal Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time (other than shares of Universal Common Stock to be canceled without payment of any consideration therefor pursuant to Section 4.1(c)) shall, by virtue of the Universal Merger, have the right to receive one (1.00) (the "Universal Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Holdco ("Holdco Common Stock") in exchange for each share of Universal Common Stock. Each such share of Universal Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such share of Universal Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such share of Universal Common Stock, except the right to receive, without interest, certificates for shares of Holdco Common Stock in accordance with Section 4.2, any unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Holdco Common Stock in accordance with Section 4.2(c) and cash for fractional shares in accordance with Section 4.2(e) upon the surrender of the relevant Certificate. At the Initial Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Universal Merger Sub shall be converted, by reason of the Universal Merger, into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Universal Surviving Entity. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, the holders of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Hanover ("Hanover Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Hanover Common Stock to be canceled without payment of any consideration therefor pursuant to Section 4.1(c)) shall, by virtue of the Hanover Merger, have the right to receive 0.325 (the "Hanover Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Holdco Common Stock in exchange for each share of Hanover 

     ##### 

  

    

Common Stock. Each such share of Hanover Common Stock shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of any such share of Hanover Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such share of Hanover Common Stock, except the right
to receive, without interest, certificates for shares of Holdco Common Stock
in accordance with Section 4.2, any unpaid dividends and distributions on
shares of Holdco Common Stock in accordance with Section 4.2(c) and cash
for fractional shares in accordance with Section 4.2(e) upon the surrender of
the relevant Certificate. At the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Hanover Merger Sub shall
be converted, by reason of the Hanover Merger, into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Hanover
Surviving Entity. 

   

 (c) At the Initial Effective Time, Universal shall contribute to Holdco each share of Holdco Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time. Each share of Universal Common Stock issued and held in UniversalÂ’s treasury shall, at the Initial Effective Time and by virtue of the Universal Merger, cease to be issued and shall be canceled without payment of any consideration therefor, and no shares of Holdco Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of Hanover Common Stock issued and held in HanoverÂ’s treasury shall, at the Effective Time and by virtue of the Hanover Merger, cease to be issued and shall be canceled without payment of any consideration therefor, and no shares of Holdco Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (d) Except as hereinafter provided with respect to options outstanding under the Universal Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Universal ESPP"), all options to acquire shares of Universal Common Stock outstanding at the Initial Effective Time identified in Section 4.1(d) of the Universal Disclosure Letter and all options to acquire shares of Universal Common Stock issued hereafter under UniversalÂ’s equity plans (collectively, the "Universal Stock Plans") pursuant to Section 7.1(f) (individually, a "Universal Option" and collectively, the "Universal Options") shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time, subject to the modifications described in this Section 4.1(d). Prior to the Initial Effective Time, Holdco and Universal shall take all actions (if any) as may be required to permit the assumption of such Universal Options by Holdco pursuant to this Section 4.1(d) so that at the Initial Effective Time, the Universal Stock Plans (other than the Universal ESPP) shall be assumed by Holdco (with such adjustments thereto as may be required to reflect the Universal Merger, including the substitution of Holdco Common Stock for Universal Common Stock thereunder) and the Universal Options (other than the Universal Options granted under the Universal ESPP) shall be assumed and adjusted by Holdco, subject to the same terms and conditions as under the applicable Universal Stock Plan and the applicable option agreement entered into pursuant thereto, except that immediately following the Initial Effective Time (A) each such Universal Option shall be exercisable only for that whole number of shares of Holdco Common Stock equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole share) of the number of shares of Universal Common Stock subject to such Universal Option immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time multiplied by the Universal Exchange Ratio, and (B) the exercise price per share of Holdco Common Stock shall be an amount equal to the exercise price per share of Universal Common Stock subject to such Universal Option in effect immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time divided by the Universal Exchange Ratio (the price per share, as so determined, being rounded down to the 

    ##### 

  

    

nearest whole cent); provided, that in no event shall the exercise price be
less than the par value of Holdco Common Stock. The adjustments provided in
this paragraph with respect to any Universal Options that are
"incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of the Code shall be and
are intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section
424(a) of the Code. Prior to the Initial Effective Time, Universal shall take
all actions as may be required to terminate the Universal ESPP and
all outstanding Universal Options thereunder effective immediately prior to
the Initial Effective Time in accordance with the terms of Section 8.01 of
the Universal ESPP. From and after the date of this Agreement, Universal and
its Subsidiaries shall take no action to provide for the acceleration of the
exercisability of any Universal Options in connection with the Universal
Merger (except to the extent such acceleration is required under the terms of
such Universal Options or change in control agreement as of the date of this
Agreement). To the extent such acceleration is required under the terms of
such Universal Options or other awards made under the Universal Stock Plans
upon the occurrence of a change of control (as such term is defined in the
applicable Universal Stock Plan or change in control agreement), Universal
shall, prior to the Initial Effective Time, take all actions (if any) as may
be required to cause such acceleration to occur at the Initial Effective Time
and immediately prior to the assumption of the Universal Stock Plan by Holdco
(to the extent permitted under the terms of such Universal Stock Plan as of
the date of this Agreement). Prior to the Closing, Holdco shall file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Registration Statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor form) covering the shares of Holdco Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Universal Options and other awards made under
the Universal Stock Plans prior to the Initial Effective Time to be assumed
pursuant to this paragraph and shall cause such registration statement to
remain effective for as long as there are outstanding any such Universal
Options. Except as otherwise specifically provided by this Section 4.1(d),
the terms of the Universal Options and the relevant Universal Stock Plans, as
in effect at the Initial Effective Time, shall remain in full force and
effect with respect to the Universal Options after giving effect to the
Universal Merger and the assumptions by Holdco as set forth above. As soon as
practicable following the Initial Effective Time, Holdco shall deliver to
the holders of Universal Options to be assumed pursuant to this paragraph
appropriate notices setting forth such holdersÂ’ rights pursuant to the
respective Universal Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of
such Universal Options and stating that such Universal Options and such
agreements shall be assumed by Holdco and shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by
this Section 4.1(d)). 

   

 (e) All options to acquire shares of Hanover Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time identified in Section 4.1(e) of the Hanover Disclosure Letter and all options to acquire shares of Hanover Common Stock issued hereafter under HanoverÂ’s equity plans (collectively, the "Hanover Stock Plans") pursuant to Section 7.1(f) (individually, a "Hanover Option" and collectively, the "Hanover Options") shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time, subject to the modifications described in this Section 4.1(e). Prior to the Effective Time, Holdco, Hanover and Universal shall take all actions (if any) as may be required to permit the assumption of such Hanover Options by Holdco pursuant to this Section 4.1(e) so that at the Effective Time, the Hanover Stock Plans shall be assumed by Holdco (with such adjustments thereto as may be required to reflect the Hanover Merger, including the substitution of Holdco Common Stock for Hanover Common Stock thereunder) and the Hanover Options shall be assumed and adjusted by Holdco, subject to the same terms and conditions as under the applicable Hanover Stock Plan and the applicable option agreement entered into pursuant 

     ##### 

  

    

thereto, except that immediately following the Effective Time (A) each such
Hanover Option shall be exercisable only for that whole number of shares of
Holdco Common Stock equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole share)
of the number of shares of Hanover Common Stock subject to such Hanover
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Hanover
Exchange Ratio, and (B) the exercise price per share of Holdco Common Stock
shall be an amount equal to the exercise price per share of Hanover Common
Stock subject to such Hanover Option in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Hanover Exchange Ratio (the price per share, as
so determined, being rounded down to the nearest whole cent); provided, that
in no event shall the exercise price be less than the par value of Holdco
Common Stock. The adjustments provided in this paragraph with respect to any
Hanover Options that are "incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422
of the Code shall be and are intended to be effected in a manner which
is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. From and after the date of
this Agreement, Hanover and its Subsidiaries shall take no action to provide
for the acceleration of the exercisability of any Hanover Options in
connection with the Hanover Merger (except to the extent such acceleration
is required under the terms of such Hanover Options as of the date of this
Agreement). To the extent such acceleration is required under the terms of
such Hanover Options or other awards made under the Hanover Stock Plans upon
the occurrence of a change of control (as such term is defined in
the applicable Hanover Stock Plan), prior to the Effective Time, Hanover
shall take all actions (if any) as may be required to cause such acceleration
to occur at the Effective Time and immediately prior to the assumption of the
Hanover Stock Plan by Holdco (to the extent permitted under the terms of such
Hanover Stock Plan as of the date of this Agreement). Prior to the Closing,
Holdco shall file with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor form) covering the shares of Holdco Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of Hanover Options and other awards made under the Hanover Stock
Plans prior to the Effective Time to be assumed pursuant to this paragraph
and shall cause such registration statement to remain effective for as long
as there are outstanding any such Hanover Options. Except as otherwise
specifically provided by this Section 4.1(e), the terms of the Hanover
Options and the relevant Hanover Stock Plans, as in effect at the
Effective Time, shall remain in full force and effect with respect to
Hanover Options after giving effect to the Hanover Merger and the assumptions
by Holdco as set forth above. As soon as practicable following the Effective
Time, Holdco shall deliver to the holders of Hanover Options appropriate
notices setting forth such holdersÂ’ rights pursuant to the respective Hanover
Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Hanover Options
and stating that such Hanover Options and such agreements shall be assumed by
Holdco and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject
to the adjustments required by this Section 4.1(e)). 

   

 (f) Effective upon consummation of the Mergers, Holdco shall execute and deliver supplemental indentures (the "Supplemental Indentures") whereby it shall agree to be bound by the conversion provisions of HanoverÂ’s 7.25% Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2029, 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 and 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2008 (collectively, the "Convertible Notes") and take all other action necessary, such that following the Effective Time, each outstanding Convertible Note will be convertible into a whole number of shares of Holdco Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock (determined in accordance with Section 4.2(e)) equal to the product of the number of shares of Hanover Common Stock that a holder of such Convertible Note would have had the right to receive had such Convertible Note been converted into Hanover Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Hanover Exchange Ratio. At or 

     ##### 

  

    

prior to the Effective Time, Hanover and Holdco shall comply with all the
provisions of the indentures governing the Convertible Notes relating to the
assumption of the obligations under such indentures arising from the Hanover
Merger. 

    

 Section 4.2 _Exchange of Certificates Representing Hanover Common Stock and Universal Common Stock_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Initial Effective Time, Holdco shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to Hanover to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent"). Holdco shall, when and as needed, deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Hanover Common Stock and Universal Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this Article 4, certificates representing the shares of Holdco Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 4.1 and delivered pursuant to this Section 4.2 in exchange for outstanding shares of Hanover Common Stock and Universal Common Stock, respectively. When and as needed, Holdco shall provide the Exchange Agent immediately following the Effective Time cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock in accordance with Section 4.2(e) (such cash and certificates for shares of Holdco Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). 

   

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Holdco shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more certificates ("Certificates") that immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time or the Effective Time, as applicable, represented shares of Hanover Common Stock or Universal Common Stock: (A) a letter of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal"), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Holdco may reasonably specify and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Holdco Common Stock, any unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Holdco Common Stock in accordance with Section 4.2(c) and cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 4.2(e). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Holdco Common Stock and (y) a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 4, after giving effect to any required withholding tax, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Hanover Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of Hanover or a transfer of ownership of Universal Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of Universal, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Holdco Common Stock, together with a check for the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares, may be issued to such a transferee if the Certificate representing such Hanover Common Stock or Universal Common Stock, as the case may be, is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, no dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to shares of Holdco Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Holdco Common Stock issuable upon surrender of such Certificate as a result of the conversion provided in this Article 4 until such Certificate is surrendered as provided herein. Subject to the effect of Applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the Certificate so surrendered, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date prior to surrender payable with respect to the number of whole shares of Holdco Common Stock issued pursuant to Section 4.1, less the amount of any withholding taxes, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Holdco Common Stock, less the amount of any withholding taxes. 

   

 (d) (i) At or after the Effective Time, the Hanover Surviving Entity shall pay from funds on hand at the Effective Time any dividends or make other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by Hanover on shares of Hanover Common Stock which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Hanover Surviving Entity of the shares of Hanover Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) at or after the Initial Effective Time, the Universal Surviving Entity shall pay from funds on hand at the Initial Effective Time any dividends or make other distributions with a record date prior to the Initial Effective Time that may have been declared or made by Universal on shares of Universal Common Stock which remain unpaid at the Initial Effective Time, and after the Initial Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Universal Surviving Entity of the shares of Universal Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Holdco, the presented Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged for certificates representing shares of Holdco Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article 4. Certificates surrendered for exchange by any person constituting an "affiliate" of Hanover or Universal for purposes of Rule 145(c) under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), shall not be exchanged until Hanover or Universal, as applicable, has received a written agreement from such person as provided in Section 7.11. 

   

 (e) No fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock shall be issued pursuant hereto. In lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.1(b), cash adjustments will be paid to holders in respect of any fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable, and the amount of such cash adjustment shall be equal to such fractional proportion of the Average Price of Universal Common Stock multiplied by the Hanover Exchange Ratio. "Average Price" means the average closing price of the Universal Common Stock, as such price is reported on the New York Stock Exchange as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets or such other source as the parties shall agree in writing, for the 15 trading days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the Initial Effective Time. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof and any certificates for shares of Holdco Common Stock) that remains undistributed to the former stockholders of Hanover or Universal one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Holdco. Any former stockholders of Hanover or Universal who have not theretofore complied with this Article 4 shall thereafter look only to Holdco for delivery of certificates representing their shares of Holdco Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares and for any unpaid dividends and distributions on the shares of Holdco Common Stock deliverable to such former stockholder pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (g) None of Holdco, Universal, Hanover, either Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any person for any portion of the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

   

 (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Holdco, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Holdco may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate certificates representing the shares of Holdco Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Holdco Common Stock, as provided in Section 4.2(c), deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 Section 4.3 _Adjustment of Exchange Ratios_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Initial Effective Time (in the case of the Universal Common Stock) or the Effective Time (in the case of the Hanover Common Stock) (and in each case, and as permitted by Section 7.l), the outstanding shares of Universal Common Stock or the outstanding shares of Hanover Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number of shares or different class, in each case, by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable in other securities shall be declared with a record date within such period, or any similar event shall have occurred, the applicable Universal Exchange Ratio or Hanover Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Universal Common Stock or Hanover Common Stock, as the case may be, the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

  

 Section 4.4 _Rule 16b-3 Approval_. Prior to the Closing, Holdco, Hanover and Universal, and their respective Boards of Directors or committees thereof, shall use their reasonable best efforts to take all actions to cause any dispositions of Hanover Common Stock or Universal Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Hanover Common Stock or Universal Common Stock) or acquisitions of Holdco Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Holdco Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in no-action letters issued by the SEC in similar transactions.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HANOVER  

  

 Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to Universal by Hanover at or prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Hanover Disclosure Letter") and making reference to the particular subsection of this Agreement to which exception is being taken (provided that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the Hanover Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to each other section or subsection thereof to which its relevance is reasonably apparent), Hanover represents and warrants to Universal that: 

   

 Section 5.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority_. Hanover is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Hanover is duly qualified to do business and, to the extent such concept or a similar concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction, is in good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a Hanover Material Adverse Effect. Hanover has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. The copies of HanoverÂ’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws previously made available to Universal are true and correct and contain all amendments as of the date of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.2 _Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements_. Hanover has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and, upon receipt of the Hanover Stockholder Approval, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution of this Agreement and the consummation by Hanover of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on behalf of Hanover, other than the receipt of the Hanover Stockholder Approval. Hanover has duly executed and delivered this Agreement. Assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the other parties hereto, this Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Hanover, enforceable against Hanover in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditorsÂ’ rights and general principles of equity. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 6.19, Hanover has taken all action necessary to render the restrictions set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL, and any other applicable takeover law restricting or purporting to restrict business combinations, inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 5.3 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of Hanover consists of 200,000,000 shares of Hanover Common Stock and 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Hanover Preferred Stock"). As of January 31, 2007 (the "Cut-off Time"), there were (i) 103,992,759 outstanding shares of Hanover Common Stock (which includes outstanding restricted stock), (ii) 2,533,037 shares of Hanover Common Stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding Hanover Options and restricted stock units, (iii) no outstanding shares of Hanover Preferred Stock, (iii) 4,369,882 shares of Hanover Common Stock reserved for issuance upon conversion of HanoverÂ’s outstanding 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes

due 2008, (iv) 9,583,338 shares of Hanover Common Stock reserved for issuance
upon conversion of HanoverÂ’s outstanding 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due
2014 and (v) 3,688,654 shares of Hanover Common Stock reserved for issuance
upon conversion of HanoverÂ’s outstanding 7.25% Convertible Junior Subordinated
Notes due 2029. From the Cut-off Time to the date of this Agreement, no
additional shares of Hanover Common Stock have been issued (other than
pursuant to Hanover Options which were outstanding as of the Cut-off Time and
are included in the number of shares of Hanover Common Stock reserved for
issuance upon exercise of outstanding Hanover Options in (ii) above), no
additional Hanover Options have been issued or granted, and there has been no
increase in the number of shares of Hanover Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Hanover Options from the number issuable under such
Hanover Options as of the Cut-off Time. All such issued and outstanding
shares of Hanover Common Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. As of the date of this
Agreement, except as set forth in this Section 5.3, there are no
outstanding shares of capital stock and there are no options, warrants,
calls, subscriptions, convertible securities or other rights, agreements or
commitments which obligate Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,
transfer, sell or register any shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries. Except for the

 Section 5.4 _Subsidiaries_. Each of HanoverÂ’s Subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and, to the extent such concept or a similar concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction, in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has the corporate or other entity power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing (where applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, operation or lease of its property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which such failure to be so qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a Hanover Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each of HanoverÂ’s Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (except as such nonassessability may be affected by Applicable Law), and are owned, directly or indirectly, by Hanover free and clear of all mortgages, deeds of trust, liens, security interests, pledges, leases, conditional sale contracts, charges, privileges, easements, rights of way, reservations, options, rights of first refusal and other encumbrances ("Liens") other than Permitted Liens. 

  

 Section 5.5 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. Except for such matters as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Hanover Material Adverse Effect and except for (i) matters related to taxes, which are treated exclusively in Section 5.10, and (ii) matters arising under Environmental Laws (as defined herein), which are treated exclusively in Section 5.13: 

  

 (a) Neither Hanover nor any Subsidiary of Hanover is in violation of any applicable law, rule, regulation, code, governmental determination, order, treaty, convention, governmental certification requirement or other public limitation, U.S. or non-U.S. (collectively, 

    ##### 

  

    

"Applicable Laws"), and no claim is pending or, to the knowledge of Hanover,
threatened with respect to any such matters. No condition exists which does
or could reasonably be expected to constitute a violation of or deficiency
under any Applicable Law by Hanover or any Subsidiary of Hanover. 

   

 (b) Hanover and each Subsidiary of Hanover hold all permits, licenses, certifications, variations, exemptions, orders, franchises and approvals of all governmental or regulatory authorities necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the "Hanover Permits"). All Hanover Permits are in full force and effect and there exists no default thereunder or breach thereof, and Hanover has no notice or actual knowledge that such Hanover Permits will not be renewed in the ordinary course after the Effective Time. No governmental authority has given, or to the knowledge of Hanover threatened to give, any action to terminate, cancel or reform any Hanover Permit. 

   

 (c) Hanover and each Subsidiary of Hanover possess all permits, licenses, operating authorities, orders, exemptions, franchises, variances, consents, approvals or other authorizations required for the present ownership and operation of all its real property or leaseholds ("Hanover Real Property").

 Section 5.6 _No Conflict_. 

  

 (a) Neither the execution and delivery by Hanover of this Agreement nor the consummation by Hanover of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof will (i) subject to receipt of the Hanover Stockholder Approval, conflict with or result in a breach of any provisions of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Hanover; (ii) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of termination or cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties of Hanover or its Subsidiaries under, or result in being declared void, voidable, or without further binding effect, or otherwise result in a detriment to Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, concession, franchise, permit, lease, contract, agreement, joint venture or other instrument or obligation to which Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their properties may be bound or affected; or (iii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in Section 5.6(b), contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree binding upon or applicable to Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries, except as, in the case of matters described in clause (ii) or (iii), individually or in the aggregate, that have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Hanover Material Adverse Effect. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) Neither the execution and delivery by Hanover of this Agreement nor the consummation by Hanover of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof will require any consent, approval, qualification or authorization of, or filing or registration with, any court or governmental or regulatory authority, other than (i) filings required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or applicable state securities and "Blue Sky" laws, (ii) filings and notifications required under applicable non-U.S. antitrust laws set forth in Section 5.6 of the Hanover Disclosure Letter and Section 6.6 of the Universal Disclosure Letter ((i) and (ii) collectively, the "Regulatory Filings") and (iii) the filing of the Hanover Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, except for any consent, approval, qualification or authorization the failure to obtain which, and for any filing or registration the failure to make which, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a Hanover Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (c) This Agreement, the Mergers and the transactions contemplated hereby do not, and will not, upon consummation of such transactions in accordance with their terms, result in any "change of control" or similar event or circumstance under (i) the terms of any Hanover Material Contract or (ii) any contract or plan under which any employees, officers or directors of Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries are entitled to payments or benefits, which, in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), gives rise to rights or benefits not otherwise available absent such change of control or similar event and requires either a cash payment or an accounting charge in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or (iii) any material Hanover Permit. 

   

 Section 5.7 _SEC Documents_. 

  

 (a) Hanover and its Subsidiaries have filed with the SEC all documents (including exhibits and any amendments thereto) required to be so filed by them since September 30, 2003 pursuant to Sections 13(a), 14(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and have made available to Universal each registration statement, report, proxy statement or information statement (other than preliminary materials) they have so filed, each in the form (including exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC (collectively, the "Hanover Reports"). As of its respective date, each Hanover Report (i) complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except for any statements in any Hanover Report that have been modified by an amendment to such report filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the Hanover Reports (including related notes and schedules) complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Hanover and its Subsidiaries (or such entities as indicated in such balance sheet) as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholdersÂ’ equity included in or incorporated by reference into the Hanover Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the results of operations, cash flows or changes in stockholdersÂ’ equity, as the case may be, of Hanover and its 

      ##### 

  

    

Subsidiaries (or such entities as indicated in such balance sheet) for the
periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
(x) such exceptions as may be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and
(y) normal, recurring year-end audit adjustments which are not material in
the aggregate), in each case in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be
noted therein. Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated
balance sheet of Hanover and its Subsidiaries included in the most recent
Hanover Report filed prior to the date of this Agreement that includes such a
balance sheet, including all notes thereto, as of the date of such balance
sheet, neither Hanover nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities
or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) that would be required to be reflected on, or reserved against in,
a consolidated balance sheet of Hanover or in the notes thereto prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied, other than liabilities or obligations which,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely
to have a Hanover Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) Since September 30, 2003, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Hanover have made all certifications (without qualification or exceptions to the matters certified) required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), and the statements contained in any such certifications are complete and correct; neither Hanover nor its officers have received notice from any governmental authority questioning or challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission of such certification. Hanover maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that all material information concerning Hanover and its Subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for preparing the Hanover Reports and other public disclosure and Hanover is otherwise in substantial compliance with all applicable effective provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. As of the date hereof, Hanover has no knowledge of any material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting. There is no reason to believe that HanoverÂ’s auditors and its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in connection with the filing of HanoverÂ’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. 

   

 (c) Hanover and its Subsidiaries maintain accurate books and records reflecting in all material respects their respective assets and liabilities and maintain proper and adequate internal accounting controls. 

   

 (d) Neither Hanover nor its Subsidiaries has, since July 30, 2002, extended or maintained credit, arranged for the extension of credit, or renewed an extension of credit, in the form of a personal loan to or for any director or executive officer (or equivalent thereof) of Hanover. No loan or extension of credit is maintained by Hanover or its Subsidiaries to which the second sentence of Section 13(k)(1) of the Exchange Act applies. 

   

 Section 5.8 _Litigation_. Except as described in the Hanover Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending against Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries or, to HanoverÂ’s knowledge, threatened against 

   ##### 

  

 

Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries, at law or in equity or in any arbitration
or similar proceedings, before or by any U.S. federal, state or non-U.S.
court, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality or any U.S. or
non-U.S. arbitral or other dispute resolution body, that, individually or in
the aggregate, have had or are reasonably likely to have a Hanover Material
Adverse Effect. 

   

 Section 5.9 _Absence of Certain Changes_. From January 1, 2006 to the date of this Agreement, there has not been (i) a Hanover Material Adverse Effect or (ii) except as described in the Hanover Reports filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, (A) any material change by Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries in any of its accounting methods, principles or practices or any of its tax methods, practices or elections applicable to HanoverÂ’s consolidated financial statements; (B) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or distribution in respect of any capital stock of Hanover or any redemption, purchase or other acquisition of any of its equity securities; (C) any split, combination or reclassification of any capital stock of Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries or any issuance or the authorization of any issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of that capital stock; (D) any damage to or any destruction or loss of physical properties owned or used by Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not covered by insurance, that individually or in the aggregate constitutes a Hanover Material Adverse Effect; or (E) any reevaluations by Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries of any of their assets which, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, Hanover will reflect in its consolidated financial statements, including any impairment of assets, and which in the aggregate are material to them.

 (a) All tax returns, statements, reports, declarations, estimates and forms ("Returns") required to be filed by or with respect to Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries (including any Return required to be filed by an affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group that included Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries) have been properly filed on a timely basis with the appropriate governmental authorities, except to the extent that any failure to file, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a Hanover Material Adverse Effect, and all taxes that have become due (regardless of whether reflected on any Return) have been duly paid or deposited in full on a timely basis or adequately reserved for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, except to the extent that any failure to pay or deposit or make adequate provision for the payment of such taxes, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a Hanover Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) Except to the extent such matters, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Hanover Material Adverse Effect, (i) no audit or other administrative proceeding or court proceeding is presently pending with regard to any tax or Return of Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries as to which any taxing authority has asserted in writing any claim; (ii) no governmental authority is now asserting in writing any deficiency or claim for taxes or any adjustment to taxes with respect to which Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable; and (iii) neither Hanover nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for any tax under Treas.

agreement or any similar agreement or arrangement other than with respect to
any such agreement or arrangement among Hanover and any of its Subsidiaries.
Since December 31, 2005, Hanover has not made or rescinded any material
election relating to taxes or settled or compromised any claim, action, suit,
litigation, proceeding, arbitration, investigation, audit or controversy

Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 6.19, the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Hanover capital stock necessary to approve any transaction contemplated by this Agreement is the affirmative vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Hanover Common Stock (the "Hanover Stockholder Approval"). 

  

 Section 5.21 _Certain Contracts._  

  

 (a) Except for this Agreement and except as filed as an exhibit to the Hanover Reports, neither Hanover nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any "material contract" (as such term is defined in item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) (all contracts of the type described in this Section 5.21(a) being referred to herein as the "Hanover Material Contracts"). 

   

 (b) As of the date of this Agreement, each Hanover Material Contract is in full force and effect, and Hanover and each of its Subsidiaries have in all material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by them to date under each Hanover Material Contract to which they are party, except where such failure to be in full force and effect or such failure to perform, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a Hanover Material Adverse Effect. Except for such matters as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Hanover Material Adverse Effect, neither Hanover nor any of its Subsidiaries (x) knows of, or has received written notice of, any breach of or violation or default under (nor, to the knowledge of Hanover, does there exist any condition which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would result in such a violation or default under) any Hanover Material Contract or (y) has received written notice of the desire of the other party or parties to any such Hanover Material Contract to exercise any rights such party has to cancel, terminate or repudiate such contract or exercise remedies thereunder. Each Hanover Material Contract is enforceable by Hanover or a Subsidiary of Hanover in accordance 

     ##### 

  

    

with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditorsÂ’ rights and general
principles of equity, except where such unenforceability does not constitute,
individually or in the aggregate, a Hanover Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 Section 5.22 _Capital Expenditure Program_. As of the date of this Agreement, Section 5.22 of the Hanover Disclosure Letter accurately sets forth in all material respects the capital expenditures that are forecast to be incurred in 2007 on a quarterly basis. 

  

 Section 5.23 _Improper Payments_. No material bribes, kickbacks or other payments have been made in violation of Applicable Laws by Hanover or any Subsidiary of Hanover or agent of any of them in connection with the conduct of their respective businesses or the operation of their respective assets, and neither Hanover, any Subsidiary of Hanover nor any agent of any of them has received any such payments from vendors, suppliers or other persons. 

  

 Section 5.24 _Takeover Statutes; Rights Plans_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations of Universal in Section 6.19 hereof, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not cause to be applicable to the Hanover Merger the restrictions on "business combinations" set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL or any similar provision (a "Takeover Statute"). Hanover does not have any preferred share purchase rights plan or similar rights plan in effect. 

  

 Section 5.25 _Title, Ownership and Related Matters._  

  

 (a) Hanover and its Subsidiaries have, free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens and Liens, if any, created or permitted to be imposed by Universal, defensible title to their respective inventory, equipment and other tangible and intangible property, including the natural gas compression and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment owned and/or operated by Hanover or its Subsidiaries and related spare parts as may be reduced by the consumption thereof, or increased through the replacement thereof or addition thereto, in the ordinary course of maintenance and operation of their respective businesses, in each case as necessary to permit Hanover and its Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses as currently conducted. As used in this Agreement, the term "Permitted Liens" shall mean Liens for taxes not yet due and payable; statutory Liens of lessors; Liens of carriers, warehousemen, repairmen, mechanics and materialmen arising by operation of law in the ordinary course of business; Liens incurred in the ordinary course of business that secure obligations not yet due and payable; Liens securing indebtedness of Hanover and its Subsidiaries or Universal and its Subsidiaries outstanding as of the date of this Agreement or incurred in accordance with Section 7.1 hereof and Liens incurred or deposits made in the ordinary course of business in connection with workersÂ’ compensation, unemployment insurance and other types of social security.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
 OF UNIVERSAL, HOLDCO AND MERGER SUBS  

  

 Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to Hanover by Universal at or prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Universal Disclosure Letter") and making reference to the particular subsection of this Agreement to which exception is being taken (provided that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the Universal Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to each other section or subsection thereof to which its relevance is reasonably apparent), Universal, Holdco and each Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to Hanover that: 

   

 Section 6.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority_. Each of Universal, Holdco and each Merger Sub is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Universal is duly qualified to do business and, to the extent such concept or a similar concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction, is in good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a Universal Material Adverse Effect. Each of Universal, Holdco and each Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. The copies of the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of Universal, Holdco and each Merger Sub previously made available to Hanover are true and correct and contain all amendments as of the date of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.2 _Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements_. Each of Universal, Holdco and the Merger Subs has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and, upon receipt of the Universal Stockholder Approval, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution of this Agreement and the consummation by each of Universal, Holdco and the Merger Subs of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on behalf of each of them, other than (i) the receipt of the Universal Stockholder Approval, (ii) the adoption of this Agreement by Holdco in its capacity as sole stockholder of each of the Merger Subs and (iii) the approval of the Holdco Charter by Universal in its capacity as sole stockholder of Holdco. Each of Universal, Holdco and the Merger Subs has duly executed and delivered this Agreement. Assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of Hanover, this Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of each of Universal, Holdco and the Merger Subs, enforceable against Universal, Holdco and the Merger Subs in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditorsÂ’ rights and general principles of equity. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.19, Universal has taken all action necessary to render the restrictions set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL, and any other applicable takeover law restricting or purporting to restrict business combinations, inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 6.3 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of Universal consists of 200,000,000 shares of Universal Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Universal Preferred Stock").

As of the date of this Agreement, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each of UniversalÂ’s Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (except as nonassessability may be affected by Applicable Law),

     ##### 

  

     

 Section 6.6 _No Conflict_. 

  

 (a) Neither the execution and delivery by Universal, Holdco and the Merger Subs of this Agreement nor the consummation by any of them of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof will (i) subject to receipt of the Universal Stockholder Approval, conflict with or result in a breach of any provisions of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Holdco, Universal or either Merger Sub; (ii) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of termination or cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties of Universal or its Subsidiaries under, or result in being declared void, voidable, or without further binding effect, or otherwise result in a detriment to Universal or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, concession, franchise, permit, lease, contract, agreement, joint venture or other instrument or obligation to which Universal or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which Universal or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their properties may be bound or affected; or (iii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in Section 6.6(b), contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree binding upon or applicable to Universal or any of its Subsidiaries, except as, in the case of matters described in clause (ii) or (iii), individually or in the aggregate, that have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Universal Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) Neither the execution and delivery by Universal, Holdco or either Merger Sub of this Agreement nor the consummation by any of them of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof will require any consent, approval, qualification or authorization of, or filing or registration with, any court or governmental or regulatory authority, other than (i) the Regulatory Filings, (ii) the filing of a listing application with the New York Stock Exchange pursuant to Section 7.9, and (iii) the filing of the Certificates of Merger and the Holdco Charter with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, except for any consent, approval, qualification or authorization the failure to obtain which, and for any filing or registration the failure to make which, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a Universal Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (c) This Agreement, the Mergers and the transactions contemplated hereby do not, and will not, upon consummation of such transactions in accordance with their terms, result in any "change of control" or similar event or circumstance under (i) the terms of any Universal Material Contract or (ii) any contract or plan under which any employees, officers or directors of Universal or any of its Subsidiaries are entitled to payments or benefits, which, in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), gives rise to rights or benefits not otherwise available absent such change of control or similar event and requires either a cash payment or an accounting charge in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or (iii) any material Universal Permit. 

     ##### 

  

     

 Section 6.7 _SEC Documents_. 

  

 (a) Universal and its Subsidiaries have filed with the SEC all documents (including exhibits and any amendments thereto) required to be so filed by them since September 30, 2003 pursuant to Sections 13(a), 14(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and have made available to Hanover each registration statement, report, proxy statement or information statement (other than preliminary materials) they have so filed, each in the form (including exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC (collectively, the "Universal Reports"). As of its respective date, each Universal Report (i) complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except for any statements in any Universal Report that have been modified by an amendment to such report filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the Universal Reports (including related notes and schedules) complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Universal and its Subsidiaries (or such entities as indicated in such balance sheet) as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholdersÂ’ equity included in or incorporated by reference into the Universal Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the results of operations, cash flows or changes in stockholdersÂ’ equity, as the case may be, of Universal and its Subsidiaries (or such entities as indicated in such balance sheet) for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to (x) such exceptions as may be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and (y) normal, recurring year-end audit adjustments which are not material in the aggregate), in each case in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein. Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet of Universal and its Subsidiaries included in the most recent Universal Report filed prior to the date of this Agreement that includes such a balance sheet, including all notes thereto, as of the date of such balance sheet, neither Universal nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be reflected on, or reserved against in, a consolidated balance sheet of Universal or in the notes thereto prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied, other than liabilities or obligations which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Universal Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) Since September 30, 2003, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Universal have made all certifications (without qualification or exceptions to the matters certified) required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the statements contained in any such certifications are complete and correct; neither Universal nor its officers have received notice from any governmental authority questioning or challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission of such certification. Universal maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that all material information concerning Universal and its Subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for preparing the 

    ##### 

  

    

Universal Reports and other public disclosure and Universal is otherwise in
substantial compliance with all applicable effective provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing standards of the New York Stock
Exchange. As of the date hereof, Universal has no knowledge of any material
weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal controls over financial
reporting. There is no reason to believe that UniversalÂ’s auditors and its
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will not be able to give
the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in
connection with the filing of UniversalÂ’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. 

   

 (c) Universal and its Subsidiaries maintain accurate books and records reflecting in all material respects their respective assets and liabilities and maintain proper and adequate internal accounting controls. 

   

 (d) Neither Universal nor its Subsidiaries has, since July 30, 2002, extended or maintained credit, arranged for the extension of credit, or renewed an extension of credit, in the form of a personal loan to or for any director or executive officer (or equivalent thereof) of Universal. No loan or extension of credit is maintained by Universal or its Subsidiaries to which the second sentence of Section 13(k)(1) of the Exchange Act applies. 

   

 Section 6.8 _Litigation_. Except as described in the Universal Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending against Universal or any of its Subsidiaries or, to UniversalÂ’s knowledge, threatened against Universal or any of its Subsidiaries, at law or in equity or in any arbitration or similar proceedings, before or by any U.S. federal, state or non-U.S. court, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality or any U.S. or non-U.S. arbitral or other dispute resolution body, that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or are reasonably likely to have a Universal Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 Section 6.9 _Absence of Certain Changes_. From January 1, 2006 to the date of this Agreement, there has not been (i) a Universal Material Adverse Effect or (ii) except as described in the Universal Reports filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, (A) any material change by Universal or any of its Subsidiaries in any of its accounting methods, principles or practices or any of its tax methods, practices or elections applicable to UniversalÂ’s consolidated financial statements; (B) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or distribution in respect of any capital stock of Universal or any redemption, purchase or other acquisition of any of its equity securities; (C) any split, combination or reclassification of any capital stock of Universal or any of its Subsidiaries or any issuance or the authorization of any issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of that capital stock; (D) any damage to or any destruction or loss of physical properties owned or used by Universal or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not covered by insurance, that individually or in the aggregate constitutes a Universal Material Adverse Effect; or (E) any reevaluations by Universal or any of its Subsidiaries of any of their assets which, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, Universal will reflect in its consolidated financial statements, including any impairment of assets, and which in the aggregate are material to them. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 6.10 _Taxes_. 

  

 (a) All Returns required to be filed by or with respect to Universal or any of its Subsidiaries (including any Return required to be filed by an affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group that included Universal or any of its Subsidiaries) have been properly filed on a timely basis with the appropriate governmental authorities, except to the extent that any failure to file, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a Universal Material Adverse Effect, and all taxes that have become due (regardless of whether reflected on any Return) have been duly paid or deposited in full on a timely basis or adequately reserved for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, except to the extent that any failure to pay or deposit or make adequate provision for the payment of such taxes, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a Universal Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) Except to the extent such matters, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Universal Material Adverse Effect, (i) no audit or other administrative proceeding or court proceeding is presently pending with regard to any tax or Return of Universal or any of its Subsidiaries as to which any taxing authority has asserted in writing any claim; (ii) no governmental authority is now asserting in writing any deficiency or claim for taxes or any adjustment to taxes with respect to which Universal or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable; and (iii) neither Universal nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for any tax under Treas.

As of the date of this Agreement, neither Universal nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any material request, agreement, consent or waiver to extend any period of limitations applicable to the assessment of any tax upon Universal or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Universal nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any closing agreement described in Section 7121 of the Code or any predecessor provision thereof or any similar agreement under any tax law. Neither Universal nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, is bound by or has any obligation under any tax sharing, allocation or indemnity agreement or any similar agreement or arrangement other than with respect to any such agreement or arrangement among Universal and any of its Subsidiaries. Since December 31, 2005, Universal has not made or rescinded any material election relating to taxes or settled or compromised any claim, action, suit, litigation, proceeding, arbitration, investigation, audit or controversy relating to any material taxes, or except as may be required by Applicable Law, made any material change to any of its methods of reporting income or deductions for federal income tax purposes from those employed in the preparation of its most recently filed federal Returns. Universal has not engaged in any "listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4. To the knowledge of Universal, Universal has not been a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code at any time within the past five years. The Mergers will not cause Universal or any of its Subsidiaries to recognize gain by reason of Section 355(e) of the Code. 

   

 (c) Neither Universal nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of any fact or has taken or failed to take any action that could reasonably be expected to cause gain or loss to be recognized for U.S. federal income tax purposes by a holder of Universal Common Stock upon its transfer that is deemed to occur for U.S. federal income tax purposes of Universal Common 

      ##### 

  

    

Stock to Holdco in exchange for Holdco Common Stock pursuant to the Universal
Merger except for gain that is recognized for U.S. federal income tax

 (d) No Universal Benefit Plan provides medical, surgical, hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether or not insured) for employees or former employees of Universal or any Subsidiary of Universal for periods extending beyond their retirement or other termination of service other than (i) coverage mandated by Applicable Laws, (ii) death benefits under any "pension plan" or (iii) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the current or former employee (or his beneficiary).

 (b) Except for such matters as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Universal Material Adverse Effect, no judicial or administrative proceedings or governmental investigations are pending or, to the knowledge of Universal, threatened against Universal or its Subsidiaries that allege the violation of or seek to impose liability pursuant to any Environmental Law, and there are no past or present facts, conditions or circumstances at, on or arising out of, or otherwise associated with, any current (or, to the knowledge of Universal or its Subsidiaries, former) businesses, assets or properties of Universal or any Subsidiary of Universal, including but not limited to on-site or off-site disposal, release or spill of any Hazardous Materials which violate Environmental Law or are reasonably likely to give rise to (i) costs, expenses, liabilities or obligations for any cleanup, remediation, disposal or corrective action under any Environmental Law, (ii) claims arising for personal injury, property damage or damage to natural resources, or (iii) fines, penalties or injunctive relief. 

    #####

 Section 6.14 _Intellectual Property_. Universal and its Subsidiaries own or possess adequate licenses or other valid rights to use all patents, patent rights, know-how, trade secrets, trademarks, trademark rights and other proprietary information and other proprietary intellectual property rights used or held for use in connection with their respective businesses as currently being conducted, except where the failure to own or possess such licenses and other rights, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a Universal Material Adverse Effect, and there are no assertions or claims challenging the validity of any of the foregoing that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Universal Material Adverse Effect. The conduct of UniversalÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’ respective businesses as currently conducted does not conflict with any patents, patent rights, licenses, trademarks, trademark rights, trade names, trade name rights or copyrights of others, except for such conflicts that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Universal Material Adverse Effect. There is no material infringement of any proprietary right owned by or licensed by or to Universal or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Universal Material Adverse Effect.

 (a) Except for such matters as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Universal Material Adverse Effect, Universal and its Subsidiaries maintain insurance coverage with financially responsible insurance companies in such amounts and against such losses as are customary in the industries in which Universal and its Subsidiaries operate on the date of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Except for such matters as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Universal Material Adverse Effect, no event relating specifically to Universal or its Subsidiaries has occurred that could reasonably be expected, after the date of this Agreement, to result in an upward adjustment in premiums under any insurance policies they maintain. Excluding insurance policies that have expired and been replaced in the 

     ##### 

  

    

ordinary course of business, no excess liability or protection and indemnity
insurance policy has been canceled by the insurer within one year prior to
the date of this Agreement, and no threat in writing has been made to cancel
(excluding cancellation upon expiration or failure to renew) any such
insurance policy of Universal or any Subsidiary of Universal during the period
of one year prior to the date of this Agreement. Prior to the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred, including the failure by Universal or any
Subsidiary of Universal to give any notice or information or by giving any
inaccurate or erroneous notice or information, which materially limits or
impairs the rights of Universal or any Subsidiary of Universal under any such
excess liability or protection and indemnity insurance policies. 

   

 Section 6.17 _No Brokers_. Universal has not entered into any contract, arrangement or understanding with any person or firm which may result in the obligation of Holdco, Hanover or Universal to pay any finderÂ’s fees, brokerage or other like payments in connection with the negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except that Universal has retained Goldman, Sachs and Co. as its financial advisor, the fees of which shall not exceed those set forth in Section 6.17 of the Universal Disclosure Letter. 

  

 Section 6.18 _Opinion of Financial Advisor and Board Approvals_. The Board of Directors of Universal has received the opinion of Goldman, Sachs and Co. to the effect that, subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations relating to such opinion, the Universal Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Universal Common Stock, it being agreed that none of Holdco, Hanover or Hanover Merger Sub has any rights with respect to such opinion. UniversalÂ’s Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests of the stockholders of Universal, (ii) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) recommended adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of Universal. 

  

 Section 6.19 _Hanover Stock Ownership_. Neither Universal nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of capital stock of Hanover or any other securities convertible into or otherwise exercisable to acquire shares of capital stock of Hanover. Universal is not an "interested stockholder" with respect to Hanover and Universal has not, within the last three years, been an "interested stockholder" with respect to Hanover. 

  

 Section 6.20 _Vote Required_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.19, the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Universal capital stock necessary to approve any transaction contemplated by this Agreement is the affirmative vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Universal Common Stock (the "Universal Stockholder Approval"). 

  

 Section 6.21 _Certain Contracts_. 

  

 (a) Except for this Agreement and except as filed as an exhibit to the Universal Reports, neither Universal nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any "material contract" (as such term is defined in item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) 

      ##### 

  

    

(all contracts of the type described in this Section 6.21(a) being referred
to herein as the "Universal Material Contracts"). 

   

 (b) As of the date of this Agreement, each Universal Material Contract is in full force and effect, and Universal and each of its Subsidiaries have in all material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by them to date under each Universal Material Contract to which they are party, except where such failure to be in full force and effect or such failure to perform, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a Universal Material Adverse Effect. Except for such matters as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Universal Material Adverse Effect, neither Universal nor any of its Subsidiaries (x) knows of, or has received written notice of, any breach of or violation or default under (nor, to the knowledge of Universal, does there exist any condition which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would result in such a violation or default under) any Universal Material Contract or (y) has received written notice of the desire of the other party or parties to any such Universal Material Contract to exercise any rights such party has to cancel, terminate or repudiate such contract or exercise remedies thereunder. Each Universal Material Contract is enforceable by Universal or a Subsidiary of Universal in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditorsÂ’ rights and general principles of equity, except where such unenforceability does not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Universal Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 Section 6.22 _Capital Expenditure Program_. As of the date of this Agreement, Section 6.22 of the Universal Disclosure Letter accurately sets forth in all material respects the capital expenditures that are forecast to be incurred in 2007 on a quarterly basis. 

  

 Section 6.23 _Improper Payments_. No material bribes, kickbacks or other payments have been made in violation of Applicable Laws by Universal or any Subsidiary of Universal or agent of any of them in connection with the conduct of their respective businesses or the operation of their respective assets, and neither Universal, any Subsidiary of Universal, nor any agent of any of them has received any such payments from vendors, suppliers or other persons. 

  

 Section 6.24 _Takeover Statutes; Rights Plans_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations of Hanover in Section 5.19 hereof, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not cause to be applicable to the Universal Merger any Takeover Statute. Each of Universal, Holdco and the Merger Subs does not have any preferred share purchase rights plan or similar rights plan in effect. 

  

 Section 6.25 _Title, Ownership and Related Matters._  

  

 (a) Universal and its Subsidiaries have, free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens and Liens, if any, created or permitted to be imposed by Hanover, defensible title to their respective inventory, equipment and other tangible and intangible property, including the natural gas compression and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment owned and/or operated by Universal or its Subsidiaries and related spare parts as may 

     ##### 

  

    

be reduced by the consumption thereof, or increased through the replacement
thereof or addition thereto, in the ordinary course of maintenance and
operation of their respective businesses, in each case as necessary to
permit Universal and its Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses
as currently conducted. 

   

 (b) Each of Universal and its Subsidiaries has complied in all material respects with the terms of all material leases to which it is a party and under which it is in occupancy, and all leases to which Universal or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or under which it is in occupancy are in full force and effect. Each of Universal and its Subsidiaries enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession of the properties or assets purported to be leased under its material leases.

Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be a breach of this Section 7.2 by Hanover. Hanover shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect to any Hanover 

    ##### 

  

    

Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
at any time prior to obtaining Hanover Stockholder Approval, in response to a
bona fide written Hanover Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of
Hanover determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and
a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Hanover Superior Proposal, and which Hanover
Takeover Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement and did not
otherwise result from a breach of this Section 7.2, Hanover may, if its
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of Hanover under Applicable Laws, and subject to
compliance with Section 7.2(c) and after giving Universal written notice of
such determination, (x) furnish information with respect to Hanover and its
Subsidiaries to the person making such Hanover Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less
restrictive of such person than the Confidentiality Agreement, provided that
all such information has previously been provided to Universal or is provided
to Universal prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is
provided to such person, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the person making such Hanover Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Hanover Takeover Proposal. 

    

 The term "Hanover Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of transactions, of assets or businesses that constitute 20% or more of the revenues, net income or the assets of Hanover and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more of any class of equity securities of Hanover or any of its "significant subsidiaries" (as that term is defined in Item 1.02(w) of Regulation S-X), any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of Hanover or any of its significant subsidiaries, or any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar transaction involving Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or the stockholders of any person would own 20% or more of any class of equity securities of Hanover or any of its significant subsidiaries or of any resulting parent company of Hanover, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 The term "Hanover Superior Proposal" means any bona fide proposal or offer made by a third party that if consummated would result in such personÂ’s (or its stockholdersÂ’) owning, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the shares of Hanover Common Stock then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially all the assets of Hanover, which the Board of Directors of Hanover determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be (i) more favorable to the stockholders of Hanover from a financial point of view than the Hanover Merger (taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Universal in response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably capable of being 

   ##### 

  

   

financed and completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory,
timing and other aspects of such proposal. 

   

 For purposes of the definitions of "Hanover Takeover Proposal" and "Hanover Superior Proposal," the term "person" shall include any group within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act. 

  

 (b) Neither the Board of Directors of Hanover nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Universal), or propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Universal), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Hanover Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose to recommend, adopt or approve, any Hanover Takeover Proposal or (C) fail to reaffirm within a reasonable period of time upon request by Universal (publicly if so requested) its recommendation of this Agreement, the Hanover Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any such action or failure described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Hanover Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or allow Hanover or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Hanover Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 7.2(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining Hanover Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of Hanover may make a Hanover Adverse Recommendation Change if such Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Hanover under Applicable Laws;  _provided, however,_ that no Hanover Adverse Recommendation Change may be made until after the fifth business day following UniversalÂ’s receipt of written notice (a "Hanover Notice of Adverse Recommendation") from Hanover advising Universal that the Board of Directors of Hanover intends to make a Hanover Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying the terms and conditions of the Hanover Superior Proposal, if any, that is related to such Hanover Adverse Recommendation Change (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Hanover Superior Proposal shall require a new Hanover Notice of Adverse Recommendation and a new five business day period). In determining whether to make a Hanover Adverse Recommendation Change, the Board of Directors of Hanover shall take into account any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Universal in response to a Hanover Notice of Adverse Recommendation or otherwise. 

   

 (c) In addition to the obligations of Hanover set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 7.2, Hanover shall promptly (and in any event within one business day after receipt thereof) advise Universal orally and in writing of any Hanover Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Hanover Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Hanover Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making any such Hanover Takeover Proposal or inquiry. Hanover shall (i) keep Universal fully informed of the status and 

    ##### 

  

    

material terms and conditions (including any change therein) of any such
Hanover Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to Universal as soon as
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of
all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to Hanover or
any of its Subsidiaries from any person that describes any of the material
terms and conditions of any Hanover Takeover Proposal. 

   

 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 7.2 shall prohibit Hanover from (x) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (y) making any required disclosure to the stockholders of Hanover if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Hanover (after consultation with outside counsel) failure to so disclose would constitute a violation of Applicable Law or fiduciary duty;  _provided, however,_ that in no event shall Hanover or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 7.2(b). 

    

 Section 7.3 _No Solicitation by Universal_. 

  

 (a) Universal shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers or employees or any Representative retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action designed to, or which could reasonably be expected to, facilitate, any inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Universal Takeover Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any confidential information in connection with, any Universal Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of Universal or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of Universal or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be a breach of this Section 7.3 by Universal. Universal shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect to any Universal Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining Universal Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Universal Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of Universal determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Universal Superior Proposal, and which Universal Takeover Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 7.3, Universal may, if its Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Universal under Applicable Laws, and subject to compliance with Section 7.3(c) and after giving Hanover written notice of such determination, (x) furnish information with respect to Universal and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Universal Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such person than the Confidentiality Agreement, provided that all such information has previously been provided to Hanover or is provided to Hanover prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such person, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the 

     ##### 

 

  

person making such Universal Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives)
regarding such Universal Takeover Proposal. 

    

 The term "Universal Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of transactions, of assets or businesses that constitute 20% or more of the revenues, net income or the assets of Universal and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more of any class of equity securities of Universal or any of its "significant subsidiaries" (as that term is defined in Item 1.02(w) of Regulation S-X), any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of Universal or any of its Subsidiaries, or any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar transaction involving Universal or any of its significant subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or the stockholders of any person would own 20% or more of any class of equity securities of Universal or any of its significant subsidiaries or of any resulting parent company of Universal, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 The term "Universal Superior Proposal" means any bona fide proposal or offer made by a third party that if consummated would result in such personÂ’s (or its stockholdersÂ’) owning, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the shares of Universal Common Stock then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially all the assets of Universal, which the Board of Directors of Universal determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be (i) more favorable to the stockholders of Universal from a financial point of view than the Universal Merger (taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Hanover in response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably capable of being financed and completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory, timing and other aspects of such proposal. 

   

 For purposes of the definitions of "Universal Takeover Proposal" and "Universal Superior Proposal," the term "person" shall include any group within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act. 

  

 (b) Neither the Board of Directors of Universal nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Hanover), or propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Hanover), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Universal Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose to recommend, adopt or approve, any Universal Takeover Proposal or (C) fail to reaffirm within a reasonable period of time upon request by Hanover (publicly if so requested) its recommendation of this Agreement, the Universal Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any such action or failure described in this clause 

     ##### 

  

    

(i) being referred to as a "Universal Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or allow Universal
or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Universal
Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 7.3(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining Universal Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of Universal
may make a Universal Adverse Recommendation Change if such Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of Universal under Applicable Laws; _provided, however,_ that no
Universal Adverse Recommendation Change may be made until after the fifth
business day following HanoverÂ’s receipt of written notice (a
"Universal Notice of Adverse Recommendation") from Universal advising Hanover
that the Board of Directors of Universal intends to make a Universal Adverse
Recommendation Change and specifying the terms and conditions of the
Universal Superior Proposal, if any, that is related to such Universal
Adverse Recommendation Change (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Universal
Superior Proposal shall require a new Universal Notice of Adverse
Recommendation and a new five business day period). In determining whether to
make a Universal Adverse Recommendation Change, the Board of Directors of
Universal shall take into account any changes to the financial terms of this
Agreement proposed by Hanover in response to a Universal Notice of Adverse
Recommendation or otherwise. 

   

 (c) In addition to the obligations of Universal set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 7.3, Universal shall promptly (and in any event within one business day after receipt thereof) advise Hanover orally and in writing of any Universal Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Universal Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Universal Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making any such Universal Takeover Proposal or inquiry. Universal shall (i) keep Hanover fully informed of the status and material terms and conditions (including any change therein) of any such Universal Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to Hanover as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to Universal or any of its Subsidiaries from any person that describes any of the material terms and conditions of any Universal Takeover Proposal. 

   

 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 7.3 shall prohibit Universal from (x) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (y) making any required disclosure to the stockholders of Universal if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Universal (after consultation with outside counsel) failure to so disclose would constitute a violation of Applicable Law or fiduciary duty;  _provided, however,_ that in no event shall Universal or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 7.3(b).

 Section 7.4 _Meetings of Stockholders_. 

  

 (a) Each of Universal and Hanover shall take all action necessary, in accordance with Applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, to convene a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 has been declared effective to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement. Such meeting may be held in conjunction with the annual meeting of stockholders of Universal and/or Hanover, in which case such meeting may also be held to elect directors and ratify the selection of independent registered public accountants of Universal or Hanover, as the case may be, as well as such other matters as may be considered by the stockholders of Universal or Hanover in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Universal or Hanover, as the case may be, as long as no matter presented to such stockholders for consideration is inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement. Universal and Hanover shall coordinate and cooperate with respect to the timing of such meetings and shall use their reasonable best efforts to hold such meetings on the same day. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms hereof, Hanover and Universal shall each submit the foregoing matters to its stockholders, whether or not the Board of Directors of Hanover or Universal, as the case may be, withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation and declaration regarding such matters. 

   

 (b) Subject to Sections 7.2 and 7.3, respectively, each of Universal and Hanover, through its Board of Directors, shall recommend approval of such matters and use its reasonable best efforts to take all lawful action to solicit approval by its stockholders in favor of such matters. 

   

 (c) Universal, in its capacity as sole stockholder of Holdco, shall take all action necessary to approve the Holdco Charter.

jurisdictions in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the Mergers and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (B) timely making all such filings and
timely seeking all such consents, approvals, permits or
authorizations without causing a Universal Material Adverse Effect or a
Hanover Material Adverse Effect; 

   

 (iii) promptly notify each other of any communication concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to that party from any governmental or regulatory authority and permit the other party to review in advance any proposed communication concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any governmental or regulatory authority; 

   

 (iv) not participate or agree to participate in any meeting or discussion with any governmental or regulatory authority in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such governmental or regulatory authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or discussion; 

   

 (v) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its affiliates and representatives on the one hand, and any government or regulatory authority or members of any such authorityÂ’s staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; 

   

 (vi) furnish the other party with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party and its affiliates may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of necessary filings, registrations or submissions of information to any governmental or regulatory authorities, including any filings necessary or appropriate under the provisions of the HSR Act and any applicable Non-U.S. Antitrust Laws; 

   

 (vii) "substantially comply" and certify substantial compliance with any request for additional information (also known as a "second request") issued pursuant to the HSR Act as soon as reasonably practicable following the issuance of the request for additional information; and

   ##### 

  

   

and filings, and to obtain the relief and commitments contemplated by
Sections 8.1(f), (g), (h) and (i). 

  

 (b) Without limiting Section 7.5(a), but subject to Section 7.5(c), Universal and Hanover shall each use reasonable best efforts: 

    

 (i) to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and to obtain required clearances and approvals under any applicable Non-U.S. Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable; 

   

 (ii) to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, terminated or modified, any decree, order or judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing; and 

   

 (iii) to take any and all steps necessary to obtain any consents or eliminate any impediments to the Mergers. 

  

 (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall require Universal or Hanover to dispose of any of its assets or to limit its freedom of action with respect to any of its businesses, or to consent to any disposition of its assets or limits on its freedom of action with respect to any of its businesses, whether prior to or after the Effective Time, or to commit or agree to any of the foregoing, to obtain any consents, approvals, permits or authorizations or to remove any impediments to the Mergers relating to Antitrust Laws or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding relating to the HSR Act, Non-U.S. Antitrust Laws or other antitrust, competition, premerger notification or trade-regulation law, regulation or order ("Antitrust Laws"), other than such dispositions, limitations or consents, commitments or agreements that in each such case may be conditioned upon the consummation of the Mergers and the transactions contemplated hereby and that in each such case, individually or in the aggregate, do not have and are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Holdco after the Mergers; provided, however, that neither Hanover nor Universal shall take or agree to any action required or permitted by this Section 7.5(c) without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   

 (d) Neither Universal, Hanover nor their respective Subsidiaries shall take actions, cause actions to be taken or fail to take actions, as a result of which (i) gain or loss would be recognized for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the transfer that is deemed to occur for U.S. federal income tax purposes of Hanover Common Stock to Holdco in exchange for Holdco Common Stock pursuant to the Hanover Merger except for gain that is recognized for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the receipt of cash in lieu of a fractional share of Holdco Common Stock or (ii) gain or loss would be recognized for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the transfer that is deemed to occur for U.S. federal income tax purposes of Universal Common Stock to Holdco in exchange for Holdco Common Stock pursuant to the Universal Merger except for gain that is recognized for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the receipt of cash in lieu of a fractional share of Holdco Common Stock.

 Section 10.12 _Severability_.

 Section 1.2 _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the stockholders, other than those required by statute, may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or the President or by the Board of Directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board.

Notice of the place, if any, date, and time of all meetings of the stockholders, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose for which the meeting is called, shall be given, not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date on which the meeting is to be held, to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting, except as otherwise provided herein or required by law (meaning, here and hereinafter, as required from time to time by the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _GCL_ ") or the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation). 

  

 When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; _provided, however_ , that if the date of any adjourned meeting is more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the meeting was originally noticed, or if a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the place, if any, date, and time of the adjourned meeting and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting, shall be given in conformity herewith. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting.

the extent that the presence of a larger number may be required by law. Where
a separate vote by a class or classes or series is required, a majority of
the voting power of the shares of such class or classes or series present in
person or represented by proxy shall constitute a quorum entitled to take

 If a quorum shall fail to attend any meeting, the chairman of the meeting may adjourn the meeting to another place, if any, date, or time. 

  

 Section 1.5 _Organization_. Such person as the Board of Directors may have designated or, in the absence of such person, the Chairman of the Board or, in his or her absence, the President of the Corporation or, in his or her absence, such person as may be chosen by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, shall call to order any meeting of the stockholders and act as chairman of the meeting. In the absence of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the chairman of the meeting appoints. 

  

 Section 1.6 _Conduct of Business_. The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seem to him or her in order. The chairman shall have the power to adjourn the meeting to another place, if any, date and time. The date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at the meeting shall be announced at the meeting. 

  

 Section 1.7 _Proxies and Voting_. At any meeting of the stockholders, every stockholder entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy authorized by an instrument in writing or by a transmission permitted by law filed in accordance with the procedure established for the meeting. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this paragraph may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission. 

  

 The Corporation may, and to the extent required by law, shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting may, and to the extent required by law, shall, appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. Every vote taken by ballots shall be counted by a duly appointed inspector or inspectors. 

  

 All elections shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast, and except as otherwise required by law or these Bylaws, all other matters shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively. 

   #####

 The stock list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting as provided by law. This list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them. 

  

 Section 1.9 _Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations_. 

  

 (A) _Annual Meetings of Stockholders_.

To be timely, a stockholderÂ’s notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than forty-five (45) or more than seventy-five (75) days prior to the first anniversary (the " _Anniversary_ ") of the date on which the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the preceding yearÂ’s annual meeting of stockholders; _provided, however_ , that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than thirty (30) days prior to or delayed by more than thirty (30) days after the anniversary of the preceding yearÂ’s annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not later than the close of 

   ##### 

  

    

business on the later of (i) the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or
(ii) the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date
of such meeting is first made. Such stockholderÂ’s notice shall set forth: (a)
as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or
reelection as a Director all information relating to such person that
is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of
Directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_
"), including such personÂ’s written consent to being named in the proxy
statement as a nominee and to serving as a Director if elected; (b) as to any
other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a
brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting,
the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material
interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if
any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the stockholder
giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the
nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder,
as they appear on the CorporationÂ’s books, and of such beneficial owner, (ii)
the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are owned beneficially
and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (iii) a
representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person
or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business and nomination and
(iv) whether either such stockholder or beneficial owner intends to deliver a
proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of, in the case of a proposal,
at least the percentage of the CorporationÂ’s voting shares required under
applicable law to carry the proposal or, in the case of a nomination or
nominations, a sufficient number of holders of the CorporationÂ’s voting shares
to elect such nominee or nominees (an affirmative statement of such intent, a
" _Solicitation Notice_ "). The foregoing notice requirements of this
_Section 1.9(A)(2)_ shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the
stockholder has notified the Corporation of his, her or its intention to
present a proposal or nomination at an annual meeting in compliance with
applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and such
stockholderÂ’s proposal or nomination has been included in a proxy statement
that has been prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such
annual meeting. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish
such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the

ARTICLE VIII 
 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS 

   

 Section 8.1 _Mandatory Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless to the full extent permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware as from time to time in effect any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be 

   ##### 

  

    

made a party to, or is otherwise involved in, any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (whether or not an action by or in the right of the
Corporation) (hereinafter a " _proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he
or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or, while serving
as a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request
of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise (hereinafter an " _indemnitee_ "), or by reason of any action
alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity against all expense,
liability and loss (including attorneysÂ’ fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise
taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or
suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that,
except as provided in Section 8.2 with respect to proceedings to enforce
rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such
indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to indemnification
conferred by this _Section 8.1_ also shall include the right of such persons
described in this _Section 8.1_ to be paid in advance by the Corporation for
their expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees) incurred in defending any such
proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "
_advancement of expenses_ ") to the full extent permitted by the laws of the
State of Delaware, as from time to time in effect; _provided, however_ ,
that, if the GCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an
indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any
other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee) shall
be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter
an " _undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all
amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial
decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "
_final adjudication_ ") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified for such expenses under this _Section 8.1_ or otherwise. The
right to indemnification conferred on such persons by this _Section 8.1_
shall be a contract right. 

  

 Section 8.2 _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a claim under _Section 8.1_ of these Bylaws is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the GCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such 

   ##### 

  

    

directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of
the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met
the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the GCL, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties
to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or
its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the
applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the
indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee
to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses
hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement
of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving
that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement
of expenses, under this _Article VIII_ or otherwise shall be on the
Corporation. 

  

 Section 8.3 _Permissive Indemnification of Non-Officer Employees and Agents_. The Corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (whether or not an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was an employee (other than an officer) or agent of the Corporation, or, while serving as an employee (other than an officer) or agent of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, to the extent (i) permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware as from time to time in effect, and (ii) authorized in the sole discretion of the Chief Executive Officer and at least one other of the following officers: the President, the Chief Financial Officer, or the General Counsel of the Corporation (the Chief Executive Officer and any of such other officers so authorizing such indemnification, the " _Authorizing Officers_ "). The Corporation may, to the extent permitted by Delaware law and authorized in the sole discretion of the Authorizing Officers, pay expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees) reasonably incurred by any such employee or agent in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, upon such terms and conditions as the Authorizing Officers authorizing such expense advancement determine in their sole discretion. The provisions of this _Section 8.3_ shall not constitute a contract right for any such employee or agent. 

  

 Section 8.4 _General Provisions_. The rights and authority conferred in any of the Sections of this _Article VIII_ shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. Neither the amendment or repeal of this _Article VIII_ or any of the Sections thereof nor the adoption of any provision of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws or of any statute inconsistent with this  _Article VIII_ or any of the Sections thereof shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this  _Article VIII_ or any of the Sections thereof in respect of any acts or omissions occurring prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption or an inconsistent provision.

Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, including Rule 145 under the Act,
and will hold all the Shares subject to all applicable provisions of the Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder. 

   

 B. The undersigned has been advised that the offering, sale and delivery of the Shares to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger Agreement will be registered under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. The undersigned has also been advised and agrees, however, that, since the undersigned may be deemed an underwriter of the Shares, the undersigned may not offer, sell, pledge, hypothecate, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares except (i) in a transaction in compliance with Rule 145 under the Act and upon the delivery to Holdco of written evidence of such compliance in a form reasonably satisfactory to Holdco, (ii) pursuant to an effective registration statement registering such transaction under the Act or (iii) in a transaction that, in the written opinion of counsel, which opinion shall be reasonably acceptable in form and substance to Holdco and delivered to Holdco, is not required to be registered under the Act. 

   

 C. The undersigned understands and agrees that neither Holdco nor any of its current or future affiliates is under any obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of any Shares by the undersigned or on the undersignedÂ’s behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available. 

  

 In the event of a sale, pledge, hypothecation, transfer or other disposition by the undersigned of any of the Shares pursuant to Rule 145 under the Act, the undersigned will supply Holdco with evidence of compliance with such rule in the form of a brokerÂ’s letter in customary form or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Holdco. 

  

 The undersigned also agrees that stop transfer instructions may be given to HoldcoÂ’s transfer agent with respect to the Shares and that there may be placed on any certificates representing such Shares or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance as follows: 

   

"THIS CERTIFICATE AND THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE BEEN ISSUED PURSUANT
TO A TRANSACTION GOVERNED BY RULE 145 ("RULE 145") PROMULGATED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"), AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED,
HYPOTHECATED, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF UNLESS (I) IN COMPLIANCE
WITH RULE 145 AND UPON THE DELIVERY TO ILIAD HOLDINGS, INC. ("HOLDCO") OF
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF SUCH COMPLIANCE IN A FORM REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE
TO HOLDCO, (II) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT REGISTERING
SUCH TRANSACTION UNDER THE ACT OR (III) IN A TRANSACTION THAT, IN THE WRITTEN
OPINION OF COUNSEL, WHICH OPINION SHALL BE REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE IN FORM AND
SUBSTANCE TO HOLDCO AND DELIVERED TO HOLDCO, IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE REGISTERED
UNDER THE ACT." 

   ##### 

  

  

 It is understood and agreed that such stop transfer instructions and the legend set forth above shall be removed upon surrender of certificates bearing such legend by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend (i) if the undersigned shall have delivered to Holdco (A) in the case of a sale, pledge, hypothecation, transfer or other disposition in compliance with Rule 145 under the Act, written evidence of such compliance in a form reasonably acceptable to Holdco or (B) an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Holdco to the effect that the sale, pledge, hypothecation, transfer or other disposition of the Shares represented by the surrendered certificates may be effected without the registration thereof under the Act and (ii) upon any sale, pledge, hypothecation, transfer or other disposition registered under the Act pursuant to a registration statement in effect at the time of such sale, pledge, hypothecation, transfer or other disposition. 

  

 The undersigned acknowledges that (i) the undersigned has carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed the requirements of such documents and other applicable limitations upon the undersignedÂ’s ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Shares, to the extent the undersigned felt necessary, with the undersignedÂ’s counsel and (ii) the receipt by [Hector/Ulysses] of this letter is a condition to [HectorÂ’s/UlyssesÂ’] obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 

  

 Execution of this letter shall not be considered an admission on the part of the undersigned that the undersigned is an underwriter of the Shares for purposes of Rule 145 under the Act or as a waiver of any rights the undersigned may have to any claim that the undersigned is not such an underwriter on or after the date of this letter. 

 

Very truly yours,
