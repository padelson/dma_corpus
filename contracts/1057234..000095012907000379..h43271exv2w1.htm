Hanover is duly qualified to do business and, to the extent such concept or a similar concept
exists in the relevant jurisdiction, is in good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in
which the character of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in

concept or a similar concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction, is in good standing under the
laws of any jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it therein or
in which the transaction of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to

Effect. Each of Universal, Holdco and each Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted.
The copies of the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of Universal, Holdco and each Merger Sub

of the Universal Stockholder Approval, (ii)&nbsp;the adoption of this Agreement by Holdco in its

Sections&nbsp;13(a), 14(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and have made available to Hanover each
registration statement, report, proxy statement or information statement (other than preliminary
materials) they have so filed, each in the form (including exhibits and any amendments thereto)
filed with the SEC (collectively, the &#147;Universal Reports&#148;). As of its respective date, each
Universal Report (i)&nbsp;complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii)&nbsp;did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except for any statements in any Universal Report that have been modified by an
amendment to such report filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof. Each of the consolidated
balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the Universal Reports (including
related notes and schedules) complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and
fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Universal and its
Subsidiaries (or such entities as indicated in such balance sheet) as of its date, and each of the
consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders&#146; equity included in
or incorporated by reference into the Universal Reports (including any related notes and schedules)
fairly presents in all material respects the results of operations, cash flows or changes in
stockholders&#146; equity, as the case may be, of Universal and its Subsidiaries (or such entities as
indicated in such balance sheet) for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to (x)&nbsp;such exceptions as may be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and (y)
normal, recurring year-end audit adjustments which are not material in the aggregate), in each case
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied during the periods
involved, except as may be noted therein. Except as and to the extent set forth on the
consolidated balance sheet of Universal and its Subsidiaries included in the most recent Universal
Report filed prior to the date of this Agreement that includes such a balance sheet, including all
notes thereto, as of the date of such balance sheet, neither Universal nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) that would be required to be reflected on, or reserved against in, a consolidated
balance sheet of Universal or in the notes thereto prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied, other than liabilities or obligations which,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Universal

disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, upon such terms and conditions as the Authorizing
