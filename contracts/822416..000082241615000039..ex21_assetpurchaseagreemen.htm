adjustments shall be made to the Base Book Value Amount.

(i) The Final Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties hereto
at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the 30th day following the date on which the
Final Statement was delivered to the Companies, unless the Companies deliver
written notice of their disagreement with the Final Statement (a "Notice of
Disagreement") to the Buyer prior to such time.

(i) Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature
of any disagreement so asserted. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by
the Buyer in a timely manner, then the Final Statement (as revised in
accordance with this sentence) shall become final and binding upon the parties
on the earlier of (A) the date the Companies and the Buyer resolve in writing
any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice
of Disagreement and (B) the date any disputed matters are finally resolved in
writing by the Accounting Firm.

(ii) During the 14-day period following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, the Companies and the Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve
in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of 

Disagreement. If at the end of such 14-day period the Companies and the Buyer
have not resolved in writing the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement, then, no later than ten (10) days following such 14-day period,
the Companies and the Buyer shall submit to the Accounting Firm, acting as
experts, for resolution, in accordance with the standards set forth in this
Section 3.2, only matters that remain in dispute. The parties shall use
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a written decision
resolving the matters submitted to the Accounting Firm within thirty (30) days
of the receipt of such submission.

(iii) The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be
limited to fixing mathematical errors and determining whether the items in
dispute were determined in accordance with the Book Value Notes, and the
Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination, including any
determination as to whether the Base Book Value Amount or the Book Value
Estimate amounts are correct.

(iv) The Accounting Firm's decision shall be based solely on written
submissions by the Companies and the Buyer and their respective
representatives (and it shall not permit or authorize discovery or hear
testimony) and not by independent review and shall be final and binding on all
of the parties hereto. The Accounting Firm may not assign a value greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or smaller than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either party. Judgment may be entered
upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction
over the party against which such determination is to be enforced. The fees,
costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to this Section
3.2, shall be allocated between the Companies, on the one hand, and the Buyer,
on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of the disputes
not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such
party. For example, if the Companies claim that the appropriate adjustments
are $1,000 greater than the amount determined by the Buyer and if the
Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding to the Companies
$300 of the $1,000 contested, then the fees, costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm will be allocated 30% (i.e., 300 ÷ 1,000) to the Buyer and 70%
(i.e., 700 ÷ 1,000) to the Companies.

(j) Upon the determination of the Final Book Value pursuant to Section 3.2(b)
(the date of such determination, the "Determination Date"), the Estimated
Purchase Price shall be recalculated utilizing the Final Book Value Increase
or Final Book Value Decrease in lieu of the Book Value Increase or Book Value
Decrease (the Estimated Purchase Price as so recalculated, the "Final Purchase
Price").

(i) If the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price (such
excess, the "Company Adjustment Amount"), then, promptly (but in any event
within five (5) Business Days following the Determination Date), the Buyer
shall deliver to the Companies the Company Adjustment Amount by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Companies (such designation to be made at least two (2) Business Days prior to
the expiration of such five-Business Day period).

(ii) If the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price (such
excess, the "Buyer Adjustment Amount"), then, promptly (but in any event
within five (5) Business Days following the Determination Date), the Companies
shall deliver to the Buyer the Buyer Adjustment Amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds 

to an account designated in writing by the Buyer (such designation to be made
at least two (2) Business Days prior to the expiration of such five-Business
Day period).

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the
parties hereto may make or assert any claim under this Section 3.2 from and
after (x) the payment of the applicable amounts provided in this Section
3.2(c) or (y) in the case that the Final Purchase Price is equal to the
Estimated Purchase Price, the determination of the Final Book Value pursuant
to Section 3.2(b).

(k) No actions taken by the Buyer on or following the Closing Date shall be
given effect for purposes of determining the Closing Book Value. During the
period of time from and after the Closing Date through the final determination
and payment of Closing Book Value in accordance with this Section 3.2, the
Buyer shall afford to the Companies and any accountants, counsel or financial
advisers retained by the Companies in connection with the review of Closing
Book Value in accordance with this Section 3.2, direct access during normal
business hours upon reasonable advance notice to all the properties, books,
contracts, personnel, representatives (including the Buyer's accountants) and
records of the Buyer and such representatives (including the work papers of
the Buyer's accountants, subject to entry into customary agreements with the
Buyer's accountants with respect thereto) reasonably necessary for the review
of the Final Statement and the Buyer's determination of Closing Book Value in
accordance with this Section 3.2. Buyer shall also provide electronic copies
of all such records, as well as explanations of any differences between any
numbers included in the Companies' estimate of the Closing Book Value
delivered pursuant to Section 3.1(c) and the Final Statement delivered by the
Buyer pursuant to Section 3.2(a).

3.3 Company Reserve. In order to satisfy the Companies' obligations, if any,
under Section 3.2, the Companies acknowledge and agree that the Companies
shall place in a segregated account or otherwise reserve a portion of the
Estimated Purchase Price received at the Closing sufficient to fully satisfy
the obligation to deliver amounts to the Buyer pursuant to Section 3.2(c), if
any (such amount, the "Reserve Amount") until such time as the Final Purchase
Price is determined in accordance with Section 3.2 (the "Reserve Release
Date"). On the Reserve Release Date, the Companies shall be entitled to
release from such segregated account or reserve the Reserve Amount less the
Buyer Adjustment Amount, if any, which is to be paid by the Companies in
accordance with Section 3.2(c)(ii).

3.4 Escrow Account.

(j) At the Closing, the Buyer shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with the Escrow Agent into a segregated account (the "Indemnity Escrow
Account") cash in the amount of $15,000,000 (the "Indemnity Escrow Amount"),
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in
writing by the Escrow Agent no fewer than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date. The Indemnity Escrow Account shall be used exclusively to
satisfy any claims of a Buyer Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to
ARTICLE 11.

(k) On the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "First Release
Date"), the Buyer and the Companies shall cause the Escrow Agent to distribute
from the Indemnity Escrow Account to the Companies the following amount (the
"First Release Date Reserved Amount"): (i) $5,000,000 minus (ii) any and all
amounts paid to the Buyer from the 

Indemnity Escrow Account prior to the First Release Date minus (iii) the
amount of any unresolved claims for Losses timely asserted by any Buyer
Indemnitee pursuant to any Claims Notice delivered in accordance with Section
11.4 prior to the First Release Date. Following the First Release Date, from
time to time, upon resolution of any Claims Notice in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement in respect of any individual claim for
Losses timely asserted by any Buyer Indemnitee and the payment or delivery of
the appropriate amount, if any, from the Escrow Account to the applicable
Buyer Indemnitee in respect of such Claims Notice, the Buyer and the Companies
shall cause the Escrow Agent to distribute from the Indemnity Escrow Account
to the Companies the portion of any First Release Date Reserved Amount in
respect of such resolved Claims Notice not paid (or otherwise delivered) to
the applicable Buyer Indemnitee.

(l) On the twelve-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Second Release
Date"), the Buyer and the Companies shall cause the Escrow Agent to distribute
from the Indemnity Escrow Account to the Companies the following amount (the
"Second Release Date Reserved Amount"): (i) $5,000,000 minus (ii) any and all
amounts paid to the Buyer from the Indemnity Escrow Account prior to the
Second Release Date and not previously offset against amounts distributed on
the First Release Date minus (iii) the amount of any unresolved claims for
Losses timely asserted by any Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to any Claims Notice
delivered in accordance with Section 11.4 on or after the First Release Date
and prior to the Second Release Date. Following the Second Release Date, from
time to time, upon resolution of any Claims Notice in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement in respect of any individual claim for
Losses timely asserted by any Buyer Indemnitee and the payment or delivery of
the appropriate amount, if any, from the Escrow Account to the applicable
Buyer Indemnitee in respect of such Claims Notice, the Buyer and the Companies
shall cause the Escrow Agent to distribute from the Indemnity Escrow Account
to the Companies the portion of any Second Release Date Reserved Amount in
respect of such resolved Claims Notice not paid (or otherwise delivered) to
the applicable Buyer Indemnitee.

(m) On the eighteen-month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Buyer and the
Companies shall cause the Escrow Agent to distribute from the Indemnity Escrow
Account to the Companies in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement
the amount by which the remaining funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account, if
any, exceed the amount of any unresolved claims for Losses timely asserted by
any Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to any Claims Notice delivered in accordance
with Section 11.4. Thereafter, any funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account held
in respect of any unresolved claims for Losses timely asserted by any Buyer
Indemnitee pursuant to any Claims Notice delivered in accordance with Section
11.4 shall be distributed in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. In the
event of a conflict between the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement, the terms
of this Agreement shall govern. 

3.5 Purchase Price Allocation. As promptly as practicable, and in no event
later than (i) sixty (60) days, after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
deliver to the Companies an estimated schedule and (ii) ninety (90) days,
after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to the Companies a final
schedule (the "Allocation Schedule"), in each case allocating the Purchase
Price (including, for purposes of this Section 3.5, any other consideration
paid to the Companies including the Assumed Liabilities and any
indemnification or other adjustments to the Purchase Price) among the
Purchased Assets, consistent with the allocation set forth on Exhibit C;
provided, however, that the parties hereto agree that an amount not less than
the Minimum Goodwill Allocation Amount shall be allocated to intangible assets
and/or goodwill. The Allocation Schedule shall be reasonable and shall be
determined in good faith by the Buyer after reasonable consultation with the
Companies, and shall be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. The Companies shall have a period of
ten (10) Business Days after the delivery of the Allocation Schedule (the
"Response Period") to present in writing to the Buyer notice of any objections
the Companies may have to the allocations set forth therein (an "Allocation
Objection Notice"). Unless the Companies timely object, such Allocation
Schedule shall be binding on the parties without further adjustment, absent
manifest error. If the Companies shall raise any objections within the
Response Period, the Buyer and the Companies shall negotiate in good faith and
use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such dispute. If the parties fail
to agree within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the Allocation
Objection Notice, then the disputed items shall be resolved by the Accounting
Firm, whose determination shall be final and binding on the parties. The
Accounting Firm shall resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after the
item has been referred to it. The costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be borne equally by the Companies and the Buyer. The Buyer and the
Companies each agree to file Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, and all
federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns, in accordance with the
Allocation Schedule. The Buyer and the Companies each agree to provide the
other promptly with any other information required to complete Form 8594. The
Allocation Schedule shall be amended upon notice by the Buyer of any required
modifications thereto reasonably determined by the Buyer after reasonable
consultation with the Companies to be necessary related to the Indemnity
Escrow Amount or upon the closing of the sale by the Companies or the Company
Subsidiaries of any Delayed Transfer Properties to the Buyer. Any such
amendment shall reflect allocations that are consistent with the principles
set forth above in this Section 3.5, including the allocation set forth on
Exhibit C and, in the case of the Delayed Transfer Properties, the allocation
of the Minimum Goodwill Allocation Amount. 

3.6 Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding Section 7.9, with respect to any Transfer
Taxes, (i) the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries shall be liable for and
shall pay all such Transfer Taxes with respect to Georgia, North Carolina and
South Carolina (the "Company-Apportioned Transfer Taxes") and the Companies
agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer from and against all Company-
Apportioned Transfer Taxes and (ii) the Buyer shall be liable for and shall
pay all such Transfer Taxes with respect to Tennessee (the "Buyer-Apportioned
Transfer Taxes") and Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Companies
and the Company Subsidiaries from and against all Buyer-Apportioned Transfer
Taxes. Each of the Companies and the Buyer agrees to timely sign and deliver
such certificates or forms as may be necessary or appropriate with respect to
the Transfer Taxes.

3.7 Withholding Taxes. The Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to the Companies pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under any applicable provision of federal, state or local Tax law or
under any applicable Legal Requirement. Any amounts deducted or withheld
pursuant to this Section 3.7 will be remitted by the Buyer to the appropriate
Tax Authority. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid by the Buyer to the Companies. The parties acknowledge that, so long as
the Companies deliver the certificate identified in Section 7.12 with respect
to FIRPTA and the affidavits identified in Section 4.2(b)(xi) and Section
4.2(b)(xiii), no withholding with respect to FIRPTA will be required and no
withholding for Taxes is expected under current Tax law.

Schedule 5.18, (A) all Home Sale Contracts are in full force and effect and
are binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to the
Equitable Exceptions, and (B) no buyer under any Home Sale Contract is
entitled to receive any monetary concession or other form of compensation from
the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Companies,
the Specified Entities in connection with its purchase of a residential home
other than as set forth in such buyer's Home Sale Contract. Neither any
Company, any Company Subsidiary nor, to the knowledge of the Companies, any
Specified Entity nor any buyer of a residential home is in default in any
material way under any of the Home Sale Contracts, except to the extent that
such defaults, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be
material to the Business or the Purchased Assets, taken as a whole. The forms
of all Home Sale Contracts and copies of all "build-on-your-lot" Contracts in
effect as of the Closing have been made available to the Buyer.

5.19 Affiliate Transactions. Except as disclosed on Schedule 5.19, neither any
Company, any Company Subsidiary nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any
Specified Entity is a party to any contract or agreement that is currently in
effect with, or involving the making of any payment or transfer of assets to,
any stockholder, officer, member, partner or director of any Company or any
Affiliate of any Company, in each case, that is necessary to enable the Buyer
to conduct the Business as currently conducted by the Companies and the
Company Subsidiaries. No Affiliate of the Companies or any Company Subsidiary
provides any material services to the Companies or any Company Subsidiary with
respect to the Business, and no Affiliate of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary will, immediately after the Closing, have any interest in any
Purchased Asset, except to the extent contemplated in the Transition Services
Agreement.

5.20 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as set forth in Schedule
5.20, since the date of the Audited Balance Sheet to the date of this
Agreement, (a) each Company and each Company Subsidiary have conducted their
respective businesses in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past
practice; and (b) there has been no event, occurrence or development which has
had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.21 Title to Assets; Sufficiency.

(a) A Company or a Company Subsidiary has good and valid title to, or a valid
and binding leasehold, license or similar interest in, all of the Purchased
Assets (other than the Real Property, which shall be governed exclusively by
Sections 5.15 and 5.16), free and clear of all Encumbrances, except for
Permitted Encumbrances and except as set forth in Schedule 5.21(a). Upon
delivery to the Buyer on the Closing Date of the instruments of transfer
contemplated by Section 4.2, the Companies will thereby transfer to the Buyer
good and valid title to, or a valid and binding leasehold, license or similar
interest in, such Purchased Assets, free and clear of any Encumbrances, except
for Permitted Encumbrances.

(b) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.21(b) and except for the Excluded
Assets, the Purchased Assets, together with the rights provided hereunder and
under the Transaction Agreements, constitute all the assets necessary to
conduct the Business as 

currently conducted by the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, and the
tangible Purchased Assets are in sufficient condition (ordinary wear and tear
excepted) to enable the Buyer to conduct the Business as currently conducted
by the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, in each case, in all material
respects.

5.22 Warranties; Product Recalls.

(a) Attached to Schedule 5.22(a) is a list of each form of warranty offered by
the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries under the Home Sale Contracts. No
material liability of any Company or any Company Subsidiary exists for any
return claim, warranty claim or other obligation to provide parts and service
on, or to repair or replace, any products sold or delivered by any Company or
any Company Subsidiary in connection with the Business in material excess of
that which exists in the ordinary course of business consistent with
historical levels. To the knowledge of the Companies, none of the Companies
nor any Company Subsidiary is subject to any material liability arising out of
any injury to individuals or property as a result of the ownership, possession
or use of any product designed, manufactured, assembled, sold or distributed
by or on behalf of the Business.

(b) There has been no recall, correction, market withdrawal or customer
rejection (to the extent such rejection relates to product quality) in the
past two years with respect to any products sold by the Business and, to the
knowledge of the Companies, no facts or circumstances exist that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any of the foregoing. To the knowledge
of the Companies, neither any Company nor any Company Subsidiary have
incorporated into the homes built by them any construction products that are
or have been the subject of any class action litigation.

5.23 Brokers. Other than Citigroup Global Markets Inc., no broker, finder or
similar intermediary has acted for or on behalf of any Company or any Company
Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and no broker, finder, agent or similar intermediary is entitled to
any broker's, finder's or similar fee or other commission in connection
therewith based on any agreement with any Company or any Company Subsidiary or
any action taken by them.

5.24 Exclusivity of Representations. The representations and warranties made
by the Companies in this Agreement, the Transaction Agreements and the Company
Closing Certificate are the exclusive representations and warranties made by
the Companies. The Companies hereby disclaim any other express or implied
representations or warranties, whether written or oral. The Companies are not,
directly or indirectly, making any representations or warranties regarding the
pro-forma financial information, financial projections or other forward-
looking statements of any Company or any Company Subsidiary.

7.2 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the
Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with ARTICLE

interfere with the businesses or operations of the Companies and the Company
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither any Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to disclose
any information to the Buyer, or its authorized representatives, if doing so

local or foreign Legal Requirement to which any Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party or to which any Company or any Company Subsidiary is
subject or (ii) result in the waiver of any legal privilege or work product
protection of any Company or any Company Subsidiary; provided, however, that

information relating to the Business and the Purchased Assets acquired by the
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, except (i) as required by Legal Requirements
or administrative process, (ii) statements reasonably believed to be truthful
made in court, arbitration or mediation proceedings or in documents produced
or testimony given in connection with legal process, (iii) for information
that is available to the public on the date hereof or thereafter becomes
available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Section
7.2(c) or (iv) information that has been received following the Closing by the
receiving party from a third party who, to the knowledge of the receiving
party, is not bound by a duty of confidentiality with respect to such
information; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), the
Companies shall, to the extent legally permissible, provide the Buyer with
prompt written notice of such requirements, and reasonably cooperate with the
other party (at its expense) to the extent it may seek to limit such
disclosure. 

(d) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, the Companies and their
representatives shall have reasonable access to any books, records or other
forms of information with respect to the Business transferred to the Buyer
hereunder, where there is a purpose related to the Companies' prior ownership
of the Business or the Purchased Assets, including an audit or inquiry by a
Governmental Authority, a Third Party Claim or claim, action, suit or legal
proceeding involving a Company Indemnitee. The Buyer shall allow the Companies
and their representatives reasonable access to such books and records, and
personnel with knowledge thereof and facilities related thereto, during normal
business hours. Such access shall be conducted in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of the Buyer. If the
Buyer shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the
expiration of such six-year period, the Buyer shall, prior to such
disposition, give the Companies a reasonable opportunity, at the Companies'
expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as the Companies may
select.

(e) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, the Buyer and its
representatives shall have reasonable access to any books, records or other
forms of information with respect to the Business or the Purchased Assets that
the Companies or any of their Affiliates may retain after the Closing Date,
and personnel with knowledge thereof and facilities related thereto, in each
case, during normal business hours. Such access shall be conducted in a manner
that does not unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of the
Companies. If the Companies shall desire to dispose of any of such books and
records prior to the expiration of such six-year period, the Companies shall,
prior to such disposition, give the Buyer a reasonable opportunity, at the
Buyer's expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as the Buyer
may select.

7.3 Environmental Conditions.

(c) Environmental Assessments.

(i) The Buyer shall have the right to undertake a Phase One of any Owned Real
Property.

(ii) If a Phase One of an Owned Real Property identifies any Environmental
Conditions, the Buyer shall, upon reasonable advance notice via email to the
Companies, have the right to undertake a Phase Two Environmental Site
Assessment, consisting of reasonably focused intrusive testing or sampling
addressing the Environmental Conditions identified in the Phase One (a "Phase
Two") (such Phase One and such Phase Two, if any, with respect to an Owned
Real Property are collectively referred to as an "Environmental Assessment").

(iii) The Companies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist and
cooperate with the Buyer with respect to the conduct of Environmental
Assessments. The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete
the Environmental Assessments prior to the Closing Date. If the Buyer, despite
the employment of commercially reasonable efforts to do so, is not able to
complete the Environmental Assessment with respect to an Owned Real Property
prior to the Closing Date, then the Buyer may elect to delay the transfer of
such Owned Real Property in accordance with Section 7.3(c) and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Environmental Assessments with
respect to such Owned Real Property prior to the Delayed Transfer End Date. 

(d) Response and Remediation.

(v) Not later than seven Business Days following the Buyer's receipt of an
Environmental Assessment for an Owned Real Property, the Buyer shall give
written notice to the Companies of any Environmental Condition to which the
Buyer objects, together with an explanation of the Response and Remediation
that the Buyer reasonably believes must be performed to address the
Environmental Condition. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer may not,
however, object to any Known Environmental Condition. Within five Business
Days after receiving such notice, the Companies will notify the Buyer as to
whether the Companies will undertake Response and Remediation of the
applicable Environmental Condition, it being understood that the Companies are
under no obligation to do so. If a Response and Remediation is not completed
with respect to any such Environmental Condition at or prior to the Closing,
then the Buyer may elect to delay the transfer of the affected Owned Real
Property in accordance with Section 7.3(c).

(vi) Not later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date (or such
shorter period as may be agreed to by the Companies in writing), if any Phase
One relating to a Contract Property has identified an Environmental Condition,
then if the identified Environmental Condition, in the reasonable judgment of
the Buyer, presents a significant risk of a material environmental liability
or a material adverse effect on the potential development of the Contract
Property, the Buyer may elect, by giving written notice to the Companies, to
(x) treat the Real Estate Purchase Agreement relating to such Contract
Property as an Excluded Asset and (y) reduce the Estimated Purchase Price by
the portion of the premium attributable to such Real Estate Purchase
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, following any such election by the
Buyer, the Companies shall have no restriction hereunder in connection with
the applicable Real Estate Purchase Agreement (including with respect to
termination or assignment thereof).

(e) Under the circumstances described in the last sentence of Section
7.3(a)(iii) or the last sentence of Section 7.3(b)(i), the Buyer will have the
right to delay the transfer of (i) in the case of a Company Owned Real
Property, the neighborhood (as set forth in Exhibit C) that contains the
affected Owned Real Property or (ii) in the case of a Specified Entity Owned
Real Property, the equity interests of the Specified Entity that owns the
affected Specified Entity Owned Real Property (each such Owned Real Property
or equity interests, an "Environmental Issue Asset"). The Buyer must give
written notice of its designation of any Owned Real Property or equity
interests as an Environmental Issue Asset not later than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date (or such shorter period as may be agreed to by the
Companies in writing). If the Buyer gives such a notice, the Environmental
Issue Asset will be deemed an Excluded Asset unless and until such time as it
is ultimately transferred to the Buyer in accordance herewith and the Buyer
may reduce the Estimated Purchase Price by the applicable Delayed Transfer
Reduction Amount.

(f) If, at any time prior to the Delayed Transfer End Date, (i) any
Environmental Assessment, the failure to deliver which was the cause of the
delayed transfer of an Environmental Issue Asset under Section 7.3(a)(iii), is
delivered to the Buyer and (A) such Environmental Assessment identifies no
Environmental Condition to which the Buyer objects in accordance with Section
7.3(b)(i) or (B) such Environmental Assessment identifies an Environmental
Condition to which the Buyer objects in accordance with Section 7.3(b)(i), but
the Buyer receives information from the Companies reasonably documenting the
completion of the requested Response and Remediation, (ii) the Buyer receives
information from the Companies 

reasonably documenting the completion of the requested Response and
Remediation with respect to any Environmental Issue Asset the transfer of
which was delayed under Section 7.3(b)(i) or (iii) the Buyer, in its sole
discretion, elects to purchase such Environmental Issue Asset before the
Response and Remediation is performed or completed, then (x) the Buyer shall
deliver the applicable Delayed Transfer Reduction Amount (provided, that such
Delayed Transfer Reduction Amount shall be recalculated using the Book Value
of such Environmental Issue Asset as of the date of such transfer, determined
in accordance with the Book Value Notes, and any dispute regarding such
determination shall be governed by applying Section 3.2, mutatis mutandis) in
cash by wire transfer to a bank account designated in writing by the
Companies, (y) the applicable Company or Company Subsidiary shall sell,
transfer, assign, convey and deliver such Environmental Issue Asset to the
Buyer in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (z)
the parties will execute any documents or instruments of conveyance or
assumption and take any further acts which are reasonably necessary or
desirable to effect the transfer of such Environmental Issue Asset. From and
after the consummation of any transfer contemplated by the foregoing sentence,
such Environmental Issue Asset shall be deemed a Purchased Asset.

(g) From and after the Delayed Transfer End Date, the Buyer shall have no
obligation to purchase, and the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries shall
have no obligation to sell to the Buyer, any Environmental Issue Asset. 

7.4 Public Announcements. No party will issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein will
prohibit any party from issuing or causing publication of any such press
release or public announcement to the extent that such disclosure is (a)
required by the rules of any stock exchange or (b) upon advice of counsel
required by applicable Legal Requirements, in which case the party making such
determination will, if practicable in the circumstances, use reasonable
efforts to allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release
or announcement in advance of its issuance. Nothing herein shall prevent any
party hereto or any of its Affiliates that is a private equity or other
investment fund (or a management company in respect thereof), in each case,
from making customary disclosures to (a) its direct or indirect investors or
(b) potential investors in connection with fundraising activities.

7.5 Further Assurances. Each of the parties hereto shall execute such
documents and perform such further acts as may be reasonably required to carry
out the provisions hereof and the actions contemplated hereby. Each of the
parties hereto shall, on or prior to the Closing Date, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to fulfill or obtain the fulfillment of the conditions
precedent to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the execution and delivery of any documents, certificates,
instruments or other papers that are reasonably required for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith between the date hereof and the Closing Date to
finalize the terms of the schedules to the Transition Services Agreement.

7.6 Exclusivity. Until the earlier of the Closing and such time as this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with ARTICLE 10, except for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Companies will not, and will
cause the Company Subsidiaries, and each of their respective directors,
officers, agents, employees, general partners, members, stockholders, advisors
and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, encourage or
enter into any negotiation, discussion, contract, agreement, instrument,
arrangement or understanding with any party, with respect to the sale of the
interests or all or substantially all the assets of the Companies and the
Company Subsidiaries, or any merger, recapitalization or similar transaction
with respect to the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries or the Business;
provided, that the foregoing shall not restrict any Company's or any Company
Subsidiary's ability to sell homes or lots to the home buying public pursuant
to Home Sale Contracts in the ordinary course of business.

7.7 Employee Matters.

(a) Within seven (7) days following the date of this Agreement, the Companies
shall prepare a schedule setting forth, for each employee of any Company or
Company Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement, such employee's name,
employer, title, hired date, location, whether full- or part-time, whether
active or on leave (and, if on leave, the nature of the leave and the expected
return date), whether exempt or non-exempt, annual base salary or wage rate,
accrued and unused vacation days, most recent annual bonus received, and
current annual bonus opportunity (including information regarding any
compensation increases that will be effective in January 2016). 

(b) At least seven (7) days prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer shall offer
employment in writing to any employees of the Companies and Company
Subsidiaries who are selected by the Buyer in the Buyer's sole discretion (the
"Applicable Employees"), which offers shall contain terms and conditions
consistent with Section 7.7(d) hereof. All such offers shall be subject to the
Closing and effective as of the Closing Date (or with respect to Applicable
Employees who are Inactive Employees, such later date as set forth below). All
Applicable Employees who receive such an offer from the Buyer and who commence
employment with the Buyer or its Affiliates by performing services for the
Buyer or its Affiliates are referred to herein as "Retained Employees." The
employment of each Retained Employee with the Buyer or its Affiliates shall
commence upon the date that such Retained Employee first performs services for
the Buyer or its Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, all Retained
Employees (other than Inactive Employees as set forth in Section 7.7(c)) who
accept the Buyer's employment offer shall commence employment with the Buyer
immediately following the Closing. The Companies shall cooperate and use their
reasonable commercial efforts to assist the Buyer in transitioning Retained
Employees to the Buyer as of the Closing Date.

(c) At the Closing, the Companies shall deliver to the Buyer a list
identifying each Applicable Employee who is expected to be an Inactive
Employee as of the Closing, along with the reason such Applicable Employee is
listed as an Inactive Employee and, if known to the Companies, the date such
Applicable Employee is expected to cease to be an Inactive Employee. Inactive
Employees shall remain employed by a Company or a Company Subsidiary, as the
case may be, until the earlier of the date the Inactive Employee returns to
active employment, or the expiration of the Inactive Employee's leave under
such Company's or such applicable Company Subsidiary's policies; such Inactive
Employee shall become a Retained Employee (if at all) on the first day of the
Inactive Employee's actual return to work from the leave.

(d) From and after the Closing Date until the six-month anniversary thereof
(such period, the "Initial Employment Period"), the Buyer shall provide to
each Retained Employee (i) a base salary or base wages at an annual or hourly
rate, as applicable, that is either, at the Buyer's sole discretion: (A) no
less than the average base salary or base wages paid to similarly situated
employees of the Buyer and its Affiliates during the Initial Employment
Period, or (B) no less than the base salary or base wages paid to such
Retained Employee immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) an annual cash
incentive opportunity (e.g., performance bonus), and employee benefits that
are in the aggregate no less favorable than those provided to similarly
situated employees of the Buyer and its Affiliates during the Initial
Employment Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall
preclude the Buyer or its Affiliates from terminating the employment of any
Retained Employee at any time after the Closing, in the Buyer's or its
Affiliate's sole discretion.

(e) The Buyer shall be responsible for all severance payments that become due
and owing under the terms of the severance schedule set forth on Schedule
7.7(e) hereto (such schedule, the "Severance Schedule"), except as otherwise
provided in this Section 7.7(e). If one of the Companies directly pays an
amount owed pursuant to the Severance Schedule, the Buyer shall promptly
reimburse the Companies for such amount upon receiving a written notice from
the Companies (which is undisputed by the Buyer or which, following a dispute
from the Buyer, is finally resolved in favor of the Companies) specifying the
amount of the severance, the name of the individual entitled to such
severance, the date of termination and 

a brief description regarding the reason for the termination of employment and
the Companies acknowledge and agree that Buyer shall not be liable or
responsible for making any severance payments directly to such individual. The
obligations of the Buyer pursuant to the first two sentences of this Section
7.7(e) are referred to herein as the "Buyer Severance Cost". The Companies and
the Buyer agree that all amounts payable under the Severance Schedule shall be
conditioned upon the applicable employee executing and not revoking a release
of all claims in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and the
Companies. The Companies and the Company Subsidiaries shall be solely
responsible for, and have all liability with respect to, any and all other
severance or similar obligations under their respective severance or other
policies, plans, agreements, and practices (i.e., any such severance amounts
that are not set forth on the Severance Schedule, including any amounts that
may be owed under the Employee Retention Plan for JW Homes to the extent not
set forth on the Severance Schedule) (collectively, the "Company Severance
Costs"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Companies shall be responsible for,
and the Buyer shall have no liability in respect of, any "Success Bonus"
amounts payable pursuant to the Employee Retention Plan for JW Homes.

(f) Each Retained Employee's service with the Companies and Company
Subsidiaries, and any prior service with the Buyer and its Affiliates, in each
case prior to the Closing Date, will be recognized as if it had been service
with the Buyer or its Affiliates, as applicable, for all purposes, including
participation, coverage, vesting and level of benefits (but not for purposes
of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan), as applicable,
under all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements of the
Buyer and its Affiliates, including, for the avoidance of doubt, severance and
vacation benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall result
in the duplication of any benefits. With respect to each Retained Employee,
effective at the Closing, the Buyer and its Affiliates shall, or shall cause
their employee benefit plans to, allow Retained Employees to commence
participation, subject to the terms and conditions of each such employee
benefit plan, and waive (or, with respect to plans and programs insured
through third party insurance carriers, use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause insurance carriers to waive) any pre-existing condition, limitation or
exclusion, any actively-at-work requirement, evidence of insurability
requirement or eligibility waiting period.

(g) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, the Companies will pay
to each Retained Employee an amount in satisfaction of the balance of that
Retained Employee's accrued and unused paid time-off days (determined as of
the date that the Retained Employee separates from employment with the
Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable), less all applicable
withholdings.

(h) The Companies shall retain all obligations to provide continued health
coverage in accordance with COBRA (such coverage, "COBRA Coverage") to (i) all
Retained Employees (and their qualified beneficiaries) with respect to
qualifying events that occur prior to, in connection with or as a result of
the Closing until such time as such Retained Employees (and their qualified
beneficiaries) commence participation as an active employee in the Buyer's
group health plan, and (ii) all other current or former employees of the
Companies (and their qualified beneficiaries) (such employees and qualified
beneficiaries in clauses (i) and (ii), the "COBRA-Eligible Individuals"). The
Companies will maintain a group health plan that provides COBRA Coverage to
such COBRA-Eligible Individuals for so long as any such COBRA-Eligible
Individual is entitled to, or is entitled to elect, COBRA Coverage. If the
Companies cease to provide COBRA Coverage to any such COBRA-Eligible
Individuals, and 

as a result such COBRA-Eligible Individual is entitled to elect, and so
elects, continued group health coverage under Buyer's group health plan
pursuant to COBRA, the Companies shall reimburse the Buyer for claims paid to
such individuals by the Buyer reduced by (x) premiums paid by such individuals
associated with such COBRA Coverage and (y) amounts reimbursed to the Buyer
under any stop-loss or other related insurance policy.

(i) The Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective employee benefit plans
shall be responsible for all health and welfare benefit claims incurred by any
Retained Employee (or any eligible dependent of a Retained Employee) on or
after the date that each such Retained Employee's employment commences with
the Buyer or its Affiliate in accordance with Section 7.7(b). For this
purpose, claims for health benefits shall be considered to be incurred when
the services related to such claims were provided, and claims for other
welfare benefits shall be considered to be incurred when the date of
disability, injury or loss, as applicable, occurred.

(j) Subject to, and effective as of, the Closing, the Companies hereby waive
and release each of the Retained Employees from any post-termination
contractual restrictions enforceable by the Companies on the employment,
activities or other conduct of such individuals after their employment or
service commences with the Buyer to the extent necessary to permit the
Retained Employees to provide services to the Buyer; provided, that the
foregoing waiver and release shall not apply with respect to obligations
related to confidentiality, trade secrets and non-solicitation of employees.

(k) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.7, nothing
contained herein, whether expressed or implied, (i) shall be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement maintained by the Companies, the Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates, (ii) shall limit the right of the Buyer, the Companies or any of
their respective Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify (or cause
to be amended, terminated or otherwise modified) any employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement in accordance with its terms, or (iii) create any
obligation on the part of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates to continue the
employment of any employee for any definite period. The Companies and the
Buyer acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this Section 7.7
are included for the sole benefit of the Buyer, the Companies and their
respective Affiliates, and that nothing herein, whether express or implied,
shall create any third-party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other
person, including any employees, former employees, or any participant (or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof) in any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement maintained by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or (ii) to
continued employment with the Companies, the Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates or continued participation in any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement.

(l) The parties agree to cooperate in good faith to determine whether any
notification may be required under the WARN Act as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Buyer will be responsible for
providing any notification that may be required after the Closing under the
WARN Act with respect to any Retained Employees. The Companies will be
responsible for providing any notification that may be required at or prior to
the Closing under the WARN Act with respect to any employees who are not
Retained Employees. 

7.8 Real Estate and Personal Property Taxes. Real estate and personal property
Taxes will be included in the calculation of the Base Book Value Amount, Book
Value Estimate and Final Book Value (based on a daily proration determined in
accordance with Schedule 7.8) and governed exclusively by Section 3.2.

7.9 Other Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
and except as set forth in Section 7.8:

(i) The Companies shall be liable for and shall pay, and pursuant to Section
11.2, the Companies agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer from and
against, (i) any and all Taxes applicable to or arising from the Business, the
Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities (such Taxes to include, but not
be limited to, any sales or use Taxes required to be collected and remitted by
the Companies or in connection with the Business and any Taxes or penalties
resulting from the Companies' failure to register to collect sales or use
Taxes in any jurisdiction in which it was required to have been so
registered), other than any Transfer Taxes, in each case attributable to
taxable years or periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the
Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and (ii) any and all
income Taxes of the Companies applicable to or arising from the sale or
transfer of the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities
pursuant to this Agreement or from the extinguishment or retirement of any
indebtedness or other obligations of any Company or related to the Business or
Purchased Assets (other than the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (in each case
whether assessed or unassessed and including, any amount relating to Taxes
pursuant to a contract or otherwise) (subsections (i) and (ii) together, the
"Indemnified Taxes"). For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of
Indemnified Taxes payable with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of
any such Taxes that are allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on and including the Closing Date shall: (x) in the case of Taxes that are
based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount
that would be payable if the Tax year or period ended on the Closing Date; and
(y) in the case of all other Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding Tax
period) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire Straddle Period. Any Indemnified Tax determined with reference
to assets held, or otherwise measured by the level of any item thereof, at a
particular time shall, for purposes of this Section 7.9, be calculated with
reference to the assets held, or the level of such item, at the end of the
Closing Date.

(j) Subject to Section 7.9(c), the Buyer shall be liable for and shall pay,
and pursuant to Section 11.2, the Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries from and against any and all Taxes
applicable to or arising from the Business, the Purchased Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities, to the extent such Taxes are not Indemnified Taxes or
Transfer Taxes.

(k) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 7.9 to the contrary,
the payment of Transfer Taxes shall not be governed by this Section 7.9, but
shall instead be governed by Section 3.6 above. 

(l) The Companies or the Buyer, as the case may be, shall provide
reimbursement for any Tax paid by one party all or a portion of which is the
responsibility of the other party in accordance with the terms of this Section
7.9. Within a reasonable time prior to the payment of any said Tax, the party
paying such Tax (the "Tax Indemnified Party") shall give notice to the other
party (the "Tax Indemnifying Party") of the Tax payable and the portion which
is the liability of each party (a "Tax Indemnity Notice"), although failure to
do so will not relieve the other party from its liability hereunder. The Tax
Indemnifying Party shall have a period of fifteen (15) Business Days after the
delivery of the Tax Indemnity Notice to present in writing to the Tax
Indemnified Party notice of any objections to the contents of such notice.
Unless the Tax Indemnifying Party timely objects, the allocation of Taxes
provided in the Tax Indemnity Notice shall be binding on the parties without
further adjustment, absent manifest error. If the Tax Indemnifying Party shall
raise any objections within the relevant period, the Buyer and the Companies
shall negotiate in good faith and use their reasonable best efforts to resolve
such dispute. If the parties fail to agree within fifteen (15) days after the
delivery of the objecting notice, then the disputed items shall be resolved by
the Accounting Firm, whose determination shall be final and binding on the
parties. The Accounting Firm shall resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days
after the item has been referred to it. The costs, fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by the Companies and the Buyer.

(m) After the Closing Date, each of the Companies and the Buyer shall (and
shall cause its respective Affiliates to):

(i) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party
is responsible for preparing and filing;

(ii) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with Tax
Authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Business or the Purchased
Assets;

(iii) make available to the other and to any Tax Authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the
Business or the Purchased Assets;

(iv) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or
threatened Tax audits or assessments relating to Taxes of the Business or the
Purchased Assets for taxable periods for which the other may have a liability
under this Section 7.9; and

(v) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any Tax
Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with respect
to any such taxable period.

(n) The Companies shall control the conduct, through counsel of their own
choosing at its own expense, of any audit, claim for refund, or administrative
or judicial proceeding involving any asserted Tax liability or refund with
respect to the Business or the Purchased Assets (any such audit, claim for
refund, or proceeding relating to an asserted Tax liability referred to herein
as a "Contest") relating to taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or
before the Closing Date.

(o) In the case of a Contest that relates to Straddle Periods, the Buyer and
the Companies shall jointly control the conduct of such Contest. Neither the
Buyer 

nor the Companies shall settle, compromise and/or concede such Contest without
the consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

7.10 Bulk Transfer Laws. The Buyer and the Companies hereby waive compliance
by the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries with any applicable bulk
transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the Purchased
Assets to the Buyer.

7.11 Title, Survey and Zoning Matters.

(l) The Buyer will obtain from the Title Company and deliver to the Companies
promptly following the date hereof, a commitment for title insurance for each
parcel of Homebuilding Property (each, a "Title Commitment" and collectively,
the "Title Commitments") and a Survey and Property Zoning Report for each
parcel of Homebuilding Property, all at Buyer's sole cost.

(m) With respect to each parcel of Homebuilding Property, not later than seven
(7) days following the Buyer's receipt of the last of the Title Commitment,
Survey and Property Zoning Report (the "Property Review Documents") for that
parcel (the "Initial Objection Date"), the Buyer shall give written notice (an
"Initial Objection Notice") to the Companies of any exceptions, issues or
requirements contained in the Property Review Documents to which the Buyer
objects ("Material Initial Exceptions"). Further, if and to the extent any
Property Review Document is revised prior to the Closing Date, not later than
five (5) Business Days following the Buyer's receipt of any such revised
Property Review Document, the Buyer may give written notice (a "Supplemental
Objection Notice"; collectively with the Initial Objection Notice, the
"Objection Notices") to the Companies of new requirements, issues or
exceptions not reflected in the original Property Review Documents or
modifications of existing requirements, issues or exceptions reflected in the
original Property Review Documents to which the Buyer objects ("Material
Supplemental Exceptions"; collectively with the Material Initial Exceptions,
the "Material Exceptions"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer may not
object in any Objection Notice to items that are Permitted Encumbrances and no
Permitted Encumbrance may constitute a Material Exception (for purposes of
this sentence, however, the definition of "Permitted Encumbrances" shall be
read without clause (xi)). Additionally, Buyer may not object to matters shown
in a Property Zoning Report unless such objection is to a Homebuilding
Property's failure to be zoned for residential use or to be in material
compliance with any zoning requirements.

(n) The Companies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist and
cooperate with the Buyer in addressing the Buyer's comments to the Property
Review Documents, regardless of whether such items are the subject of an
Objection Notice or are Material Exceptions. However, (i) the Companies have
no obligation to incur any third party costs or liabilities in connection with
such commercially reasonable efforts and (ii) with respect to any Contract
Property, none of the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries nor the Specified
Entities have any obligation to take any actions or efforts that are not
permitted to be taken by the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries or the
Specified Entities, in each case, in their capacity as purchaser under the
applicable Real Estate Purchase Agreement. If a Material Exception contained
in any Objection Notice is not removed or corrected at or prior to Closing,
then the Buyer may elect to delay the transfer of the affected Title Issue
Asset in accordance with Section 7.11(f). 

(o) The Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed to accept title to the Owned Real
Property at the Closing subject to any or all of the following matters
("Permitted Exceptions"):

(i) exceptions that do not constitute Material Exceptions;

(ii) exceptions that would otherwise constitute Material Exceptions but
regarding which the Buyer does not timely deliver an Objection Notice in
accordance with Section 7.11(b);

(iii) exceptions that constitute Material Exceptions for any Owned Real
Property that the Buyer does not elect to treat as a Title Issue Asset; and

(iv) exceptions that constitute Material Exceptions for any Owned Real
Property that Buyer has elected to treat as a Title Issue Asset, but later
elects to purchase prior to the cure or correction of such Material
Exceptions, as contemplated by the last sentence of Section 7.11(f).

(p) The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and the Companies
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist and cooperate with the
Buyer's efforts (with no obligation to incur any third party costs or
liabilities in connection with such commercially reasonable efforts to assist
and cooperate) to, obtain an irrevocable "marked-up" commitment from the Title
Company at or prior to the Closing Date to issue the Title Policies. The Buyer
shall pay all of the base premium costs, all endorsement costs, and all other
fees, costs and expenses with respect to the Title Policies. In order to
obtain the Title Policies, the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries and the
Specified Entities shall be required to deliver the following documents to the
Title Company: (i) Owner's Affidavit and GAP Indemnity (the form of which is
set forth on Exhibit J), (ii) Non-Imputation Affidavit and Indemnity (the form
of which is set forth on Exhibit K), and (iii) financial information and
information regarding on-going construction (collectively, "Title Documents").
If the Title Company has not issued an irrevocable "marked-up" commitment to
issue a Title Policy with respect to any Owned Real Property at or prior to
the Closing Date, then the Buyer may elect to delay the transfer of the
affected Title Issue Asset in accordance with Section 7.11(f).

(q) Under the circumstances described in the last sentence of Section 7.11(c)
or the last sentence of Section 7.11(e), the Buyer will have the right to
delay the transfer of (i) in the case of a Company Owned Real Property, the
neighborhood (as set forth in Exhibit C) that contains the affected Owned Real
Property, (ii) in the case of a Specified Entity Owned Real Property, the
equity interests of the Specified Entity that owns the affected Specified
Entity Owned Real Property or (iii) solely under the circumstances described
in the last sentence of Section 7.11(c), in the case of a Contract Property,
the Real Estate Purchase Agreement of which the affected Contract Property is
the subject (each such Owned Real Property, equity interests or Real Estate
Purchase Agreement, a "Title Issue Asset"). The Buyer must give written notice
of its designation of any Owned Real Property, equity interests or Real Estate
Purchase Agreement as a Title Issue Asset not later than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date (or such shorter period as may be agreed to by the
Companies in writing). If the Buyer gives such a notice, the Title Issue Asset
will be deemed an Excluded Asset until such time as it is ultimately
transferred to the Buyer in accordance herewith and the Buyer may reduce the
Estimated Purchase Price by the Delayed Transfer Reduction Amount. Following
any such election to delay 

transfer of a Title Issue Asset, the Companies shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to correct or address the matter which caused the transfer
delay before the Delayed Transfer End Date. However, (x) the Companies have no
obligation to incur any third party costs or liabilities in connection with
such commercially reasonable efforts and (y) with respect to any Contract
Property, none of the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries nor the Specified
Entities have any obligation to take any actions or efforts that are not
permitted to be taken by the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries or the
Specified Entities, in each case, in their capacity as purchaser under the
applicable Real Estate Purchase Agreement. The Buyer may, in its sole
discretion, elect to purchase such Title Issue Asset before such matter is
corrected or addressed or before the Title Company has issued a "marked-up"
irrevocable commitment to issue a Title Policy with respect thereto, in
accordance with Section 7.11(g), but subject to Section 7.11(h).

(r) If, at any time prior to the Delayed Transfer End Date, (i) the Buyer
receives information from the Companies reasonably documenting (A) the removal
or correction of the applicable Material Exceptions (if any) to the Buyer's
reasonable satisfaction and (B) solely in the case of any Owned Real Property,
the Title Company has issued a "marked-up" irrevocable commitment to issue a
Title Policy with respect to the Title Issue Asset, or (ii) the Buyer elects,
by delivery of written notice to the Companies, to close on the purchase of
the Title Issue Asset before the applicable Material Exceptions (if any) are
removed or corrected and the Title Company issues an irrevocable "marked-up"
commitment to issue a Title Policy, as applicable, then (x) the Buyer shall
deliver the applicable Delayed Transfer Reduction Amount (provided, that such
Delayed Transfer Reduction Amount shall be recalculated using the Book Value
of such Title Issue Asset as of the date of such transfer, determined in
accordance with the Book Value Notes, and any dispute regarding such
determination shall be governed by applying Section 3.2, mutatis mutandis) in
cash by wire transfer to a bank account designated in writing by the
Companies, (y) the applicable Company or Company Subsidiary shall sell,
transfer, assign, convey and deliver such Title Issue Asset to the Buyer in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (z) the parties
will execute any documents or instruments of conveyance or assumption and take
any further acts which are reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the
transfer of such Title Issue Asset. From and after the consummation of any
transfer contemplated by the foregoing sentence, such Title Issue Asset shall
be deemed a Purchased Asset.

(s) From and after the Delayed Transfer End Date, the Buyer shall have no
obligation to purchase, and the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries shall
have no obligation to sell, any Title Issue Asset.

(t) Nothing in this Section 7.11 shall limit the Companies' obligations under
this Agreement, including Section 7.1(b)(ix). 

7.12 FIRPTA Certificate. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Companies shall
deliver to the Buyer a certificate in compliance with Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1445-2, certifying that neither Company is a foreign person.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Buyer's sole
right if the Companies fail to provide such certificate or certificates shall
be to make an appropriate withholding under Sections 897 and 1445 of the Code.

7.13 Support Obligations.

(n) Cash Bonds. Pursuant to Section 2.1(t), at the Closing, the Companies and
the Company Subsidiaries shall transfer the cash collateral deposits shown as
"Transferred to Buyer" in Item 9 of Exhibit B, and as also listed on Schedule
7.13(a) ("Cash Bonds") to the Buyer and, pursuant to Section 2.3(d), the Buyer
shall assume certain liabilities and obligations in connection therewith,
including any liabilities and obligations backstopped thereby.

(o) Letters of Credit. The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries and all lenders to be
unconditionally released in full from any liability or obligation in respect
of any letter of credit or similar ancillary obligation or amount issued for
the account of a Company or a Company Subsidiary or in connection with any
liability or obligation of a Company or Company Subsidiary and that is listed
on Schedule 7.13(b) ("Letters of Credit"), without further recourse to any
such Person, at or prior to the Closing, by replacing each Letter of Credit
with a new letter of credit or similar instrument issued by or on behalf of
the Buyer in form and substance acceptable to the applicable Governmental
Authority. If any Letter of Credit is not unconditionally released or
extinguished in full at or prior to the Closing, at or prior to the Closing
the Buyer shall or shall cause one or more "back stop" letters of credit or
cash collateral arrangements, from financial institutions, in amounts and on
terms reasonably satisfactory to the Companies and the applicable lender, to
be issued for the benefit of the applicable lender to guarantee the
reimbursement to such lender of any amounts paid by it under or in respect of
the applicable Letter of Credit following the Closing, which "back stop"
letters of credit (or renewals thereof) or cash collateral arrangements shall
remain in full force and effect until the underlying liability or obligation
has been unconditionally released or extinguished in full. The Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless any such lender, the Companies, and any of their
Affiliates from and against any Losses suffered or incurred by them in
connection with any of the foregoing Letters of Credit from and after the
Closing.

(p) Insured Bonds. From and after the Closing, the Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly (x) cause the Companies, the
Company Subsidiaries, JW Parent and all sureties to be unconditionally
released in full from any liability or obligation in respect of any surety or
performance bond or similar ancillary obligation or amount issued for the
account of a Company, a Company Subsidiary or JW Parent or in connection with
any liability or obligation of a Company, Company Subsidiary or JW Parent and
that is listed on Schedule 7.13(c) ("Insured Bonds"), without further recourse
to any such Person and (y) replace each Insured Bond with one or more surety
or performance bonds or letters of credit or other forms of security, in
amounts and on terms satisfactory to the applicable Governmental Authority or
other beneficiary to guarantee the reimbursement to such Governmental
Authority or other beneficiary of any amounts paid by it under or in respect
of the applicable Insured Bond following the Closing, which bond(s) shall
remain in full force and effect until such the underlying liability or
obligation has been unconditionally released or extinguished in full. If any
Insured Bond is not 

unconditionally released or extinguished in full at or prior to the date that
is ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the applicable Company or Company
Subsidiary or JW Parent shall be permitted to terminate such Insured Bond;
provided, that following the Closing, the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries
and JW Parent shall have no obligation to pay any renewal fee or premium in
respect of any Insured Bond. The Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Companies, the Company Subsidiaries, JW Parent and any of their Affiliates
from and against any Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with
any of the foregoing Insured Bonds from and after the Closing, including any
expenses or fees incurred in connection with any such Insured Bond being
called or terminated. 

7.14 Change in Corporate Name. Each of the Companies agrees promptly after the
Closing to (i) change its respective corporate name and (ii) cause the Company
Subsidiaries to change their respective names, in each case, to a name that
does not include the words "John Wieland," "JW," JW Homes," "Wieland" or any
variation thereof.

7.15 Restrictive Covenants.

(a) In furtherance of the sale of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer hereunder
by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby and more effectively to
protect the value and goodwill of the Purchased Assets and the Business, the
Companies hereby covenant and agree that, for the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Companies shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates that are controlled by the Companies not to: (i)
solicit, induce or attempt to persuade any Retained Employee or any agent or
supplier of the Business to terminate such employment, agency, supply or
business relationship; or (ii) disparage the Business, the Buyer, any of the
Buyer's Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, managers,
members, stockholders, employees or agents; provided, further, that the
restriction contained in the foregoing clause (ii) shall not apply to truthful
statements made in court, arbitration or mediation proceedings or in documents
produced or testimony given in connection with legal process associated with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing
clause (i), none of the Companies, any Company Subsidiary nor any of their
respective Affiliates that are controlled by the Companies shall be precluded
from (x) hiring any Retained Employee at least six (6) months after his or her
employment with the Buyer or its Affiliates was terminated or (y) employing or
contacting any person as a result of general solicitations not specifically
directed at the Buyer or its employees; provided, that none of the Companies,
the Company Subsidiaries nor any such Affiliates shall be entitled to commence
any employment discussions with the Persons listed on Schedule 7.15(a) prior
to the date that is six (6) months following the termination of employment of
such Person by the Buyer or one of its Affiliates.

(b) If either of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates that are controlled by either of the Companies or the
Company Subsidiaries violates any of its obligations under this Section 7.15,
the Buyer may proceed against it in law or in equity for such damages or other
relief as a court may deem appropriate. The Companies hereby acknowledge that
a violation of this Section 7.15 would cause the Buyer irreparable harm which
would not be adequately compensated for by money damages. The Companies
therefore agree that in the event of any violation of this Section 7.15, the
Buyer shall be entitled, in addition to other remedies that it may have, to a
temporary restraining order and to preliminary and final injunctive relief
against either of the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries or such Affiliate
that is controlled by either of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, to prevent any violations of this Section 7.15, without the
necessity of posting a bond. It is the intent and understanding of each party
hereto that if, in any action before any Governmental Authority legally
empowered to enforce this Section 7.15, any term, restriction, covenant or
promise in this Section 7.15 is found to be unreasonable and for that reason
unenforceable, then such term, restriction, covenant or promise shall be
deemed modified to the extent necessary to make it enforceable by such
Governmental Authority. 

7.16 Misdirected Assets. From and after the Closing Date, to the extent that
the Buyer, on the one hand, or the Companies or any of their Affiliates, on
the other hand, is in possession of any assets (including, in the case of the
Companies or their Affiliates, any Purchased Asset, or in the case of the
Buyer, any Excluded Assets) as to which the other is entitled or to which the
other is entitled to the benefit of, in each case, pursuant to this Agreement
(the "Misdirected Assets"), the Buyer or the Companies, as applicable, upon
becoming aware of such fact, shall promptly use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Person having possession of such asset to cause the
transfer, assignment, conveyance and delivery of such Misdirected Asset to the
other party or its designated Affiliate, in each case without the payment of
any additional consideration.

7.17 Lanier Joint Venture. Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the
Companies shall use commercially reasonably efforts to extend the term of the
Joint Venture Agreement between JW Homes and Hardeman Properties, Inc., for
six months or such other period of time that is mutually agreed by the
Companies and the Buyer.

reasonable attorneys' fees), claims, suits, actions and damages (collectively,
"Losses") that any Buyer Indemnitee incurs arising from, relating to or in
connection with (i) the breach of any of the Company Representations (other
than the Specified Representations of the Companies and the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 5.11 (Taxes)); (ii) the breach of (A) any
Specified Representations of the Companies or (B) the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 5.11 (Taxes); (iii) the breach of any covenant
or agreement made hereunder by the Companies; (iv) any Excluded Liability; and
(v) any liabilities or obligations of the Specified Entities that would not
constitute Assumed Liabilities if such liabilities or obligations were
liabilities or obligations of one of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries
and all of the assets of the Specified Entities constituted Purchased Assets,
but only to the extent any such liability or obligation becomes a direct
liability or obligation of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (other than any
Specified Entity or BHI or any of their respective Subsidiaries), excluding
(x) any debt owed by any Specified Entity or BHI to any Company or any Company 

Subsidiary and (y) any such liability or obligation taken into account in the
calculation of the Final Purchase Price or reflected in or reserved against in
the Financial Statements.

(f) Subject to the limitations set forth herein, from and after the Closing
Date, the Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Company
Indemnitee from and against any Losses that any Company Indemnitee incurs
arising from relating to or in connection with (i) the breach of any
representation or warranty of the Buyer in this Agreement (other than the
Specified Representations of the Buyer); (ii) the breach of any Specified
Representation of the Buyer and the breach of any covenant or agreement made
hereunder by the Buyer; and (iii) any Assumed Liability.

(g) For the purposes of determining under this Section 11.2 (i) whether any
representation is inaccurate or whether there has been a breach of any
warranty and (ii) the amount of any Losses arising from such inaccuracy or
breach, such representation and warranty shall be considered without regard to
any qualification by or reference to the words "Material Adverse Effect,"
"material," "materiality," "in all material respects," "would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the
Purchased Assets" or any similar words or qualifications contained therein
(other than any qualification or reference contained in (x) the definition of
any defined term used herein or (y) the representations and warranties set
forth in any of Sections 5.5, 5.6(a), 5.8, 5.13(a), 5.13(b) or 5.20).

11.3 Limitations on Indemnification.

(m) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall the cumulative indemnification obligations of (x) the Companies under
Section 11.2(a)(i) exceed an amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow Amount or
(y) the Buyer under Section 11.2(b)(i) exceed an amount equal to the Indemnity
Escrow Amount; provided, however, that the limitations set forth in the first
sentence of this Section 11.3(a) shall not apply to Losses arising out of or
related to Fraud. Further, the cumulative indemnification obligations of the
Companies under Section 11.2(a), or the Buyer under Section 11.2(b), shall in
no event in the aggregate exceed the amount of net proceeds the Companies
received as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
limitations set forth in the immediately preceding sentence of this Section
11.3(a) shall not apply to Losses incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee arising out
of or related to (i) the matters described in Section 11.2(a)(v) or (ii) any
Excluded Liability, or by any Company Indemnitee arising out of or related to
any Assumed Liability.

(n) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no

or the Buyer Indemnitees, respectively, under, (A) in the case of Losses
indemnifiable by the Companies pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i) or (B) in the
case of Losses indemnifiable by the Buyer pursuant to Section 11.2(b)(i),
unless the aggregate amount of Losses that would otherwise be payable under
Section 11.2(a)(i) or Section 11.2(b)(i), respectively, exceeds $2,000,000
(the "Basket Amount"), whereupon the Company Indemnitee or the Buyer
Indemnitee, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive only amounts for
Losses in excess of the Basket Amount; provided, however, that the limitations
set forth in this Section 11.3(b) shall not apply to Losses arising out of or
related to any Fraud. 

(o) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless the
Companies determine otherwise in their sole discretion, indemnification
payments to any Buyer Indemnitee pursuant this ARTICLE 11 first shall be made
from the Indemnity Escrow Account until the Indemnity Escrow Account is
exhausted. Any payment made from the Indemnity Escrow Account to any Buyer
Indemnitee on behalf of (or for the benefit of) the Companies shall constitute
full satisfaction of any obligation of the Companies to make such payment to
the applicable Buyer Indemnitee.

(p) Under no circumstances shall any Indemnitee be entitled to be indemnified
for any indirect, consequential, punitive, exemplary or other special damages;
provided, that the foregoing exclusion shall not include any damages of the
types described above that are payable to a third party or any indirect,
consequential, or other special damages that are reasonably foreseeable based
on the underlying breach and not speculative. The party seeking
indemnification under this ARTICLE 11 shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts (x) to mitigate any Losses that form the basis of an indemnification
claim hereunder to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements (it
being understood that any reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs or expenses
incurred in connection with such mitigation shall themselves constitute
Losses, to the extent the Losses mitigated would have been indemnifiable
pursuant to this ARTICLE 11, but not in an amount in excess of the amount by
which such Losses were actually mitigated) and (y) to make all available
claims against any existing applicable third party insurance policies,
including the Title Policies.

(q) No party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person with
respect to (i) any representation, warranty, covenant or condition
specifically waived in writing by the other party on or prior to the Closing,
(ii) any Losses with respect to any matter if such matter was included in the
calculation of the adjustment to the Estimated Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 3.2 or (iii) for any Losses for which a Claims Notice was not duly
delivered prior to the applicable Cut-Off Date. 

11.4 Indemnification Claim Process. Except as otherwise provided in Section
7.9:

(a) All claims for indemnification by either a Company Indemnitee or a Buyer
Indemnitee under this ARTICLE 11 shall be asserted and resolved in accordance
with Section 11.4 and Section 11.5.

(b) If a Buyer Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification pursuant to this
ARTICLE 11 in respect of any Third Party Claim, such Buyer Indemnitee shall
promptly notify the Companies in writing of such claim, describing such claim
in reasonable detail and the amount or estimated amount of such Losses (to the
extent then known) (the "Claims Notice"); provided, that failure to give such
notice shall not relieve the Companies of their obligations hereunder except
to the extent the Companies shall have been actually prejudiced by such
failure.

(c) If a Company Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification pursuant to this
ARTICLE 11 in respect of any Third Party Claim, such Company Indemnitee shall
promptly deliver a Claims Notice to the Buyer; provided, that failure to give
such notice shall not relieve the Buyer of its obligations hereunder except to
the extent the Buyer shall have been actually prejudiced by such failure.

(d) The Indemnitor shall have thirty (30) days from the date on which the
Indemnitor received the Claims Notice to notify the Indemnitee that the
Indemnitor desires to assume the defense or prosecution of such Third Party
Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice and at
its own expense; provided, that if the Indemnitor is a Company (x) the cost of
such defense may be funded from the Indemnity Escrow Account and (y) such
Indemnitor shall not have the right to defend or direct the defense of any
such Third Party Claim that seeks an injunction or other equitable relief
against the Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor assumes the defense of such claim in
accordance herewith: (i) the Indemnitee may retain separate co-counsel at its
sole cost and expense (provided, that if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel
to the Indemnitee, there exists a conflict of interest between the Indemnitor
and the Indemnitee that cannot be waived, the Indemnitor shall be liable for
the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to the Indemnitee in each
jurisdiction for which the Indemnitee reasonably determines counsel is
required) and participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim, but the
Indemnitor shall control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof;
(ii) the Indemnitee shall not file any papers or consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and (iii) the Indemnitor shall
not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee unless the judgment or settlement provides solely for the payment
of money, the Indemnitor (or, if the Indemnitor is a Company, the Escrow Agent
from the Indemnity Escrow Account) makes such payment (subject to the
applicable limitations contained herein) and the Indemnitee receives an
unconditional release. The parties shall act in good faith in responding to,
defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with Third Party Claims, and
cooperate in any such defense and give each other reasonable access to all
information relevant thereto. Whether or not the Indemnitor has assumed the
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor will not be obligated to
indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any settlement entered into
or any judgment consented to without the 

Indemnitor's prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(e) If the Indemnitor does not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Claims Notice, elects in writing not
to defend any Third Party Claim for which it has assumed the defense, fails to
diligently prosecute the defense of such Third Party Claim or is not entitled
to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 11.4(d),
the Indemnitee will be entitled to assume such defense, at its sole cost and
expense (or, if the Indemnitee incurs a Loss with respect to the matter in
question for which the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
ARTICLE 11, at the expense of the Indemnitor), upon delivery of notice to such
effect to the Indemnitor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Indemnitor
shall have the right to participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim at
its sole cost and expense; (ii) except if the Indemnitor is not entitled to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 11.4(d), the
Indemnitor may at any time thereafter assume defense of the Third Party Claim,
in which event the Indemnitor shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and
expenses of the Indemnitee's counsel incurred prior to such assumption by the
Indemnitor of defense of the Third Party Claim; and (iii) the Indemnitor shall
not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder for any settlement
entered into or any judgment consented to without the Indemnitor's prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(f) The Indemnitee shall provide reasonable cooperation with the Indemnitor in
all aspects of any investigation, defense, pretrial activities, trial,
compromise, settlement or discharge of any claim in respect of which an
Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE 11 that the
Indemnitor has elected to control, including by providing the Indemnitor with
reasonable access to books, records, employees and officers (including as
witnesses) of the Indemnitee.

11.5 Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 7.9(b), the Indemnitee will deliver a Claims
Notice to the Indemnitor promptly upon its discovery of any matter for which
the Indemnitor may be liable to the Indemnitee hereunder that does not involve
a Third Party Claim, which Claims Notice shall also state (to the extent then
known) (a) that the Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued Losses or
anticipates that it will incur liability for Losses for which such Indemnitee
is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, and (b) if paid or
accrued, the date such item was paid or accrued; provided, that failure to
give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent the Indemnitor shall have been actually prejudiced by
such failure. The Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate and assist the
Indemnitor in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the
Indemnitee and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and
cooperation shall include providing reasonable access to and copies of
information, records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing
employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of such
matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such
matters. 

11.6 Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except
(i) in connection with a dispute under Section 3.2 (which shall be governed
exclusively by Section 3.2) or Section 7.9 (which shall be governed
exclusively by Section 7.9), (ii) in respect of a matter for which specific
performance is available under Section 11.12 or (iii) in the case of Fraud,
the indemnification provisions of this ARTICLE 11 and the Escrow Agreement
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnitees and the
Company Indemnitees following the Closing for any and all breaches or alleged
breaches of any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties, or any other provision of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

11.7 Calculation of Losses; Limitations. The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this ARTICLE 11 shall be net of any amounts
actually recovered by any Indemnitee under any third party insurance policies,
including the Title Policies (net of any expenses incurred to recover such
amounts) or any other source of indemnification with respect to such Loss
(including, with respect to the Warranty Liabilities, the Warranty Services
Agreement) and shall be reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit
realized by the Indemnitee arising from the incurrence or payment of any such
Loss. In computing the amount of any such Tax benefit, the Indemnitee shall be
deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit
before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment
hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss. In the event
that an insurance or other recovery (including a recovery under the Title
Policies) is made by any Indemnitee or a Tax benefit is realized by an
Indemnitee, in each case with respect to any Loss for which any such
Indemnitee has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the amount
of such recovery or Tax benefit shall be made promptly to the Indemnitor that
made or directed such indemnification payments to such Indemnitee.

11.8 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Unless otherwise required by
applicable Law, any indemnity payment made under this Agreement shall be
treated by all parties as an adjustment to the purchase price for all federal,
state, local and foreign Tax purposes, and the parties shall file their Tax
Returns accordingly.

11.9 Subrogation. In the event of payment by or on behalf of any Indemnitor to
any Indemnitee (including pursuant to this ARTICLE 11) in connection with any
claim or demand by any Person other than the parties hereto or their
respective Affiliates, such Indemnitor shall be subrogated to and shall stand
in the place of such Indemnitee as to any events or circumstances in respect
of which such Indemnitee may have any right, defense or claim relating to such
claim or demand against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such claim or
demand. Such Indemnitee shall cooperate with such Indemnitor in a reasonable
manner, and at the cost of such Indemnitor, in presenting any subrogated
right, defense or claim. 

11.10 Release. Except in the event of Fraud, each party hereto agrees that
none of the current or former officers, directors, managers, employees,
stockholders, members or Affiliates of any party hereto as of or prior to the
Closing Date (other than the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries, and Wheelock
Street Capital, L.L.C. solely with respect to those covenants contained in the
agreement entered into and delivered at Closing pursuant to Section
4.2(b)(xv)) shall have any liability or responsibility to the other parties
for (and each party hereby unconditionally releases such officers, directors,
managers, employees, stockholders, members and Affiliates from) any
obligations or liability:

(a) arising out of, or relating to, the organization, management, operation of
the businesses of any Company or any Company Subsidiary relating to any
matter, occurrence, action, omission or activity prior to the Closing Date;

(b) relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;

(c) arising out of or due to any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or
warranty or the breach of any covenant, undertaking or other agreement
contained in this Agreement, the Schedules and Exhibits hereto or in any
certificate contemplated hereby and delivered in connection herewith; or

(d) relating to any information (whether written or oral), documents or
materials furnished by or on behalf of the Companies and the Company
Subsidiaries, including the Evaluation Material.

11.11 No Recourse. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except in
the case of Fraud, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims
or causes of action for breach of this Agreement may only be made against the
entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto and no other Person
shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to
this Agreement for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) for
breach of this Agreement or in respect of any oral representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith.

11.12 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties
shall be entitled to seek an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties have
an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction. To the extent any party hereto brings any legal action, suit or
proceeding to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Termination
Date shall automatically be extended by (a) the amount of 

time during which such action, suit or proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20)
Business Days, or (b) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such action, suit or proceeding.
