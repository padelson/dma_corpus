audited consolidated balance sheets of the Corporation and the Corporation
Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Closing Date and the audited

of the Net Asset Amount as of the close of business on the Closing Date,
based on the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet and calculated in accordance
with the Pro Forma Calculation Principles (the " _Closing Date Net Asset
Amount_ ");

  



  

(ii) if, in the course of preparing the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet,
Sellers conclude that the Net Asset Amount as of September 30, 2004 was
greater than or less than $50,879,447, a revised version of the Pro Forma
Balance Sheets and a revised calculation of the Net Asset Amount as of
September 30, 2004 (the " _Revised Pro Forma Balance Sheets_ " and the "
_Revised September 30, 2004 Net Asset Amount,_" respectively) and a
reasonably detailed explanation for such revisions;

  



  

(iii) A true, correct and complete list of the Aged Inventory as of the close

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, for the
avoidance of doubt, no adjustment shall be made with respect to the Pre-
Closing Exempt Aged Inventory Amount, the Pre-Closing Non-Exempt Aged
Inventory Amount, the Closing Date Exempt Aged Inventory Amount or the
Closing Date Non-Exempt Inventory Amount to the extent such adjustment is
duplicative of any adjustment made in connection with the Estimated Closing
Date Balance Sheet and the Estimated Net Asset Amount (including any
writedown of inventory relating thereto) or the Final Closing Date Balance
Sheet and the Closing Date Net Asset Amount (including any writedown of
inventory relating thereto).

  



  

(b) Sellers agree that:

  



  

(i) except as set forth on _Schedule 4.5(b)(i)_, Sellers shall prepare the
GAAP version of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet so as to present fairly
in all material respects the combined financial position, assets and
liabilities of the Sweet Paper Entities as of the close of business on the
Closing Date;

  



  

(ii) Sellers shall prepare the GAAP version of the Final Closing Date Balance
Sheet so as to (A) be in accordance with the books and records of the Sweet
Paper Entities, (B) not reflect any material transactions that are not bona
fide transactions and (C) not contain any untrue information or disclosures
of a material nature or omit any fact necessary to make the information and
disclosures contained therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not materially misleading; and

  



  

(iii) Sellers shall prepare the pro forma version of the Final Closing Date
Balance Sheet so as to accurately reflect all adjustments to the GAAP version
of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet that are required by (A) items 1, 3,
4, 5, 6, 18 and 19 of the Pro Forma Calculation Principles and (B) item 21 of
the Pro Forma Calculation Principles as item 21 applies to items 3, 4, 5, 6
and 18 thereof. Sellers shall prepare the pro forma version of the Final
Closing Date Balance Sheet in good faith so as to accurately reflect, to the
greatest extent practicable, all adjustments to the GAAP version of the Final
Closing Date Balance Sheet that are required by all other Pro Forma
Calculation Principles.

  



  

25   

     
   

  



  

(c) In order to facilitate Sellers preparation of the Closing Date
Adjustment Materials, Purchaser shall make available to Sellers, Lundy
Shacter and any other Representative of Sellers (as applicable), without
unreasonable disruption of the normal business activities of Purchaser, the
Corporation, the Corporation Subsidiaries or the Business, (i) the
appropriate personnel and books and records of Purchaser relating to the
Business and (ii) the appropriate personnel and books and records of the
Corporation and the Corporation Subsidiaries. In furtherance of
the preceding sentence, until Sellers have delivered the Closing Date
Adjustment Materials in accordance with _Section 4.5(a)_, Purchaser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the employment of those
persons set forth on _Schedule 4.5(c)_, subject to the provisions of
_Section 7.17_. ** **All fees and expenses of Lundy Shacter and any other
Representative of Sellers relating to the audit or certification, as
applicable, of the Closing Date Adjustment Materials shall be borne solely by
Sellers.  Any Confidential Information supplied to Sellers by Purchaser to
enable Sellers to prepare or review the Closing Date Adjustment Materials
shall be maintained by Sellers in strict confidence and shall not be
disclosed to any Person (other than their accountants and other
representatives who need to know such information) or used by Sellers for any
purpose, except in each case in connection with the matters specifically
covered by this _Section 4.5_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such
restrictions shall not apply to (i) any information that becomes generally
available to the public after the Closing Date through no fault of any Seller
or any of its Representatives, (ii) any information that after the Closing is
legitimately received by any Seller or any of its Affiliates from a third
party (provided such third party is not known by any Seller or any of its
Affiliates to be bound by an obligation of confidentiality) or (iii) any
disclosure required by Law or any Governmental Authority, so long as notice
of such disclosure is given to Purchaser prior to making such disclosure and
Sellers cooperate with Purchaser as Purchaser may reasonably request to
resist such disclosure.

  



  

(d) At the time Purchaser delivers the Notice of Acceptance or the Notice
of Objections, as applicable, Purchaser shall notify the Seller
Representative of its designations with respect to the Exempt Aged Inventory
Threshold Amount. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Closing Date
Adjustment Materials from Sellers (but in no event, at Purchasers option,
prior to September 15, 2005), Purchaser shall either:

  



  

(i) deliver to the Seller Representative a written statement confirming that
no adjustments are proposed by Purchaser to the Closing Date Adjustment
Materials (a " _Notice of Acceptance_ "); or

  



  

(ii) deliver to the Seller Representative a written statement to the effect
that Purchaser objects to the Closing Date Adjustment Materials (a " _Notice
of Objections_ "), specifying the nature of such disagreement and the
adjustments that Purchaser seeks to the Closing Date Adjustment Materials.

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, if Sellers do not deliver a proposed
Revised September 30, 2004 Net Asset Amount pursuant to _Section
4.5(a)(ii)_, Purchaser shall be entitled to propose, in its Notice of
Objections, Revised Pro Forma Balance Sheets and a Revised September 30, 2004
Net Asset Amount if, in the course of reviewing the Closing Date Adjustment
Materials,

  



  

26   

     
   

  



  

Purchaser concludes that the Net Asset Amount as of September 30, 2004 was
greater than or less than $50,879,447.

  



  

(e) If Purchaser delivers to the Seller Representative a Notice of
Objections, and the parties cannot resolve any objections set forth in the
Notice of Objections (the " _Unresolved Adjustments_ ") within thirty (30)
days after the receipt by the Seller Representative of the Notice of
Objections, such Unresolved Adjustments shall be submitted for resolution to
KPMG LLP (which firm Purchaser represents and warrants has not been retained
by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, and Sellers represent and warrant has
not been retained by Sellers or any of their Affiliates, in each case, during
the two (2) years preceding the date of this Agreement) or another nationally
recognized independent accounting firm that is mutually agreeable to
Purchaser and the Seller Representative and was not retained by Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates or Sellers or any of their Affiliates during the two
(2) years preceding the date of this Agreement (the " _Accounting Firm_ ").
The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to resolve such Unresolved
Adjustments within thirty (30) days after its appointment. The scope of the
review by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to a determination of (i)
whether the portions of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet, the calculation
of the Closing Date Net Asset Amount, the calculation of the Revised
September 30, 2004 Net Asset Amount (if applicable), the Closing Date Aged
Inventory Report, the calculation of the Closing Date Exempt Aged Inventory
Amount and the calculation of the Closing Date Non-Exempt Inventory Amount
related to the Unresolved Adjustments were prepared in accordance with this
Agreement and (ii) based on its determinations of the matters described in
_clause (i)_ , a final calculation of the Closing Date Net Asset Amount, the
Revised September 30 Net Asset Amount (if applicable), the Closing Date
Exempt Aged Inventory Amount and the Closing Date Non-Exempt Inventory
Amount. The Accounting Firm is not to make or be asked to make any
determination other than as set forth in the previous sentence. The
resolution of such Unresolved Adjustments by the Accounting Firm shall be set
forth in a writing clearly labeled "Unresolved Adjustments Decision under the
Purchase Agreement" and shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties. The
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be apportioned between the
parties by the Accounting Firm based on the degree to which each partys
claims were unsuccessful and shall be paid by the parties in accordance with
such determination.  For example, if pursuant to this _Section
4.5,_ Purchaser submitted a Notice of Objections relating to an Unresolved
Adjustment of the Purchase Price in the amount of $100,000 and prevailed as
to $55,000 of such amount, then (A) Purchaser would bear forty-five percent
(45%) of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and (B) Sellers would
bear fifty-five percent (55%) of the fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein to the contrary, any
review by the Accounting Firm shall be a de novo review of the Unresolved
Adjustments; to the extent any Closing Date Adjustment Materials that are
relevant to the Unresolved Adjustments were to have been prepared "in good
faith," the Accounting Firm will determine the final adjustments to such
Closing Date Adjustment Materials in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied and, where applicable, in accordance with the Pro Forma Calculation
Principles (as opposed to determining simply whether such materials were made
in good faith).

  



  

27   

     
   

  



  

(f) The Closing Date Adjustment Materials shall become final and binding on
all parties upon the earliest of (i) the date that a Notice of Acceptance is
delivered to the Seller Representative pursuant to _Section 4.5(d)(i)_ (in
which case the final Closing Date Net Asset Amount, the final Revised
September 30, 2004 Net Asset Amount (if applicable), the Closing Date Aged
Inventory Report, the final Closing Date Exempt Aged Inventory Amount and the
final Closing Date Non-Exempt Inventory Amount shall be as set forth in the
Closing Date Adjustment Materials delivered pursuant to _Section 4.5(a)_),
(ii) the date that is one (1) day after the thirty (30) day review period
specified in _Section 4.5(d)_ has ended if no Notice of Objections has

Closing Date Net Asset Amount, the final Revised September 30, 2004 Net Asset
Amount (if applicable), the Closing Date Aged Inventory Report, the final
Closing Date Exempt Aged Inventory Amount and the final Closing Date Non-
Exempt Inventory Amount shall be as set forth in the Closing Date Adjustment
Materials delivered pursuant to _Section 4.5(a)_), (iii) the date of an
agreement in writing by Purchaser and the Seller Representative that the
Closing Date Adjustment Materials, together with any modifications thereto
agreed by Purchaser and the Seller Representative, are final and binding (in
which case the final Closing Date Net Asset Amount, the final Revised
September 30, 2004 Net Asset Amount (if applicable), the Closing Date Aged
Inventory Report, the final Closing Date Exempt Aged Inventory Amount and the
final Closing Date Non-Exempt Inventory Amount shall be as so agreed upon by
the parties) and (iv) the date on which the Accounting Firm finally resolves
in writing any Unresolved Adjustments (in which case the final Closing Date
Net Asset Amount, the final Revised September 30, 2004 Net Asset Amount (if
applicable), the Closing Date Aged Inventory Report, the final Closing Date
Exempt Aged Inventory Amount and/or the final Closing Date Non-Exempt
Inventory Amount, as applicable, shall be as determined by the Accounting
Firm pursuant to _Section 4.5(e)_).

Date Adjustment Materials and the date upon which the Closing Date
Adjustment Materials become final and binding in accordance with this
_Section 4.5_:

  



  

(i) promptly upon Purchasers request, (A) Sellers shall make available to

Materials, and (B) Sellers shall cause Lundy Shacter and any other
Representative of Sellers (as applicable) to make available to Purchaser and
its Representatives any work papers used or prepared by Lundy Shacter or such
other Representative in its preparation and audit or certification, as

4.5(d)(ii)_, promptly upon the Seller Representatives request, (A) Purchaser

Purchaser in identifying and quantifying the objections set forth in the
Notice of Objections, and such other documents as the Seller Representative
may reasonably request in connection with its review of the Notice of
Objections, and (B) Purchaser shall cause its Representatives to make
available to Sellers, Lundy Shacter and any other Representatives of Sellers
(as applicable) any work papers used or prepared by Purchasers
Representatives in identifying and quantifying the objections set forth in
the Notice of Objections.

  



  

(h) Within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the Closing Date
Adjustment Materials become final and binding in accordance with this
_Section 4.5_:

  



  

(i) if the Adjusted Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase

Purchase Price Increase Amount; or

  



  

(ii) if the Adjusted Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price
(such difference being hereinafter referred to as the " _Purchase Price
Reduction Amount_ "), then:

  



  

(A) if the Purchase Price Reduction Amount is less than the Purchase Price

Reduction Amount and (2) pay to the Seller Representative the amount of the
difference between the Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback Amount and the
Purchase Price Reduction Amount; and

amounts payable to Purchaser by Sellers pursuant to this _Section 4.5_.

7.16 _Termination of Shareholders  Agreement_. The Shareholders shall cause
the Shareholders Agreement to be terminated prior to the Closing.

  



  

7.17 _Employees_.

  



  

(a) With respect to Employees other than those employed by the Corporation or
any Corporation Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing, Purchaser
intends to make offers of employment to such individuals, subject to
Purchasers hiring policies and practices. Sellers shall be jointly and
severally liable for (and hereby expressly assume all liability of the
Business and the Corporation and the Corporation Subsidiaries for): (i) any
severance benefits or other payments to Employees that became payable prior
to the Closing or that become payable as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any payments that may become due to
any Employee on account of the sale of the Corporation or the Business, or on
account of the Employees termination of employment with a Sweet Paper Entity
at Closing, or on account of the fact that an Employee does not receive an
offer from Purchaser (except if such Employee does not receive an offer from
Purchaser due to an unlawful act of Purchaser), or receives, but does not
accept, an offer of employment from Purchaser, and (ii) any severance
benefits or other payments that become due (on account of an Employees
termination of employment with the Corporation, any Corporation Subsidiary or
Purchaser on or after the Closing Date) under any plan, program, arrangement,
agreement or understanding, or pursuant to any statement, formal or informal,
written or unwritten, of any Sweet Paper Entity, in existence (or made) at
any time prior to Closing. Purchaser agrees to: (A) provide any notice
required by or otherwise comply with the WARN Act, and any similar applicable
state or local Law addressing "plant closings" or "mass layoffs;" and (B)
indemnify and hold Sellers harmless with respect to any liability, damages,
fines, or costs (including reasonable attorneys fees), with respect to any
"plant closing" or "mass layoff" or similar event affecting Employees and
occurring in its entirety on or after the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) To the extent that Transferred Employees become eligible to participate
in Benefit Plans maintained by Purchaser or one of its Affiliates, and to the
extent permitted by applicable Laws and as agreed by insurers and any other
third parties providing

  



  

74   

     
   

  



  

benefits under such Benefit Plans, Purchaser will use reasonable efforts to
(i) cause its Benefit Plans (other than any severance plan) to recognize all
previous continuous service of Transferred Employees with Sweet Paper
Entities for the purpose of determining eligibility for and vesting of
benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under defined benefit
plans), (ii) provide credit for amounts paid toward deductibles, out-of-
pocket limits and co-payments during the calendar year 2005, (iii) cause such
Benefit Plans to recognize continuous service of Transferred Employees with
Sweet Paper Entities for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods or pre-
existing condition limitations, and (iv) provide, or cause an Affiliate to
provide, only in the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, no less
vacation and no less paid personal time off for each Transferred Employee
than he or she had a right, immediately before the Closing Date, to receive
during such calendar year, reduced by any vacation and personal time
previously incurred by the Transferred Employee during such calendar year.
 Purchaser shall cause its severance plans to provide that if a Transferred
Employee becomes eligible to participate in such a plan, then upon the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, if such Transferred Employee has been an
active employee, continuously from the Closing Date through such
third anniversary thereof, the plan shall recognize the Transferred
Employees previous service with the Sweet Paper Entities for purposes of
calculating any severance benefits that may thereafter become payable.

  



  

(c) The Employees set forth on _Schedule 7.17_ shall be eligible for
the incentives and other benefits or other compensation set forth on
_Schedule 7.17_.

  



  

(d) Purchaser shall either (i) maintain, through December 31, 2005, for the
benefit of the Transferred Employees, health, life and disability programs
identical or substantially similar to the health, life and disability
programs under which such employees are covered immediately prior to the
Closing Date, or (ii) provide the Transferred Employees with the opportunity
to participate in health, life and disability programs which Purchaser or one
of its affiliates maintains, subject to the ordinary terms and conditions of
those programs. Sellers shall remain responsible for, and hereby expressly
assume liability for (and the Business and Corporation shall have no
liability for) all costs and liabilities under any health, life
and disability programs maintained for all periods prior to the Closing
Date (including claims incurred prior to Closing and premiums for all periods
prior to Closing) and shall provide Purchaser with all documents, records
and information necessary for the administration of such health, life
and disability programs as Purchaser shall maintain, including all such
materials and information needed for compliance with the continuation
coverage requirements of section 4980B of the Code and section 601 of
ERISA and the portability and nondiscrimination requirements of sections 9801
and 9802 of the Code and sections 701-707 of ERISA. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this _Section 7.17(d)_, the parties hereto
agree that Purchaser shall be liable for any workers compensation claims
relating to events that occurred prior to the Closing if such claims are
adequately accrued on the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet.

  



  

(e) Within two weeks after entering into this Agreement, Sellers shall
provide Purchaser with certain files relating to Employees, including
personnel files, files maintained by Employees managers or supervisors,
benefits information (but without

  



  

75   

     
   

  



  

private information regarding Employees), drug testing results information,
and I-9 information (without attachments containing private or personal
information), except as prohibited by Law. After the Closing, Sellers shall
cause all other files pertaining to all Employees, including all medical
files and all workers compensation files, to be delivered to Purchaser as
the new employer of the Employees. The parties hereto agree that Purchaser
(i) shall be solely responsible for any claims that may arise as a result of
it obtaining any files (and the information contained therein) of Employees
prior to the Closing, and (ii) shall indemnify and hold Sellers harmless for
any liability or damages that may arise as a result of Purchasers obtaining
of or use of such files or information prior to the Closing.

  



  

(f) Prior to the Closing Date, (i) Sellers shall take all steps necessary to
ensure that a lump sum cash distribution is made to all participants in the
Sweet Paper Sales Corp. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan, as amended (the " _401(k)
Plan_ ") whose employment has terminated and whose account balances are below
$1,000; (ii) Sellers shall take all steps necessary to ensure that all
contributions for all periods prior to Closing, including any Matching
Contributions attributable to employee pre-tax or after-tax contributions for
periods prior to Closing, are made to the 401(k) Plan; and (iii) any entities
other than the Corporation that are currently participating employers in the
401(k) Plan shall withdraw from the 401(k) Plan at Closing.

  



  

(g) Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall enter into a binding Contract
with a third party vendor to file Forms 5500 through the Department of
Labors Delinquent Filer Voluntary Compliance Program for each year for each
plan with respect to which a Form 5500 should have been filed, but was not,
to prepare any plan documentation that Sellers together with such vendor
determines to be necessary to ensure that all plan documentation is
consistent with the Forms 5500 filed, and if necessary to negotiate with the
Department of Labor regarding any penalties or late fees associated with such
filing in the Delinquent Filer VCP or associated with the original failure to
file such Forms 5500. Sellers shall take all steps necessary to provide such
third party vendor with all information it requires to fulfill
its obligations under such Contract. The costs and fees under such Contract
and any other costs (including attorneys fees), liabilities, penalties and
excise taxes, associated with rectifying such failure to file, shall be paid
by Sellers and it shall be a Withdrawn Corporation Obligation or an Excluded
Obligation (as applicable). Further, Sellers shall remain responsible for,
and hereby expressly assume liability for (and the Business and Corporation
shall have no liability for) any and all costs, liabilities, penalties and
excise taxes arising in connection with the failure to file, or the late
filing of, any Form 5500 for any Benefit Plan, and all such assumed costs,
liabilities, penalties and excise taxes shall be Withdrawn Corporation
Obligations or Excluded Obligations (as applicable).

  



  

(h) Sellers shall take all steps to ensure that no employees of any Sweet
Paper Entity will have experienced an "employment loss" (as defined in the
WARN Act) during the ninety (90) calendar-day period immediately preceding
the Closing Date.

  



  

76   

     
   

  



  

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, no Employee shall be deemed to be a third
party beneficiary of, or have any rights with respect to, any provision set
forth in this _Section 7.17_.

  



  

7.18 _Insurance_. At Purchasers request, Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain certificates of insurance from any supplier that
has supplied products or services to any Sweet Paper Entity at any time
during the five (5) years preceding the date of this Agreement.

  



  

7.19 _Redistributors of America_. Sellers shall request that Redistributors
of America extend an offer to Purchaser providing for Purchaser, the
Corporation and the Corporation Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to be a
member of Redistributors of America from and after the Closing on
substantially the same terms and conditions of membership (including all
rights and privileges of membership) as other members of Redistributors of
America. For the avoidance of doubt, none of Purchaser, the Corporation or
any Corporation Subsidiary shall be obligated to accept any such membership
offer.

  



  

7.20 _No Additional Representations or Warranties_.  Purchaser acknowledges
that no Seller has made any representation, warranty or covenant, express or
implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the
Sweet Paper Entities, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or any
of its Related Agreements, and Purchaser further agrees that no Seller shall
have or be subject to any liability to Purchaser or any other Person
resulting from the distribution to Purchaser, or Purchasers use of, any
information that is not included in this Agreement or any of its Related
Agreements. EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH
IN THIS AGREEMENT, SELLERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, AT LAW, IN EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, IN RESPECT OF THE SWEET PAPER
ENTITIES OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR OPERATIONS,
INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO THE CONDITION,
MERCHANTABILITY, SUITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND SELLERS
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY SUCH REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY.

  



  

7.21 _Disclaimer Regarding Estimates and Projections_.  In connection with
Purchasers investigation of the Sweet Paper Entities, Purchaser may have
received from Sellers and the Sweet Paper Entities certain estimates,
forecasts, plans and financial projections of the Sweet Paper Entities.
Purchaser acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
make such estimates, forecasts, plans and projections, that Purchaser is
familiar with such uncertainties, that Purchaser is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, forecasts, plans and projections so furnished to it (including
the reasonableness of assumptions underlying such estimates, forecasts, plans
and projections), and that Purchaser shall have no claim against Sellers with
respect thereto. Accordingly, no Seller makes any representation or warranty
with respect to such estimates, forecasts, plans and projections (including
any such underlying assumptions). The parties hereto agree and acknowledge
that this _Section 7.21_ shall not apply to any estimates that are included
in any representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
Disclosure Schedules hereto (including any estimates that are included in any
representations or warranties contained in _Section 5.5_ or in any
_Schedule_ thereto.

  



  

77   

     
   

  



  

7.22 _Assignment of Certain Accounts Receivable_. In the event Purchaser
makes any claim hereunder with respect to a breach of those representations
and warranties set forth in _Section 5.13_ expressly relating to the
collectibility of accounts receivables, and Purchaser is compensated by
Sellers with respect to such claim (pursuant to an indemnification claim or
otherwise), Purchaser shall assign to a designee of the Seller Representative
any and all rights to the uncollected account in respect of which such
compensation is provided, and Sellers or such designee shall have all rights
to pursue collection of such account, including rights to institute
litigation to recover such account.

  



  

7.23 _Delivery of Accounting Materials_. Sellers shall cause Lundy Shacter
to deliver to Purchaser, at and as of the Closing: (a) all records
relating to the fixed asset schedules of each Sweet Paper Entity; (b) all
records relating to the prepaid insurance coverage of each Sweet Paper
Entity, and (c) all work product produced by Lundy Shacter in connection with

September 30 in each of 2002, 2003 and 2004 and (ii) the audited consolidated
financial statements of the Asset Sellers for the fiscal years ended December
31 in each of 2002, 2003 and 2004. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause Lundy Shacter to deliver to Purchaser, at and as of the
Closing, any other records at Purchasers request.

  



  

7.24 _Letter of Credit for Workers  Compensation Policy_.  Purchaser shall
cause a financial institution acceptable to The Travelers Indemnity Company
(" _Travelers_ ") to issue a letter of credit in the amount of $1,100,000 in
form and substance acceptable to Travelers to substitute for the Irrevocable
Standby Letter of Credit numbered SM203974 (the " _Wachovia Letter of Credit_
") issued in favor of Travelers by Wachovia Bank, National Association
immediately prior to the Closing.  Prior to and following the Closing,
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Sellers
to cause Travelers to return the Wachovia Letter of Credit to Wachovia Bank,
National Association.

7.26 _Cash_. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, the
Asset Sellers shall, and the Shareholders shall cause the Corporation and the
Corporation Subsidiaries to, use all commercially reasonable efforts to use

off in full as much Sweet Paper Debt as is practicable.

  



  

7.27 _Defeasance of Facility Mortgage Loan_.

  



  

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, Sellers and
Purchaser shall use all commercially reasonable efforts, at Sellers expense
(except for Purchasers legal expenses in connection with documenting and
negotiating the matters described in this _Section 7.27_), to effectuate a
defeasance of the Facility Mortgage Loan contemporaneous with the Closing
(the " _Defeasance_ "), such that, among other things, the Scheck Real
Property shall be released from the terms and conditions of the security
instruments relating to the Facility Mortgage Loan. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, no later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall

  



  

78   

     
   

  



  

deposit an amount required to effectuate the Defeasance, up to a maximum of
$20,500,000 in an escrow account (the " _Defeasance Escrow Account_ ")
maintained by an escrow agent or other third party acceptable to Purchaser
pursuant to escrow arrangements acceptable to Purchaser (such amount,
together with all interest earned thereon in the Defeasance Escrow Account,
shall be referred to herein as the " _Defeasance Deposit Amount_ ") and
pursuant to Defeasance terms, conditions and procedures acceptable to
Purchaser, including (i) assurances that the Defeasance Deposit Amount (less
any amounts payable therefrom in accordance with the terms of the escrow
agreement, which amounts Sellers agree to indemnify each Purchaser
Indemnified Party against) will be returned to Purchaser promptly if the
Defeasance does not occur, (ii) assurances that all documents pursuant to
which Scheck Family LLC, JEMS of Miami, Inc. or any Sweet Paper Entity is
obligated to GMAC with respect to the Facility Mortgage Loan and all
documents related to, or entered into in connection with the Facility
Mortgage Loan (the " _Facility Mortgage Loan Instruments_ ") have been
identified to Purchaser, (iii) assurances that, upon the consummation of the
Defeasance, any and all Liens held by GMAC or its Affiliates in connection
with the Facility Mortgage Loan on the Scheck Real Property shall be
terminated and released, and (iv) such other terms, conditions and procedures
as Purchaser reasonably determines are necessary. The parties hereto agree
that any amounts remaining in the Defeasance Escrow Account after the
Defeasance shall be disbursed to the Seller Representative. Sellers shall
indemnify and hold harmless each Purchaser Indemnified Party for any Losses
incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Party arising from fees and expenses
charged by Newman and Associates, GMAC or any other Person due to the fact that
the consummation of the Defeasance did not occur. If the consummation of the
Defeasance does not occur, and Purchaser receives an amount from the
Defeasance Escrow Account that is greater than the Defeasance Deposit Amount,
then Purchaser shall remit the amount of such difference to the
Seller Representative. If the Defeasance requires funds to be deposited in
the Defeasance Escrow Account in excess of $20,500,000, Sellers and Purchaser
shall endeavor to do what is necessary to accomplish the Defeasance;
_provided_  that in no event shall Purchaser be obligated to deposit more
than $20,500,000 into the Defeasance Escrow Account or otherwise take any
action adverse to Purchaser.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Corporation to be fully and irrevocably released from the Facility
Mortgage Loan Guaranty and the Facility Mortgage Loan Environmental
Indemnity, including by agreeing to enter into a replacement guaranty and
indemnity in favor of GMAC; provided, however, this covenant shall not apply
to the extent that the Facility Mortgage Loan Guaranty and the Facility
Mortgage Loan Environmental Indemnity will be terminated in accordance with
the Facility Mortgage Loan Instruments as a result of the Defeasance.

  



  

7.28 _New Scheck Real Property Lease_. From the date of this Agreement until
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and the Sellers shall cause Scheck Family
LLC and JEMS of Miami, Inc. to, document a lease agreement (the " _New Scheck
Real Property Lease_ ") pursuant to which the Corporation will lease the
Scheck Real Property from Scheck Family LLC and JEMS of Miami pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the Current Scheck Real Property Lease, as modified
by the terms and conditions set forth on _Exhibit 7.28_, which lease shall
be executed and

  



  

79   

     
   

  



  

delivered by Scheck Family LLC, JEMS of Miami, Inc. and the Corporation at
and as of the Closing. In connection with the foregoing, Sellers shall cause
Scheck Family LLC, JEMS of Miami, Inc. and the Corporation to terminate the
Current Scheck Real Property Lease effective as of the Closing, and the
parties hereto agree that the New Scheck Real Property Lease shall amend,
restate and supersede in its entirety the Current Scheck Real Property Lease.

Warranties made by any Seller) unless and until the aggregate amount of all
Losses incurred or suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties exceeds
$1,000,000 **** (the " _Basket Amount_ "), but in the event such Losses
exceed the Basket Amount, Sellers shall be liable and responsible to the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties for the full amount of such Losses (subject to
_Section 12.4(b)_), without reduction for the Basket Amount.

  



  

(b) _Maximum_. In no event shall Sellers aggregate liability pursuant to
_Sections 12.2(a)_ and _12.2(k)_ for Losses incurred or suffered by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties (other than with respect to any breach of or
inaccuracy in any of the Title and Authorization Warranties and the Tax

89   

     
   

  



  

inaccuracy in any of the Title and Authorization Warranties made by

(c) _Claims Based on Fraud or Misrepresentation that is Knowing and

_5.9(e)_ , _5.9(f)_ , _5.9(g)_ ,  _5.9(h)_ , _5.9(i)_ , _5.9(j)_ or _5.9(l)_
to the extent Purchaser, as of the date hereof, had knowledge of such
specific breach of or inaccuracy in such representation or warranty and of
the implication of such breach or inaccuracy.

  



  

12.5 _Materiality_. For purposes of _Sections 12.2_ and _12.4_ , the
representations and warranties contained in _Sections 5.5(a)(i)_ , _5.5(b)_
,  _5.5(c)_ , _5.5(d)_ , _5.5(e)_ , _5.5(f)_ , _5.5(g)_ and _5.12(a)_  shall
be deemed to have been made without any qualifications as to materiality and,
accordingly, for such purposes, all references therein to "material", "in all
material respects" and similar qualifications as to materiality shall
be deemed to be deleted therefrom (except where any such provision
requires disclosure of lists of items of a material nature or above a
specified threshold). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall not have
any liability pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)_ with respect to any
representation or warranty contained in _Sections 5.5(a)(i)_ , _5.5(b)_ ,
_5.5(c)_ , _5.5(d)_ , _5.5(e)_ , _5.5(f)_ ,  _5.5(g)_ , _5.12(a)_ , _5.18(b)_

related claims, the amount of all Losses incurred or suffered by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to such individual claim or series
of related claims exceeds $50,000 (but in the event such Losses exceed
$50,000, Sellers shall be liable and responsible to the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties for the full amount of such Losses) or (b) for all claims, the amount
of all Losses in the aggregate incurred or suffered by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties with respect to all such claims exceeds $350,000 (but in
the event such Losses exceed $350,000, Sellers shall be liable and
responsible to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for the full amount of such
Losses); _provided_ , _however_ , that even if a Loss threshold set forth in
_clause (a)_ or _(b)_ of this sentence is satisfied, Sellers obligation to
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any such Losses shall still
be subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 12.4_.

  



  

12.6 _Claims_. As soon as is reasonably practicable after becoming aware of a
claim for indemnification under this Agreement not involving a claim (or the
commencement of any suit, action or proceeding) of the type described in
_Section 12.7_ or _13.6_ , the Indemnitee shall give notice to the Indemnitor
of such claim; _provided_ , that the failure of the Indemnitee to give
notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations under this
_Article 12_ except to the extent (if any) that the Indemnitor shall have
been prejudiced thereby.  Subject to _Section 12.4_, if the Indemnitor does
not object in writing to such indemnification claim within thirty (30)
calendar days of receiving notice thereof, the Indemnitee shall be entitled
to recover promptly from the Indemnitor and the Indemnitor shall promptly pay
to the Indemnitee the amount of such claim (but such recovery shall not limit
the amount of any additional indemnification to which the

  



  

90   

     
   

  



  

Indemnitee may be entitled pursuant to _Section 12.2_ or _12.3_ ), and no
later objection by the Indemnitor shall be permitted. If within such thirty
(30) day period the Indemnitor agrees that it has an indemnification
obligation but objects that it is obligated to pay only a lesser amount, the
Indemnitee shall nevertheless be entitled to recover from the Indemnitor and
the Indemnitor shall promptly pay to the Indemnitee the lesser amount,
without prejudice to the Indemnitees claim for the difference.

  



  

12.7 _Notice of Third Party Claims; Assumption of Defense_. The Indemnitee
shall give notice as promptly as is reasonably practicable to the Indemnitor
of the assertion of any claim (or the commencement of any suit, action or
proceeding, by any Person not a party hereto) (other than by a Governmental
Authority with respect to Taxes, which shall be governed by _Section 13.6_)
in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement; _provided_
, that the failure of the Indemnitee to give notice shall not relieve
the Indemnitor of its obligations under this _Article 12_ except to
the extent (if any) that the Indemnitor shall have been prejudiced thereby.
The Indemnitor may, at its own expense, (a) participate in the defense of any
such claim, suit, action or proceeding and (b) upon notice to the Indemnitee
and the Indemnitors delivering to the Indemnitee a written agreement that
the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.2_ or
_12.3_ for all Losses arising out of such claim, suit, action or proceeding
and that the Indemnitor shall be liable for the entire amount of any Loss
resulting therefrom, at any time during the course of any such claim, suit,
action or proceeding, assume the defense thereof; _provided_ , that (i) the
Indemnitor shall provide written evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitee demonstrating that the Indemnitor has a sufficient amount of
assets for purposes of such assumption of defense and payment of Losses
arising out of such claim, suit, action or proceeding, (ii) the Indemnitors
counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee and (iii) the Indemnitor
shall thereafter consult with the Indemnitee upon the Indemnitees reasonable
request for such consultation from time to time with respect to such claim,
suit, action or proceeding. If the Indemnitor assumes such defense, the
Indemnitee shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnitor. If, however, the Indemnitee
reasonably determines in its judgment that representation by the Indemnitors
counsel of both the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee would present such counsel
with a conflict of interest, then such Indemnitee may employ separate counsel
to represent or defend it in any such claim, action, suit or proceeding and
the Indemnitor shall pay the fees and disbursements of such separate counsel.
Whether or not the Indemnitor chooses to defend or prosecute any such claim,
suit, action or proceeding, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the
defense or prosecution thereof, subject to the provisions of the following
sentence. In the event and for so long as any party hereto is actively
contesting or defending against any third-party action, suit, proceeding,
hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim or demand in connection with
(a) any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (b) any fact,
situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction prior to
the Closing Date involving the Sweet Paper Entities, each of the other
parties hereto shall cooperate with such party or its counsel in the contest
or defense, make available their personnel, and provide such testimony and
access to their books and records as shall be reasonably necessary in
connection with the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of
the contesting or defending party;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) no such
other party shall be required to take any action that would unduly disrupt
the operations of such other party and (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing,
the contesting or defending party shall be permitted to recover

  



  

91   

     
   

  



  

from the other parties any costs and expenses that it incurs in connection
with the contest or defense to the extent such costs and expenses constitute
Losses that are indemnifiable in accordance with the provisions of this
_Article 12_.

  



  

12.8 _Settlement or Compromise_. Any settlement or compromise made or caused
to be made by the Indemnitee or the Indemnitor, as the case may be, of any
such claim, suit, action or proceeding of the kind referred to in _Section
12.7_ shall also be binding upon the Indemnitor or the Indemnitee, as the
case may be, in the same manner as if a final judgment or decree had been
entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in the amount of such settlement
or compromise; _provided_ , that (a) no obligation, restriction or Loss shall
be imposed on the Indemnitee as a result of such settlement without its prior
written consent, and (b) the Indemnitee shall not compromise or settle any
claim, suit, action or proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

12.9 _Failure of Indemnitor to Act_. In the event that the Indemnitor does
not elect to assume the defense of any claim, suit, action or proceeding,
then any failure of the Indemnitee to defend or to participate in the defense
of any such claim, suit, action or proceeding or to cause the same to be
done, shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder.

  



  

12.10 _Irrevocable Standby Letters of Credit_. To secure Sellers
obligations under this Agreement, including any obligation to make
any indemnification payment to any Purchaser Indemnified Party under
this Agreement, Sellers shall obtain from Wachovia Bank, N.A., for
Purchasers benefit and at Sellers expense and for the account of Scheck
Investments, each of the $5 Million Letter of Credit and the $15 Million
Letter of Credit.

  



  

(a) _$5 Million Letter of Credit_.

  



  

(i) If any Purchaser Indemnified Party submits in good faith a notice to the
Seller Representative claiming that such Purchaser Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive any amount from any Seller under this Agreement,
including any indemnification payment under this Agreement, without limiting
such Purchaser Indemnified Partys rights to seek recovery through the $15
Million Letter of Credit or against any Seller directly, if Sellers fail to
pay to the Purchaser Indemnified Party the amount of such Purchaser
Indemnified Partys claim within ten (10) days after the Seller
Representative receives the Purchaser Indemnified Partys claim (or, if
sooner, on or after the third Business Day prior to the second anniversary of
the Closing Date), Purchaser shall be entitled to draw upon the $5 Million
Letter of Credit in the amount of such claim (or such lesser amount as is
then remaining under the $5 Million Letter of Credit).

  



  

(ii) If, in connection with the resolution of any claim (pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement or as otherwise agreed by the parties hereto) with
respect to which Purchaser drew any amount upon the $5 Million Letter of
Credit, it is determined that the Purchaser Indemnified Party is not entitled
to any portion of such amount (the " _Undeserved Portion_ "), Purchaser shall
pay to the Seller Representative, promptly upon the resolution of such claim,
an amount equivalent to the Undeserved Portion.

  



  

92   

     
   

  



  

(iii) The $5 Million Letter of Credit shall be maintained by Sellers for a
period of two (2) years from the Closing Date. If (A) Wachovia Bank, N.A.
notifies Scheck Investments or Purchaser that the $5 Million Letter of Credit
will expire on a date (the " _$5 Million LC Expiration Date_ ") that is prior
to the end of such two (2) year period and (B) Sellers have not either (1)
obtained and delivered to Purchaser a replacement letter of credit with terms
no less favorable to Purchaser than the $5 Million Letter of Credit from
another issuing bank reasonably acceptable to Purchaser on or before the
fifth Business Day prior to the $5 Million LC Expiration Date or (2) arranged
for the amount remaining under the $5 Million Letter of Credit to be placed
in an escrow account at a financial institution reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser pursuant to escrow arrangements reasonably acceptable to Purchaser,
then Purchaser, as beneficiary of the $5 Million Letter of Credit, may at any
time thereafter through the $5 Million LC Expiration Date unilaterally draw
the entirety of the remaining amount of the $5 Million Letter of Credit.

  



  

(b) _$15 Million Letter of Credit_.

  



  

(i) Without limiting any Purchaser Indemnified Partys rights to seek
recovery through the $5 Million Letter of Credit or against any Seller
directly, Purchaser shall be entitled to draw upon the $15 Million Letter of
Credit to collect such amounts owed to such Purchaser Indemnified Party under
this Agreement, including any indemnification payment under this Agreement
(or such lesser amount as is then remaining under the $15 Million Letter of
Credit), if Sellers fail to pay to the Purchaser Indemnified Party the amount
of such Purchaser Indemnified Partys claim within ten (10) days after any of
the following conditions is satisfied: (A) the claim of the Purchaser
Indemnified Party is resolved by Purchaser and the Seller Representative
pursuant to a written agreement executed and delivered by Purchaser and the
Seller Representative, (B) the claim of the Purchaser Indemnified Party is
resolved by a judgment (whether appealable or non-appealable) of any state or
federal court located within the County of New York, in the State of New York
or (C) the claim of the Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to an
Unresolved Adjustment is resolved by a written decision of the Accounting
Firm pursuant to _Section 4.5(e)_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
condition set forth in _clause (C)_ shall be deemed to be satisfied only if
Sellers are obligated to pay any amount to Purchaser pursuant to _Section
4.5(h)(ii)(B)_. If Sellers fail to pay to the Purchaser Indemnified Party the
amount of the Purchaser Indemnified Partys claim within ten (10) days after
any of the conditions set forth in _clauses (A)_ , _(B)_  or _(C)_ are
satisfied, then promptly after such ten (10) day period, Scheck Investments
shall execute the certificate, in the form of Attachment B to the $15 Million
Letter of Credit, for the drawing of amounts under the $15 Million Letter of
Credit.

  



  

(ii) On the date that is one (1) year after the Closing Date, the stated
amount of the $15 Million Letter of Credit shall be reduced by an amount
equivalent to (A) $5,000,000 _minus_ (B) any amounts theretofore drawn upon
the $5 Million Letter of Credit by Purchaser _minus_ (C) any amounts
theretofore

  



  

93   

     
   

  



  

drawn upon the $15 Million Letter of Credit by Purchaser _minus_ (D) any
amounts necessary to satisfy any unresolved claims theretofore asserted by
any Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to _Article 12_, including for any
breach of _Section 4.5(h)(ii)_ (it being understood that there shall be no
reduction of the stated amount of the $15 Million Letter of Credit if the
amount set forth in the preceding sentence is zero or a negative number).

  



  

(iii) Subject to the provisions of _Section 12.10(b)(ii)_, the $15 Million
Letter of Credit shall be maintained by Sellers for a period of two (2) years
from the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , if during such two (2)
year period any Purchaser Indemnified Party asserts a claim pursuant to
_Article 12_, including for any breach of _Section 4.5(h)(ii)_, that is
not resolved at the time the $15 Million Letter of Credit would otherwise
expire (such claims are collectively referred to hereinafter as the "
_Unresolved Claims_ "), then the term of the $15 Million Letter of Credit
shall be extended for additional one (1) year periods with respect to an
amount that is necessary to satisfy the Unresolved Claims (the " _Unresolved
Claims Amount_ ") until such Unresolved Claims are resolved pursuant to one
of _clauses (A)_ ,  _(B)_ or _(C)_ of _Section 12.10(b)(i)_. In order for
the term of the $15 Million Letter of Credit to be extended with respect to
the Unresolved Claims Amount beyond the initial two (2) year period or beyond
any additional one (1) year period thereafter, Purchaser shall submit to
Wachovia Bank, N.A. a certificate requesting that the term of the $15 Million
Letter of Credit be extended with respect to the Unresolved Claims Amount (in
accordance with the terms of the $15 Million Letter of Credit). If,
after Purchaser submits to Wachovia Bank, N.A. such a certificate, (A)
Wachovia Bank, N.A. does not provide any response to Purchaser within ten
(10) days of receiving Purchasers certificate or Wachovia Bank, N.A.
notifies Purchaser within ten (10) days of receiving Purchasers certificate
that Wachovia Bank, N.A. will not extend the $15 Million Letter of Credit
with respect to the Unresolved Claims Amount such that the $15 Million Letter
of Credit would expire on a date (the " _$15 Million LC Expiration Date_ ")
that is prior to the date on which the $15 Million Letter of Credit would
otherwise expire pursuant to this _Section 12.10(b)(iii)_ and (B) Sellers
have not either (1) obtained and delivered to Purchaser a replacement letter
of credit with respect to the Unresolved Claims Amount with terms no less
favorable to Purchaser than the $15 Million Letter of Credit from another
issuing bank reasonably acceptable to Purchaser on or before the fifth
Business Day prior to $15 Million LC Expiration Date or (2) arranged for a
portion of the remaining amount of the $15 Million Letter of Credit
equivalent to the Unresolved Claims Amount to be placed in an escrow account
at a financial institution reasonably acceptable to Purchaser pursuant to
escrow arrangements reasonably acceptable to Purchaser on or before the fifth
Business Day prior to $15 Million LC Expiration Date, then Purchaser, as
beneficiary of the $15 Million Letter of Credit, may at any time thereafter
through such expiration date unilaterally draw that portion of the remaining
amount of the $15 Million Letter of Credit equivalent to the Unresolved
Claims Amount.

  



  

94   

     
   

  



  

(iv) The parties hereto agree that if Wachovia Bank, N.A. requires that any
provisions of the $15 Million Letter of Credit (as attached hereto at
_Exhibit 1.1(f)_ ) be revised in order for Wachovia Bank, N.A. to issue such
letter of credit, then the parties hereto shall cooperate in good faith to
agree with Wachovia Bank, N.A. upon such revisions that (A) are not
materially different from the provisions of _Exhibit 1.1(f)_ and (B) do not
adversely affect Purchaser.

  



  

12.11 _Purchase Price Adjustments_. Any amounts payable under _Section
12.2_ or _Section 12.3_ shall be treated by Purchaser and Sellers as an
adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price.

  



  

12.12 _Consequential Damages_. In no event shall any party hereto be liable
hereunder for any special, incidental, punitive **,** exemplary **** or
consequential damages, other than any such damages payable by Purchaser or
any Seller to an unaffiliated third party.

  



  

12.13 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as provided by _Section 11.2_ or _Article
13_, the indemnification rights provided in this _Article 12_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the parties hereto arising out of or relating to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not (a) prohibit any party hereto
from seeking specific performance or other equitable relief with respect to
its rights under this Agreement (including those rights of Purchaser pursuant
to _Sections 7.9_ , _7.11_ , _14.3_ and _15.13_ ) or (b) apply with
respect to the Boston Real Property Lease, the Current Scheck Real Property
Lease, the Scheck Lease Amendment, the Side Letter or the Sweet
Distribution Sublease. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything else set
forth in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall in no way
preclude any party hereto from bringing, and exercising all other rights
associated with, a claim of fraud or misrepresentation that is knowing and
intentional against any other party hereto or any other Person.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 13.**

  

 ** **

  

 **TAX MATTERS**

  

 ** **

  

13.1 _Filing of Tax Returns_.

  



  

(a) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns for the Corporation and the Corporation Subsidiaries
for all (i) taxable years beginning prior to the Closing Date and ending
after the Closing Date and (ii) taxable years beginning after the Closing
Date. Purchaser shall provide to the Seller Representative for review and
comment each Tax Return described in _clause (i)_ of this _Section 13.1(a)_
(a " _Straddle Return_ ") at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date
for filing such return (or, if required to be filed within fifteen (15) days
of the Closing Date, as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Closing).  Prior to the due date for filing a Straddle Return, Sellers shall
pay to Purchaser an amount of cash equal to the amount of Taxes shown as due
on the Straddle Return to the extent of Sellers liability for such Taxes
pursuant to _Section 13.4_.

  



  

(b) Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns for the
Corporation and the Corporation Subsidiaries for all taxable years ending on
or prior to

  



  

95   

     
   

  



  

the Closing Date that are to be filed by the Corporation or a Corporation
Subsidiary after the Closing Date. Sellers shall provide to Purchaser for
review and comment each Tax Return described in this _Section 13.1(b)_ (a "
_Section 13.1(b) Return_") at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date
for filing such return (or, if required to be filed within fifteen (15) days
of the Closing Date, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing).
Prior to the due date for filing a Section 13.1(b) Return, Sellers shall pay
to Purchaser an amount of cash equal to the amount of Taxes shown as due on
the Section 13.1(b) Return to the extent of Sellers liability for such Taxes
pursuant to _Section 13.4_.

  



  

13.2 _Proration of Taxes_. For purposes of allocating liability for Taxes
under _Section 13.4_, in the case of any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), (a) real,
personal and intangible property Taxes (" _Property Taxes_ ") of the
Corporation and the Corporation Subsidiaries allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period; and (b) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) of the
Corporation and the Corporation Subsidiaries allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the close of
business on the Closing Date, provided that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the
Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the
number of days in each period.

  



  

13.3 _Transfer Taxes_. Sellers shall be responsible for all sales, use and
transfer Taxes, including any value added, stock transfer, gross receipts,
stamp duty and real, personal, or intangible property transfer Taxes, arising
from the transactions contemplated hereby or in the Related Agreements,
including any interest or penalties in respect thereof.

  



  

13.4 _Tax Indemnification_. Except to the extent any such Taxes were taken
into account in computing the adjustments pursuant to _Article 4_, from and
after the Closing Date, Sellers, jointly and severally, shall protect,
defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, the Corporation and the
Corporation Subsidiaries from and against (a) any and all Taxes of the
Corporation or the Corporation Subsidiaries attributable to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period (other than Taxes relating to the Withdrawn Corporation Assets);
(b) all Taxes of any Person for which the Corporation or a Corporation
Subsidiary may be liable under Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
Contract, or otherwise; (c) all Transfer Taxes allocated to Sellers under
_Section 13.3_; (d) all Taxes relating to or arising from the Withdrawn
Corporation Assets; and (e) any and all amounts payable (including interest,
penalties and/or additional payments relating to any failure to comply) under
any unclaimed property or escheat Laws for the Corporation or the Corporation
Subsidiaries relating to any property that was held at any point by, or
otherwise attributable to, the Corporation or a Corporation Subsidiary in a
Pre-Closing Tax Period. If Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Corporation or any Corporation Subsidiary) receives after the Closing Date
any net overpayments or net refunds of Taxes of the Corporation or any
Corporation Subsidiary with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Purchaser
shall pay or cause to be paid to Sellers the amount of such net overpayments
or net refunds so received by Purchaser or its

  



  

96   

     
   

  



  

Affiliates, except to the extent any such net overpayments or net refunds
were taken into account in computing the adjustments pursuant to _Article
4_.

  



  

13.5 _Cooperation/Retention of Records_. After the Closing, upon reasonable
written notice, Purchaser and Sellers shall furnish or cause to be furnished
to each other, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance
(to the extent within the control of such party) relating to the Corporation
and the Corporation Subsidiaries (including access to books and records) as
is reasonably requested for the filing of all Tax Returns, and making of an
election related to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Governmental
Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding
related to any Tax Return.  For a period of seven (7) years after the Closing
Date, (a) Purchaser shall retain (i) all Tax records relating to the
Corporation or any Corporation Subsidiary that are in the possession of the
Corporation or any Corporation Subsidiary as of the Closing and (ii) all Tax
records relating to any Asset Seller that are included in the Transferred
Group Information and Records and are in the possession of Purchaser
immediately after the Closing, and (b) Purchaser shall promptly make
available to Sellers the aforementioned materials upon the reasonable request
of Sellers.

  



  

13.6 _Procedures Relating to Tax Claims_.

  



  

(a) After the Closing, each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller
Representative, on the other hand (the " _Recipient_ "), shall promptly
notify the other party in writing upon receipt by the Recipient or any of its
Affiliates (including in the case of the Seller Representative, Sellers) of
any written notice of any pending or threatened audit or assessment, suit,
proposed adjustment, deficiency, dispute, administrative  judicial
proceeding or other similar Claim (" _Tax Claim_ ") received by the Recipient
from any Governmental Authority or any other party with respect to Losses for
which any of  Sellers may be liable under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a failure by the Recipient to give such notice shall not
affect the rights of the Recipient or any of its Affiliates to
indemnification under _Article 12_ or _Article 13_ unless Purchaser or
Sellers (as applicable) is or are materially adversely prejudiced as a
consequence of such failure.

  



  

(b) The Seller Representative shall be responsible for the conduct and
control of any federal income and California sales Tax Claim relating to a
taxable year of the Corporation or any Corporation Subsidiary ending on or
before the Closing Date. The Seller Representative may elect to control any
other Tax Claim involving any asserted liability with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period of the Corporation or any Corporation Subsidiary (" _Other
Tax Claim_ ").  If the Seller Representative desires to elect to control any
Other Tax Claim, the Seller Representative shall within ten (10) calendar
days of receipt of notice of such Other Tax Claim notify Purchaser in writing
of its intent to do so.

  



  

(c) To the extent the Seller Representative controls a Tax Claim (including
an Other Tax Claim), the Seller Representative may control the conduct of the
Tax Claim through counsel of the Sellers own choosing and at Sellers sole
expense and shall have all rights to settle, compromise  and/or concede such
asserted liability and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate and shall cause
the Corporation and the Corporation Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller Representative shall not settle,

  



  

97   

     
   

  



  

compromise and/or concede such asserted liability without the written consent
of Purchaser (whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) if such
settlement, compromise or concession could increase the Tax liability of any
of Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates), the Corporation or any Corporation
Subsidiary for any other taxable period; _provided_ , _further_ , the Seller
Representative shall permit Purchaser, if Purchaser so elects, to participate
in the conduct of any such Tax Claim and shall otherwise keep Purchaser
reasonably informed of any material developments and events relating to such
Tax Claim. If the Seller Representative does not elect to control an Other
Tax Claim pursuant to this _Section 13.6(b)_ or, after assuming control of
any Tax Claim, the Seller Representative fails to reasonably defend against
such Tax Claim, Purchaser, or its Affiliates may, without affecting
Purchasers or any other Indemnitees rights to indemnification under
_Article 12_ and _Article 13_, assume sole control of the defense of such
Tax Claim (at Sellers expense).

  



  

(d) With respect to any Tax Claim that involves any Straddle Period,
Purchaser shall notify the Seller Representative of such Tax Claim and
Purchaser shall control the conduct of any such Tax Claim, through counsel of
Purchasers own choosing with participation by the Seller Representative (at
Sellers expense) and Purchaser shall have all rights to settle, compromise
and/or concede such Tax Claim with the consent of Sellers (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

14.1 _Non-Competition Agreement_.

  



  

(a) Each Seller agrees that from and after the Closing Date until the later

date that is five (5) years **** after the termination of such Sellers
service as an officer or employee of or consultant to Purchaser, the

any of its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly:

  



  

(i) engage in, or own any interest in, control, advise, manage, operate,

(v) make any untrue statement to any third party regarding Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates (including the Corporation or any Corporation Subsidiary)
in connection with the Restricted Business; or

  



  

(vi) employ, solicit for employment or encourage to leave his or her
employment, on its behalf or on behalf of any other Person, any individual
who was during the two (2) year period prior to such employment, solicitation
or encouragement or is an officer or employee of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Corporation or any Corporation Subsidiary) involved
in the Restricted Business as conducted by Purchaser and its Affiliates after
the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein or otherwise to the contrary:

  



  

(i) each Seller shall be permitted to, either directly or indirectly, own up
to an aggregate of one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of any class of
capital stock of any Person listed on a national securities exchange or
quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation
System or over-the-counter;

  



  

(ii) each of Michael Scheck, Raquel Scheck, Jeffrey Scheck, Steven Scheck,

engage solely in the Sweet Distribution Business and does not expand into
other aspects of the Restricted Business;

  



  

(iv) each Shareholder shall be permitted to serve as a manager or director of
Sweet Distribution so long as Sweet Distribution continues to engage solely
in the Sweet Distribution Business and does not expand into other aspects of

of, is acting as a consultant to, or is rendering services for Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates in connection with the Restricted Business, such
Shareholder shall not participate, either directly or indirectly, in the day-
to-day operations of Sweet Distribution (which day-to-day operations shall
include making decisions regarding which stock keeping units will be sold, to
which customers such stock keeping units will be sold, and from which
suppliers such stock keeping units will be purchased),

  



  

99   

     
   

  



  

and (B) in any event, each Shareholder shall at all times adhere to the
provisions of _Section 7.9_;

  



  

(v) each Affiliate of a Shareholder that is set forth on _Schedule

(vi) each Shareholder shall comply with the provisions set forth in _Schedule
14.1(b)(vi)_.

  



  

14.2 _Reasonableness of Covenants_. _ _Purchaser and Sellers have
independently consulted with their respective counsel and after such
consultation agree that the covenants set forth in _Section 14.1_ and in
_Schedule 14.1(b)(vi)_ (each a " _Non-Competition Covenant_ " and
collectively the " _Non-Competition Covenants_ "), including the time
limitation, geographic area and scope of activity of such Non-Competition
Covenants, are appropriate and reasonable when considered in light of the
nature and extent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Related Agreements.  Each Seller further agrees and acknowledges that (a) the
Non-Competition Covenants are of the essence of this Agreement, (b) Purchaser
is relying upon each Sellers agreements in this _Article 14_ and, but for
the agreement of each Seller to comply with the Non-Competition
Covenants, Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement or any of the
Related Agreements, and (c) each Non-Competition Covenant is reasonable and
necessary to protect and preserve the interests and properties of Purchaser.

  



  

14.3 _Specific Performance_. Each Seller recognizes and affirms that in the
event of breach by it of any of the provisions of this _Article 14_, money
damages would be inadequate and Purchaser would have no adequate remedy at
law. Accordingly, each Seller agrees that Purchaser shall have the right, in
addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to enforce
its rights and each Sellers obligations under this _Article 14_ not only by
an action or actions for damages, but also by an action or actions for
specific performance, injunction and/or other equitable relief in order to
enforce or prevent any violations (whether anticipatory, continuing or
future) of the provisions of this _Article 14_. In the event of a breach or
violation by any Seller of any of the provisions of this _Article 14_, the
Non-Competition Period shall be extended as to such individual by a
period equal to (a) the length of the breach or violation of this _Article
14_ plus (b) the length of any court proceedings necessary to stop such
breach or violation. If a bond is required to be posted in order for
Purchaser to secure an injunction, the parties agree that such bond need not
exceed the sum of $1,000.

  



  

14.4 _Severability_. If at any time any of the provisions of this _Article
14_ shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable by reason of being
vague or unreasonable as to duration, area or scope of activity, or
otherwise, then this  _Article 14_ shall be considered divisible (with the
other provisions to remain in full force and effect) and the invalid or
unenforceable provisions shall become and be deemed to be immediately amended
to include only such maximum time limitation, geographic area, scope of
activity and other restrictions, as shall be determined to be reasonable and
enforceable by the court or other body having jurisdiction over the matter,
and each Seller expressly agrees that this Agreement, as so amended, shall be
valid and binding as though any invalid or unenforceable provision had not
been included herein.

  



  

100   

     
   

  



  

14.5 _No Limitation of Other Provisions_. The provisions of this _Article
14_ shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other provisions
contained in any other agreement restricting competition by any Seller.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 15.**

  

 ** **

  

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

  

 ** **

  

15.1 _Expenses_. Except as provided in _Sections 7.4(a)_  and _13.3_ , each
party hereto shall bear its own fees and expenses with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

15.2 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented but
only in writing signed by Purchaser and each Seller.

  



  

15.3 _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be
given hereunder by a party hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to

party providing notice by an overnight delivery service (including United
Parcel Service or Federal Express) or (c) three (3) Business Days after being

or to such other individual or address as a party hereto may designate for
itself by notice given as herein provided.

  



  

15.4 _Effect of Investigation_. Any due diligence review, audit or other
investigation or inquiry undertaken or performed by or on behalf of Purchaser
shall not limit, qualify, modify or amend the representations, warranties,
covenants or obligations of (including indemnities by) any Seller made or
undertaken pursuant to this Agreement or any of their Related Agreements,
irrespective of the knowledge and information received (or that should have
been received) therefrom by Purchaser.

  



  

15.5 _Payments in Dollars_. Except as otherwise provided herein or in a
Related Agreement, all payments pursuant hereto shall be made by wire
transfer in U.S. Dollars in same day or immediately available funds.

  



  

15.6 _Waivers_. The failure of a party hereto at any time or times to require
performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right at a
later time to enforce the same.  No waiver by a party of any condition or of
any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing, and no waiver in any one
or more instances shall be deemed to be a further or continuing waiver of any
such condition or breach in other instances or a waiver of any other
condition or breach of any other term, covenant, representation or warranty.

  



  

15.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

  



  

15.8 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, heirs
and legal representatives; _provided_ , that no assignment of any rights or
obligations hereunder shall be made by any Seller to any Person without the
written consent of Purchaser and no assignment of any rights or obligations
hereunder shall be made by Purchaser to any Person without the written
consent of the Seller Representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser shall, without the obligation to obtain the written consent of any
other party hereto (including the Seller Representative), be entitled to
assign this Agreement or all or any part of its rights or obligations
hereunder to any direct or

  



  

102   

     
   

  



  

indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent; _provided_ , that such assignment
shall not relieve Purchaser of any of its obligations hereunder. If any party
hereto assigns any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 15.8_, the parties hereto shall, as appropriate, modify the
exhibits and other documents to be delivered at or prior to the Closing to
either add the assignee as a party to such document or substitute the
assignee for the assignor as the party to such document.

  



  

15.9 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except where expressly provided
otherwise in this Agreement, this Agreement is solely for the benefit of the
parties hereto and, to the extent provided herein, their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives, and
no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to confer upon other third
parties any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other
right.

  



  

15.10 _Publicity_. Prior to the Closing Date, no public announcement or other
publicity regarding the existence of this Agreement or its contents or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be made by Purchaser, any Seller or
any of its respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
representatives or agents, without the prior written agreement of Purchaser
and the Seller Representative, in any case, as to form, content, timing and
manner of distribution or publication; _provided_ , that nothing in this
_Section 15.10_ shall prevent (a) Parent from filing a Form 8-K with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or publicly issuing a press release,
in each case, with respect to this Agreement or its contents or the
transactions contemplated hereby (the contents of which Form 8-K and press
release shall be determined by Parent and its Affiliates in their sole
discretion) or (b) any party from (i) making any public announcement required
by Law or the rules of any stock exchange, (ii) discussing this Agreement or
its contents or the transactions contemplated hereby with those Persons whose
approval, agreement or opinion, as the case may be, is required for
consummation of such particular transaction or transactions or (iii)
enforcing its rights hereunder.

  



  

15.11 _Further Assurances_. Upon the reasonable request of Purchaser, each
Seller shall on and after the Closing Date execute and deliver to Purchaser
such other documents, releases, assignments and other instruments as may be
required to effectuate completely the transfer and assignment to Purchaser
of, and to vest fully in Purchaser title to, the Shares or the Assets, and to
otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

15.12 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality or enforceability
of the other provisions hereof shall not be affected thereby, and there shall
be deemed substituted for the provision at issue a valid, legal and
enforceable provision as similar as possible to the provision at issue.

  



  

15.13 _Specific Performance_. Each party recognizes and affirms that in the
event of breach by him or it of any of the provisions of _Section 7.9_ or
_Section 7.11_ money damages would be inadequate and the other parties would
have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, each party agrees that the
other parties shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and
remedies existing in their favor, to enforce their respective rights and the
breaching partys obligations under _Section 7.9_ and _Section 7.11_ not
only by an action or actions for damages, but also by an action or
actions for specific performance, injunction and/or other equitable relief in
order to enforce or prevent any violations (whether anticipatory, continuing
or future) of the

  



  

103   

     
   

  



  

provisions of _Section 7.9_ or _Section 7.11_. If a bond is required to be
posted in order for any party to secure an injunction, the parties agree that
such bond need not exceed the sum of $1,000.

  



  

15.14 _Remedies Cumulative_. The remedies provided in this Agreement shall
be cumulative and shall not preclude the assertion or exercise of any other
rights or remedies available by Law, in equity or otherwise.

  



  

15.15 _Entire Understanding_. This Agreement and the Related Agreements set
forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and supersede any and all
prior agreements, arrangements and understandings among the parties relating
to the subject matter hereof, including, (a) the letter agreement, dated
January 7, 2005, between Lagasse, Inc., Group and the Shareholders and (b)
the Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of January 19,
2004, between Purchaser and the Corporation, but excluding the 3-Party Mutual
Nondisclosure Agreement, dated as of October 7, 2004, among Purchaser, the
Corporation and Bearing Point Inc. (the " _3-Party Mutual Nondisclosure
Agreement_ "), which agreement remains in full force and effect.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that,
pursuant to the provisions of the 3-Party Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement,
from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall be released from its obligations
under the 3-Party Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement.

  



  

15.16 _Acknowledgment of each Seller_. Each Seller represents to Purchaser
that it is knowledgeable and sophisticated as to business matters, including
the subject matter of this Agreement, that such Seller has read this
Agreement and that it understands its terms. Each Seller acknowledges that,
prior to assenting to the terms of this Agreement, it has been given a
reasonable time to review it, to consult with counsel of his or its choice
and to negotiate at arms-length with Purchaser as to its contents.  Each
Seller and Purchaser agree that the language used in this Agreement is the
language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and that no
rule of strict construction is to be applied against any Seller or Purchaser.

  



  

15.17 _Seller Representative_.

  



  

(a) _Appointment_. Each Seller hereby irrevocably authorizes and appoints
Jeffrey Scheck as its true and lawful attorney and representative (the "
_Seller Representative_ ") with full power and authority to take any and all
actions and execute any and all documents specified in this Agreement or any
Related Agreement as being within the authority of the Seller Representative.
Jeffrey Scheck hereby accepts his appointment as the Seller Representative
and agrees to perform all of the duties of the Seller Representative
hereunder. If the Seller Representative shall die or become incapacitated,
Sellers shall promptly appoint a successor Person to act as the Seller
Representative.

  



  

(b) __Authority and Duties__. Each Seller, by its execution of this
Agreement, hereby authorizes and instructs the Seller Representative, and
constitutes the Seller Representative as agent for and on behalf of such
Seller, (i) to give and receive any and all notices required to be given
under this Agreement to or by the Seller Representative, (ii) to take any
and all action in connection with the defense, payment or settlement of

  



  

104   

     
   

  



  

any claims to indemnify, hold harmless or reimburse any Purchaser Indemnified
Parties pursuant to _Article 12_ or _Article 13_ (including any claims by
Purchaser to retain any or all of the Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback
Amount) (iii) to take any and all additional action as is contemplated to be
taken by the Seller Representative by the terms of this Agreement, and (iv)
to take any and all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate in
the judgment of the Seller Representative for the accomplishment of any of
the foregoing. Any decision or action by the Seller Representative
hereunder, shall constitute a decision or action of all Sellers and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon each Seller. No Seller shall have the right
to object to, dissent from, protest or otherwise contest the same.

  



  

(c) _Reliance_. Each Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on (i) the Seller Representative as the sole representative
of Sellers with respect to the duties set forth in _Section 15.17(b)_ and
(ii) any decision or act of the Seller Representative required, permitted or
contemplated to be taken by the Seller Representative hereunder. Each
Purchaser Indemnified Party is hereby relieved from any liability to any
Person for any acts done by any of them in accordance with any instructions,
decisions or acts of the Seller Representative. Purchaser shall be entitled
to treat as genuine, and as the document it purports to be, any letter, paper
or other document provided to it by or on behalf of the
Seller Representative, and reasonably believed by Purchaser to be genuine and
to have been signed and presented by the proper Person or Persons.

  



  

15.18 _Joint and Several Liability of Sellers_. Each Seller hereby agrees
that it shall be jointly and severally liable with the other Sellers for any
and all representations, warranties, covenants and other obligations of any
Seller set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

15.19 _Applicable Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
and enforced in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of New York
without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

  



  

15.20 _Jurisdiction of Disputes; Waiver of Jury Trial_.  In the event any
party to this Agreement commences any litigation, proceeding or other legal
action in connection with or relating to this Agreement or any matters
described or contemplated herein, the parties to this Agreement hereby (a)

brought exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction located within the
County of New York, in the State of New York, whether a state or federal
court; (b) agree that in connection with any such litigation, proceeding or
action, such parties will consent and submit to personal jurisdiction in any
such court described in _clause (a)_ of this _Section 15.20_ and to service
of process upon them in accordance with the rules and statutes governing
service of process; (c) agree to waive to the full extent permitted by law
any objection that they may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such
litigation, proceeding or action in any such court or that any
such litigation, proceeding or action was brought in an inconvenient forum;
(d) designate, appoint and direct CT Corporation System as their authorized
agent to receive on their behalf service of any and all process and documents
in any legal proceeding in the State of New

York; (e) agree to notify the other parties to this Agreement immediately if
such agent shall refuse to act, or be prevented from acting, as agent and, in
such event, promptly to designate another agent in the State of New York to
serve in place of such agent and deliver to the other parties written
evidence of such substitute agents acceptance of such designation; (f) agree
as an alternative method of service to service of process in any litigation,
proceeding or action by mailing of copies thereof to the parties at their
addresses set forth in _Section 15.3_; (g) agree that any service made as
provided herein shall be effective and binding service in every respect; and
(h) agree that nothing herein shall affect the rights of any party to effect
service of process in any other manner permitted by Law. EACH PARTY
HERETO WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY DISPUTE IN CONNECTION WITH
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY MATTERS DESCRIBED OR CONTEMPLATED
HEREIN, AND AGREES TO TAKE ANY AND ALL ACTION NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE TO
