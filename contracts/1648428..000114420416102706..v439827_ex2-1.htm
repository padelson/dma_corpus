2.06 Purchase Price Adjustment Procedures.

  



  

(a) Preparation of Closing Balance Sheet. As promptly as
practicable, but no later than 5:00 p.m. (Mountain Time) on the 75th
day after the Closing Date or such later date as Purchaser and Seller agree
in writing, Purchaser will prepare or cause to be prepared a consolidated
balance sheet of the Brand Companies as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing
Balance Sheet_ "), prepared in accordance with the Brand Companies'
historical practices and presented in a manner consistent with _Schedule
2.05(b) _ to be delivered to Seller, together with a statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail Purchaser's
calculation of (i) the Cash on Hand, (ii) the Closing Indebtedness, (iii) the
Company Transaction Expenses that were not paid as of the Closing, in each
case, prepared by Purchaser in good faith in accordance with the Brand
Companies' historical practices and presented in a manner consistent with the
pro forma example attached hereto as _Schedule 2.05(b)_, and (iv) the Final
Net Closing Cash Consideration based on the foregoing. In the event that
Purchaser does not deliver the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement within such 75-day period, Purchaser shall be conclusively deemed
to have accepted the Estimated Cash on Hand, the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness and the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses as the Cash on
Hand, the Closing Indebtedness, and the Company Transaction Expenses,
respectively. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, for the purposes of
Seller's review of the Closing Balance Sheet delivered by Purchaser pursuant
to this _Section 2.06(a)_, Purchaser shall afford, and shall cause the
Company to afford, Seller commercially reasonable access during normal
business hours to the books and records (other than privileged documents) of
Purchaser, the Brand Companies and their respective Representatives.

  



  

(b) Disagreement by Seller. If Seller disagrees with Purchaser's
calculation of the Cash on Hand, the Closing Indebtedness and/or the Company
Transaction Expenses as set forth on the Closing Statement, Seller may, within
20 days after receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement,
deliver a notice to Purchaser disagreeing with such calculation(s) and setting
forth in reasonable detail Seller's (i) objection(s) to such calculation(s)
of the Cash on Hand, the Closing Indebtedness, and/or the Company Transaction
Expenses as set forth on the Closing Statement, and (ii) calculation(s)
thereof and of the Final Net Closing Cash Consideration (an " _Objection
Notice_ "). Any Objection Notice shall specify those items or amounts as
to which Seller disagrees (the " _Disputed Items_ "). If Seller fails to
deliver an Objection Notice during such 20-day period, the Cash on Hand, the
Closing Indebtedness, and the Company Transaction Expenses determined by
Purchaser and delivered to Seller in accordance with _Section 2.06(a)_ shall
be deemed final, binding, and conclusive for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 17| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Dispute Resolution.

  



  

(i) If an Objection Notice shall have been timely delivered by
Seller to Purchaser pursuant to _Section 2.06(b)_, Seller and Purchaser
shall, during the 10 days following such delivery, use commercially reasonable
efforts to reach agreement on the Disputed Items in order to determine the
Cash on Hand, the Closing Indebtedness, and/or the Company Transaction
Expenses (in each case, to the extent disputed in the Objection Notice);
_provided_ , that the amount of any agreed upon Disputed Item shall fall
between (or be equal to either) Purchaser's calculation thereof delivered
pursuant to _Section 2.06(a)_ and Seller's calculation thereof delivered
pursuant to _Section 2.06(b)_. If, during such 10-day period, Seller and
Purchaser agree as to any Disputed Item, then Seller and Purchaser shall
execute a written acknowledgement of the amount of such Disputed Item and any
Disputed Item so agreed upon shall be deemed final, binding, and conclusive
for purposes of this Agreement. If, during such period, Seller and Purchaser
are unable to reach agreement on all Disputed Items, then the Disputed Items
that remain in dispute shall be resolved by KPMG LLP or, if such firm is
conflicted or declines to act in such capacity by the office of such other
nationally recognized major firm of independent accountants having no
material relationship with any Party and reasonably acceptable to both Seller
and Purchaser (the " _Accounting Referee_ ").

  



  

(ii) Within 15 days of the retention of the Accounting Referee,
Purchaser and Seller shall jointly submit the matter to the Accounting
Referee and instruct the Accounting Referee that it (A) shall act as an
expert in accounting, and not as an arbitrator, to resolve, in accordance
with the Brand Companies' historical practices and presented in a manner
consistent with _Schedule 2.05(b)_ , only the Disputed Items that remain in
dispute; (B) shall adjust the calculation(s) of the Cash on Hand, the Closing
Indebtedness, and/or the Company Transaction Expenses based thereon to
reflect such resolution; (C) shall determine the amount of any Disputed Item
to be an amount that falls between (or is equal to either) Purchaser's
calculation thereof delivered pursuant to _Section 2.06(a)_ and Seller's
calculation thereof delivered pursuant to _Section 2.06(b)_; and (D) shall
deliver to Purchaser and Seller a written decision as promptly as practicable
and in any event within 30 days following the submission of the
remaining Disputed Items to the Accounting Referee for resolution. The
Accounting Referee shall deliver to Purchaser and Seller, as promptly as
practicable, a report setting forth such calculation. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that, if any Disputed Item is submitted to the Accounting Referee
pursuant to this _Section 2.06(c)_, the Cash on Hand, the Closing
Indebtedness, and/or the Company Transaction Expenses, as determined by the
Accounting Referee, shall be, absent manifest error, final, binding, and
conclusive for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

(iii) If requested by the Accounting Referee, Purchaser and Seller
agree to execute a reasonable engagement letter. The cost of such review and
report (including any retainer) shall be borne (A) by Purchaser if Seller's
calculation of the Final Net Closing Cash Consideration (based on Seller's
position with respect to the Disputed Items submitted to the Accounting
Referee) is closer to the Final Net Closing Cash Consideration calculated by
the Accounting Referee (based on the Accounting Referee's determination of
such Disputed Items), (B) from the Adjustment Escrow Account, if Purchaser's
calculation of the Final Net Closing Cash Consideration (based on Purchaser's
position with respect to the Disputed Items submitted to the Accounting
Referee) is closer to the Final Net Closing Cash Consideration calculated by
the Accounting Referee (based on the Accounting Referee's determination of
such Disputed Items), and (C) otherwise equally by Purchaser and from the
Adjustment Escrow Account. However, initially, any retainer charged by the
Accounting Referee shall be paid 50% by Purchaser and 50% from the Adjustment
Escrow Account.

  



  

(d) Cooperation. Seller and Purchaser will reasonably cooperate and
assist as requested in the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and
the calculations of the Cash on Hand, the Closing Indebtedness, and the
Company Transaction Expenses and in the conduct of the audits and reviews
referred to in this _Section 2.06_, including the making available to the
extent necessary of books, records, work papers, and personnel.

  



  

2.07 Withholding. Purchaser shall be permitted to withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
are required to be withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
Applicable Law (e.g., the applicable payroll Taxes for which the applicable
Brand Company will be liable), and shall duly remit any amounts withheld to
the proper Governmental Entity. Such withheld and remitted amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Seller.

with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. The Financial Statements have been
prepared in accordance with the Brand Companies' historical practices and
fairly present, in all material respects, the financial position, and results
of operations of the Brand Companies as of the respective dates thereof and

subject to the pro forma adjustments and the elimination of inter-
company accounts. The Financial Statements include an allocation or invoicing
of certain expenses to Seller and certain of its Subsidiaries, including,
among others, general corporate expenses related to finance, legal,
information technology, human resources, compliance, shared services,
insurance, employee benefits and incentives, and stock-based compensation.
Purchaser acknowledges that these expenses have been allocated or invoiced to
Seller or certain of its Subsidiaries on the basis of direct usage when
identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a basis of operating income,
headcount, or square footage. Purchaser further acknowledges that actual
costs that would have been incurred if the Brand Companies had been a stand-
alone company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational
structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information
technology and infrastructure and that Seller is not making any
representations with respect to these actual costs or their allocations.

ANY ELECTRONIC OR PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION, OR
OTHERWISE, TO PURCHASER, ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES,
AND PURCHASER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY SUCH REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY.

  



  

(b) In connection with Purchaser's investigation of Seller, the
Brand Companies and Brand Business, Purchaser has received from or on behalf
of Seller and/or the Brand Companies certain estimates, projections,
forecasts, pro formas, plans, budgets or revenues or earnings predictions.
Purchaser acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
make such estimates, projections, forecasts, pro formas, plans, budgets or
revenues or earnings predictions, that Purchaser is familiar with such
uncertainties, that Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making its
own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all projections,
forecasts, budgets or revenues or earnings predictions so furnished to it
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts, pro formas, plans, budgets or revenues or earnings
predictions), and that Purchaser shall have no claim against Seller or any
Brand Company or any of their Representatives or Affiliates with respect
thereto; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing contained in this _Section
6.06_ shall limit Purchaser's remedies (i) in the event of fraud of Seller or
(ii) under this Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Seller makes
no representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections,
forecasts, pro formas, plans, budgets or revenues or earnings predictions
(including any such underlying assumptions). Purchaser confirms that Seller
and the Brand Companies have made available to it and its Representatives the
opportunity to ask questions of the Representatives of the Brand Companies and
Seller and their respective Affiliates and to acquire such additional
information about the business, operations and financial condition of the
Brand Companies and the Brand Business as requested, and all such information
has been received.

6.07 Brokers. Purchaser has not retained any Person to act as a broker
or agreed or become obligated to pay, or has taken any action that
might result in any Person claiming to be entitled to receive, any brokerage
commission, finder's fee or similar commission or fee in connection with any
of the Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

6.08 Investment Intention. Purchaser is acquiring the Purchased
Interests for its own account and not with a view to their distribution
within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the " _Securities Act_ "). Purchaser acknowledges that the Purchased
Interests have not been registered for offer or sale under the Securities Act,
or other Applicable Law, and that the Purchased Interests may not be
transferred, sold or offered for sale except pursuant to the registration
provisions of the Securities Act or other Applicable Law, or pursuant to any
exemption therefrom. Purchaser is an "accredited investor" within the meaning
of Rule 501(a) of the Securities Act, and has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters, and is capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of the Contemplated Transactions.

 | 42| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing and subject to
_Section 7.02(d)_ , each Party shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, afford the other Party, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives, commercially reasonable access upon reasonable
notice during normal business hours, to information and documentation of

may be reasonably requested by such Party in connection with such Party's
Taxes, reporting obligations and compliance with Applicable Laws.

  



  

(c) Purchaser agrees to hold all the books and records of the Brand
Business existing on the Closing Date and not to destroy and dispose of any

(d) Seller acknowledges that it is in possession of and may in the
future obtain possession, including without limitation pursuant to
_Section 7.02(b)_ and _Article X_, of Confidential Information concerning
the Brand Companies and their businesses and operations. Seller shall, and
shall use its best efforts to cause its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives to, treat confidentially and not disclose all or any portion
of such Confidential Information and will use such Confidential Information
solely for the purposes of consummating the Contemplated Transactions or in
connection with Seller's Taxes, reporting obligations and compliance with
Applicable Laws, operating the Gaia Business and for no other purposes;
_provided_ , that the __ Brand Companies may also use the Confidential
Information for the purpose of operating the Brand Business in the ordinary
course. Seller acknowledges and agrees that such Confidential Information is
proprietary and confidential in nature and may be disclosed to its
Representatives only to the extent necessary for Seller to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions or in connection with Seller's Taxes, reporting
obligations and compliance with Applicable Laws and operating the Gaia
Business (it being understood that Seller shall be responsible for any
disclosure by any such Representative not permitted by this Agreement). If
Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives are requested or required
to disclose (after Seller has used its commercially reasonable efforts to
avoid such disclosure and after promptly advising and consulting with
Purchaser about Seller's intention to make, and the proposed contents of,
such disclosure) any of the Confidential Information (whether by deposition,
interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or
similar process), Seller shall, or shall use its best efforts to cause such
Affiliate or Representative, to provide Purchaser with prompt written notice
of such request so that Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective order or
other appropriate remedy, at Purchaser's sole cost and expense. At any time
that such protective order or remedy has not been obtained, Seller may
disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which such Person
is legally required to disclose or of which disclosure is required to avoid
sanction for contempt or any similar sanction, and Seller shall exercise its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded to such Confidential Information so disclosed.
Seller further agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Seller will and
will use its best efforts to cause its Affiliates and Representatives to,
upon the request of Purchaser or the Company, promptly deliver to Purchaser or
the Company all documents, or other tangible embodiments, constituting
Confidential Information or other information with respect to the
Brand Companies; _provided_ , that Seller shall have the right to retain
copies of all such documents, or other tangible embodiments;  _provided,
further,_ that any such retained documents or other tangible embodiments shall
be subject to this _Section 7.02_.

  



  

(e) Following the Closing, upon Purchaser's request and at
Purchaser's sole cost and expense, Seller will either (i) assign all of its
rights and obligations pursuant to the confidentiality agreements entered into
with any Person in connection with the sale of the Brand Business or an
Alternative Transaction Proposal to the extent permitted by the terms of such
confidentiality agreements, or (ii) cooperate with Purchaser in enforcing any
such confidentiality agreements.

  



  

   

 | 43| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.03 Publicity. Purchaser and Seller shall consult in good faith with
each other before issuing any press release or making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions and
provide to the other Party for review a copy of any such press release or
public statement. The foregoing restrictions shall not apply to any disclosure
(a) that may be required by Applicable Law, including the Applicable Laws of
any United States or foreign securities exchange in which case the disclosing
Party shall inform the non-disclosing Party of the required disclosure, and,
to the extent practical provide the non-disclosing Party a copy of such
release or statement prior to its release or filing, it being understood that
the disclosing Party shall have final say on the wording of any such required
disclosure, (b) made in connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy
relating to this Agreement or any Collateral Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions, or (c) to a Party's Representatives as necessary in connection
with the ordinary course of its business. Each Party agrees that it shall (and
shall use commercially reasonable effort to cause its Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives to) hold in confidence all nonpublic
information acquired from the other Party or the other Party's
Representatives in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference in their
entirety.

  



  

7.04 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, each Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the conditions to the obligations of the other
Party as set forth in _Article VIII_ to be satisfied and the Contemplated
Transactions to be consummated in accordance with their terms.

  



  

7.05 HSR Act and Foreign Competition Filings. Without limiting the
general nature of _Section 7.04_, each of Purchaser and Seller shall (and,
to the extent required, shall cause their respective Affiliates to): (a)
comply promptly, and in any event within ten Business Days after the date of
this Agreement, with the notification and reporting requirements of the HSR
Act and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain early termination of
the waiting period under the HSR Act; (b) within five Business Days after the
date of this Agreement, make such other filings with any similar foreign
Antitrust Authorities as may be required under any applicable similar foreign
law; and (c) use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other
Parties in connection with making any filing under the HSR Act or any similar
foreign law and in connection with any filings, communications or
other submissions related to resolving any investigation or other inquiry by
any Antitrust Authority under the HSR Act or any similar foreign law.

  



  

7.06 Consents and Approvals; Representation and Warranty Policy.

  



  

(a) Each of Purchaser and Seller shall (and shall cause each of its
Affiliates to), in addition to complying with their respective
obligations under _Section 7.05_ with respect to Antitrust Authorities,
including obtaining the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act,
use commercially reasonable efforts to assemble, prepare and file any
information (and, as needed, to supplement such information) as may be
reasonably necessary in order to obtain, as promptly as practicable, all
consents and approvals required to be obtained from any Governmental Entity
in order to execute and deliver this Agreement and consummate the Contemplated
Transactions in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 44| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) In addition, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, and, Purchaser shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller in obtaining, any consents from
third parties pursuant to the Contracts set forth on _Schedule 7.06(b)_ (the
" _Material Consents_ "). In connection with each Material Consent, Purchaser
shall promptly comply with any reasonable requests from third parties in
connection with such Material Consents. The Parties agree that nothing
under this _Section 7.06_ shall be interpreted to require Seller, any Brand
Company, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates to pay any amount,
incur any obligation in favor of or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise, regardless of any provision to the contrary in the
underlying Contract, including any requirements for the securing or posting of
any bonds, letters of credit or similar instruments, or the furnishing of any
guarantees) in order to obtain a Material Consent. If any Material Consent is
not obtained prior to the Closing, Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such Material Consent after the Closing, and
Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in any commercially reasonable
arrangement reasonably acceptable to Purchaser to both (i) provide Purchaser
with the interests and benefits of such Contract and (ii) cause Purchaser to
bear all costs and Liabilities of, or under, any such Contracts, until such
time as such Material Consent for such Contract shall have been obtained
(provided, that any incremental costs of such arrangement shall be borne by
Seller, including any costs incurred by Seller in its performance as agent on
behalf of Purchaser if such costs would not have been incurred by Purchaser
had such Material Consent been obtained).

  



  

(c) Purchaser's obligations under _Section 7.05_ and/or this
_Section 7.06_ to use commercially reasonable efforts shall not include (i)
proposing, negotiating, committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order, or otherwise, the sale, transfer, license, divestiture or
other disposition of, or any prohibition or limitation on the ownership,
operation, effective control or exercise of full rights of ownership, of any
of the businesses, product lines or assets of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates or of the Brand Companies or (ii) paying any material amounts or
incurring any material obligations or granting any other material financial
accommodation in connection with obtaining any consents from third parties.

  



  

(d) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions necessary to have fully bound by the
Closing Date, the Representation and Warranty Policy, including, as promptly
as reasonably practical, furnishing the Representation and Warranty Policy
Insurer and its Representatives with all such information as is reasonably
requested by such Persons in connection with the Representation and Warranty
Policy Insurer's issuance of the Representation and Warranty Policy at the
Closing. Seller shall, and shall cause the Brand Companies to, and shall
request the Brand Companies' Representatives to, provide all cooperation
reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with the arrangement and
obtaining of the Representation and Warranty Policy. Purchaser shall keep
Seller reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange and obtain
the Representation and Warranty Policy and provide to Seller copies of all
executed definitive documents related to the Representation and
Warranty Policy. From and after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause
its Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with Purchaser Parties, at such
Purchaser Parties' expense, to the extent necessary in connection with any
claim made by any such Purchaser Party under the Representation and Warranty
Policy.

7.08 Employees.

  



  

(a) No later than four (4) Business Days following the date hereof
(the " _Notice Date_ "), in such form as approved by Seller and Purchaser,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
Seller shall cause the Brand Companies, as applicable, to deliver to (i)
those Brand Employees who work in or are based out of the Brand Companies'
facility in Colorado (the " _Colorado Facility_ ") and who are either
Designated Employees or Transferred Employees, a joint WARN Notice (as
defined below) from Seller and Purchaser notifying such Brand Employees of the
Contemplated Transactions and that, as a result of the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions, the employment of such Designated Employees and
Transferred Employees will be terminated by the applicable Brand Company
effective on the Closing Date (which notice for the Transferred
Employees shall reflect that it is anticipated that they shall receive offers
of employment from Licensees, with such employment to commence immediately
following the Closing Date such that there will be no gap in employment);
_provided, however,_ that if the Closing Date occurs before the 60th day
following the date such notice was sent, the Brand Companies shall terminate
the employment of all such employees on the Closing Date and pay, at
Purchaser's sole cost and expense, such employees in lieu for the balance of
the applicable WARN notice period, if any, and (ii) those Brand Employees who
are either Designated Employees or Transferred Employees that do not work in
and are not based out of the Colorado Facility, notice of the Contemplated
Transactions and that, as a result of the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions, the employment of such Designated Employees and
Transferred Employees will be terminated by the applicable Brand Company
effective on the Closing Date (which notice for the Transferred
Employees shall reflect that it is anticipated that they shall receive offers
of employment from the Licensees, with such employment to commence
immediately following the Closing Date such that there will be no gap in
employment).

  



  

(b) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Notice Date,
Purchaser shall provide Seller with a list of (i) all Brand
Employees designated by the Purchaser (the " _Designated Employees_ ") that,
as a result of the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, are being
terminated pursuant to _Section 7.08(a)_ no later than the Closing Date (but
not including any Transferred Employees, even if such Transferred Employees
do not accept employment with a Licensee); and (ii) all Brand Employees that,
as a result of the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, will
receive offers of employment from Licensees (the " _Transferred Employees_ ")
with such employment commencing immediately following the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) Seller shall provide Purchaser with reasonable assistance and
cooperation in communicating any further information to the Brand
Employees regarding the Contemplated Transactions and the effects thereof
upon the Brand Employees, at such time and in such form mutually agreed upon
by Seller and Purchaser following the date of this Agreement. Seller shall
give Purchaser at least thirty-six (36) hours to review and provide input on
any material written communications Seller intends on delivering to Brand
Employees regarding the impact of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including regarding the treatment of the Company Benefit
Plans following the Closing Date. In that regard, Seller shall ensure that
copies of all written communications and/or slides for presentations are
provided to Purchaser as soon as practicable in advance of the date of
intended communication.

  



  

(d) Seller shall be responsible for maintenance and distribution of
benefits accrued under any Company Benefit Plan pursuant to and if
required by the provisions of such Company Benefit Plans to Brand Employees
for the time period ending on or before the Closing Date.

  



  

(e) The Parties shall cooperate in preparing and distributing any
notices (such notices, " _WARN Notices_ ") to the Brand Employees, and to any
required state and local authorities, pursuant to the federal Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (and any similar state or local
law) (collectively, " _WARN Act_ "), which WARN Notices shall be delivered by
the applicable Brand Company.

  



  

   

 | 46| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) Purchaser shall be responsible for any Liabilities relating to
the WARN Act and the WARN Notices, and any requirement to provide
notice pursuant to the WARN Act, which arises out of or results from any
termination of employment or other "employment loss" of any Brand Employee at
the direction of Purchaser; _provided_ that Seller has complied with its
obligations under _Sections 7.08(a)_ and _7.08(d)_. Purchaser agrees to
promptly reimburse Seller or its Affiliates for all reasonable,
documented out-of-pocket costs incurred in preparing, reviewing or
distributing any such WARN Notices.

  



  

(g) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be solely liable for all
benefits (including, but not limited to, severance in accordance with the
severance practice maintained by the Brand Companies as of the date hereof),
and other liabilities and obligations arising from or relating to the
termination of a Designated Employee and a Transferred Employee on the Closing
Date, and Seller shall bear no liability or obligation relating to such
terminations. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Licensees, pursuant to the terms of their agreements with Purchaser and/or
its Affiliates, to provide any Transferred Employee who is terminated by any
such Licensee during the twelve (12) months following the Closing Date,
severance in accordance with the severance practice maintained by the Brand
Companies as of the date hereof. Seller has previously made available to
Purchaser a written description of the severance practice maintained by the
Brand Companies as of the date hereof, which at Purchaser's request,
requires in order for severance to payable (i) the execution of a valid
release and waiver of claims by employees in favor or their employer and (ii)
that an employee has not been offered substantially similar employment (same
salary and location) in connection with the sale of the business in which
they work (regardless of whether the applicable employee actually accepts such
employment). For the avoidance of doubt, neither Purchaser nor the Brand
Companies shall have any Liability with respect to severance, benefits, or
any other amounts payable by a Licensee to any Transferred Employee following
the Closing.

  



  

(h) Seller will provide continued health and medical coverage as may
be required under Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I
of ERISA or any other Applicable Law or ordinance to all eligible current and
former Brand Employees and independent contractors (and the spouses,
dependents and beneficiaries of any such current or former Brand Employees and
independent contractors) with respect to whom a "qualifying event" (as such
term is defined under Sections 4980B(f)(3) of the Code or 603 of ERISA) or
other triggering event described under the Applicable Laws or ordinances
occurred on or before the Closing Date.

  



  

(i) Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its Licensees to provide, to each Transferred Employee for a period of 12
months immediately following the Closing Date (i) no less than the same wage
rate or cash salary level in effect for such Transferred Employee immediately
prior to the Closing and (ii) employee benefit plans, cash incentive
compensation opportunities and fringe benefits that, when taken as a whole,
are substantially the same or similar in value, as those in effect immediately
prior to the Closing (other than with respect to the value of any matching
contribution under Seller's 401(k) Plan or the value of any additional
vacation, sick time or personal time off entitlement such employees may have
had prior to the Closing Date).

  



  

(j) Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its Licensees to, under any plan providing health benefits in which
Transferred Employees, as applicable, will participate after the Closing
Date, (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to
such Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents, as applicable, and
(ii) subject to Seller providing Purchaser with the applicable information
with respect to each Transferred Employee in a form that Purchaser determines
is administratively necessary to take into account under its plans or the
plans of its Affiliates or Licensees, provide credit to each Transferred
Employee, as applicable, for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by the Transferred Employee during the portion of the relevant
plan year including the Closing Date. For eligibility and vesting purposes
under any tax-qualified retirement plan sponsored or maintained by the
Licensees, Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Licensee to, provide Transferred Employees with past service credit for
such Transferred Employees' service to Seller, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates, as applicable. The foregoing provisions of this
_Section 7.08(j)_ shall be effective only to the extent: (A) such service
would have been credited under a comparable Company Benefit Plan, (B) such
service would not result in a duplication of benefits, and (C) such service
credit would not violate the qualified status of any tax-qualified retirement
plan or violate any provision of any Applicable Law. Furthermore, the
provisions of this _Section 7.08(j)_ shall not apply as follows: (1) such
service credit shall not be given with respect to benefit accruals under any
defined benefit plan or retiree medical savings account plan, and (2) such
service credit shall not be given with respect to any newly established plan
for which prior service is not taken into account for employees of Seller.

(k) Purchaser agrees that it shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its Licensees to agree that each Transferred Employee who
receives an "eligible rollover distribution" (within the meaning of Section
402(c)(4) of the Code) from the Seller 401(k) Plan shall be eligible to
rollover such distribution (including an in-kind rollover of outstanding notes
associated with participant plan loans) to the applicable Licensee 401(k)
Plan, in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures adopted by the
plan administrators of such plans. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the Licensees shall not assume any liabilities arising under or
relating to the Seller 401(k) Plan. Purchaser agrees that it shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Licensees to (i) to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, provide Transferred Employees with a 90-day grace
period with regard to participant loan repayments with the goal of avoiding
any deemed distributions in respect of participant loans, and (ii) cause the
trustee and plan administrator of the applicable Licensee 401(k) Plan to
accept an in-kind rollover of any such participant loans, subject to being
reasonably satisfied that such participant loans are properly documented and
compliant with Sections 4975(d)(1) and 72(p)(2) of the Code. Seller agrees to
cause the unvested components of any and all accounts of
Transferred Employees under the Seller 401(k) Plan to automatically vest on
the Closing Date.

  



  

(l) On or prior to the Closing Date (as set forth in _Section
8.03(d)_ ), Purchaser shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Payroll
Provider the Designated Employee Accrued PTO Amount, the Severance Amount and
the WARN Amount, in each case in accordance with _Section 8.03(d)_ hereof.

  



  

(m) On or prior to the Closing Date (as set forth in _Section
8.02(e)_ ), Seller shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Payroll
Provider (i) the Transferred Employee Accrued PTO Amount in accordance with
_Section 8.02(e)_ and (ii) $500,000 in respect of certain severance
obligations of Seller and the Brand Companies.

  



  

7.09 DandO Tail Policy and Related Matters. Prior to the Closing Date,
Seller may, or may cause the Brand Companies to, purchase a six year "tail"
policy of liability insurance that covers events occurring on or prior to the
Closing (the " _Tail Policy_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the cost of such Tail Policy shall constitute a Company
Transaction Expense. Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any Brand
Company to, amend, repeal or modify in a manner adverse to the beneficiary
thereof any provision in such Brand Company's Organizational Documents
relating to exculpation or indemnification of current ( _i.e._ , as of the
date hereof and as of the Closing) and former officers and directors of any
Brand Company (collectively, the " _Brand Directors_ ") as in effect as of the
date hereof, it being the intent of the Parties that the Brand Directors
prior to the Closing shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification to the fullest extent permitted under such Organizational
Documents. Seller shall not amend, repeal or modify any of its
Organizational Documents relating to exculpation or indemnification in a
manner adverse to the Brand Directors, it being the intent of the
Parties that the Brand Directors shall continue to be entitled to such
exculpation and indemnification to the fullest extent permitted thereunder.

7.10 Tax Matters.

  



  

(a) In the case of Taxes arising in a taxable period of any Brand
Company that begins on or before and ends after the Closing Date (the "
_Straddle Period_ ") (i) the allocation of income Taxes or other Taxes based
upon the income or receipts of (or consideration, interest or other
compensation paid by) the Brand Companies between the Pre-Closing Period and
the Post-Closing Period shall be made on the basis of an interim closing of
the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date to the extent that
there is no actual closing of the taxable year on such Closing Date; (ii) the
amount of ad valorem and other Taxes of the Brand Companies attributable to
the Pre-Closing Period shall equal the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period (excluding extraordinary items attributable to actions taken
by Purchaser or a Brand Company after the Closing Date that is outside the
ordinary course of business of the applicable Brand Company) multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period
through the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the _total_ number
of days in the taxable period; and (iii) the remainder of the ad valorem and
of the other Taxes of the Brand Companies shall be attributable to the Post-
Closing Period. To the extent any Brand Company is permitted but not required
under applicable state, local, or foreign income Tax laws to treat the
Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, then the Parties shall treat
the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period.

  



  

(b) Seller shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, all Tax Returns of the Brand Companies for all periods ending on
or prior to the Closing Date, including, without limitation, Tax Returns for
such periods which are to be filed after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall
not amend or revoke any Tax Returns (or any elections relating thereto) filed
or to be filed by Seller hereunder without Seller's prior written consent
which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld. For
any Tax Returns with respect to the Brand Companies that is the
responsibility of Seller under this _Section 7.10(b)_ , Seller shall (i)
prepare and file such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past
practice of the Brand Companies, as the case may be, unless otherwise
required by Applicable Law, and (ii) deliver to Purchaser for its review,
comment and consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) a copy of such proposed Tax Return at least 20 days
prior to the due date (giving effect to any validly obtained extension)
thereof. Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed,
all Tax Returns with respect to the Brand Companies for all Tax periods ending
after the Closing Date including any Straddle Periods. For any Tax Return of
any of the Brand Companies with respect to a Straddle Period that is the
responsibility of Purchaser under this _Section 7.10(b)_ , Purchaser shall
(i) prepare and file such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past
practice of the Brand Companies, as the case may be, unless otherwise required
by Applicable Law, and (ii) deliver to Seller for its review and comment a
copy of such proposed Tax Return (accompanied, where appropriate, by a
calculation of the allocation between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-
Closing Period of the Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Return) at least 20
days prior to the due date (giving effect to any validly obtained extension)
thereof and Purchaser shall, in good faith, consider any comments from
Seller. Seller shall pay (i) to the relevant Governmental Entity any amount
due and payable on any Tax Return for all periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date (unless paid to the Purchaser pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii)),
(ii) to Purchaser all Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing Periods due with
respect to any Tax Return of any of the Brand Companies with respect to a
Straddle Period that is the responsibility of Purchaser under this _Section
7.10(b)_ , and (iii) to Purchaser any amount due and payable on any Tax
Return of any of the Brand Companies for all Pre-Closing Periods which are to
be filed after the Closing Date, that Purchaser is required under Applicable
Law to file. Payments made pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding sentence
shall be paid on or before the due date of the Tax Return on which such Taxes
are reported and payments made pursuant to clauses (ii) or (iii) of the
preceding sentence shall be paid on or before three (3) Business Days prior to
the due date of the Tax Return on which such Taxes are reported.

  



  

   

 | 49| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Purchaser shall have the right to control any Tax audits, Tax
disputes or administrative, judicial or other proceedings (" _Tax
Controversies_ ") with respect to the Brand Companies; _provided, however_ ,
that in the case of any Tax Controversy that relates to any Taxes that could
give rise to a liability of Seller under this Agreement and to the extent such
Taxes are not covered by the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy,
Seller may participate in such Tax Controversy at Seller's expense, and
Purchaser shall not enter into any agreement that represents a final
determination of the matter without Seller's prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
_provided, further,_ that in the case of any Tax Controversy that relates to
Taxes that could give rise to Liability of Seller under this Agreement and
that could not reasonably be expected to adversely impact the Tax Liability
of Purchaser, Seller shall have the right to control such Tax Controversy, in
which case, Seller shall not enter into any agreement that represents a final
determination of the matter without Purchaser's prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and
Purchaser may participate in such Tax Controversy at Purchaser's expense.
Seller shall execute, or cause to be executed, powers of attorney or other
documents reasonably necessary to enable Purchaser to take all actions
necessary in connection with any Tax Controversies. Purchaser shall have the
authority to represent the interests of the Company with respect to any Tax
Controversy related to the Section 338(h)(10) Election; _provided, however,_
that Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably informed of such Tax Controversy
and shall allow Seller to make comments to Purchaser regarding the conduct of
or positions taken by Purchaser in such Tax Controversy; _provided, further,_
that Purchaser shall not consent to any settlement of any such Tax Controversy
without the prior written consent of Seller, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(d) If, after the Closing Date, Purchaser, any Brand Company or any
Affiliate of Purchaser receives any document with respect to the Tax matters
of the Brand Companies, the Purchased Interests, or the assets, operations or
activities of the Brand Companies that could affect Seller, or Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller receives any document with respect to the Tax matters of
the Brand Companies, the Purchased Interests, or the assets, operations or
activities of the Brand Companies, the Party receiving such document
shall supply a copy of such document to the potentially affected Party within
seven days of receipt. For this purpose, such Tax documents shall include
requests for information, notices of proposed adjustments, revenue agent's
reports or similar reports and notices of deficiency. Any information
provided or obtained under this _Section 7.10(d)_ shall be kept confidential,
except as may otherwise be necessary in connection with the filing of a Tax
Return, refund claims, Tax audits, Tax claims or Tax Controversies or as
required by Applicable Law.

  



  

(e) Any refund of Taxes (including any interest thereon) that
relates to the Brand Companies and that is attributable to a Post-
Closing Period, shall be the property of Purchaser and shall be retained by
Purchaser (or promptly paid by Seller to Purchaser if any such refund (or
interest thereon) is received by Seller). If after the Closing Date, any Brand
Company or any member of Purchaser's consolidated Tax group receives a refund
of any Tax that relates to such Brand Company and is attributable to a Pre-
Closing Period, then Purchaser shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to
Seller the amount of such refund, together with any interest paid
thereon. Any refund of Taxes (including any interest thereon) for a Straddle
Period shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing
Period in accordance with _Section 7.10(a)_. Seller shall repay to Purchaser
the amount paid over pursuant to this _Section 7.10(e)_ (plus any penalties,
interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Entity) in the
event that Purchaser is required to repay such refund to such Governmental
Entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all such refunds shall be reduced by
the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable external
legal and advisory costs) incurred solely in connection with obtaining such
refund.

  



  

   

 | 50| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) After the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall, each at its own
expense, cooperate with each other and with each other's Representative, in
connection with the preparation or audit of any Tax Return, refund claim or
Tax Controversy matter with respect to the activities of the Brand Companies,
and such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Party's
reasonable request) the provision of records and information, including work
papers (but excluding records and information that are protected by
recognized professional privilege) which are reasonably relevant to any Tax
Returns, claims for refund, Tax Controversies or other action with respect to
the activities of the Brand Companies, and shall include making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Purchaser and Seller agree
(i) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
the activities of the Brand Companies relating to the six year period (or
portion thereof) prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) to give the other Party
reasonable written notice prior to destroying or discarding any such books
and records and, if the other Party so requests, Purchaser or Seller, as the
case may be, shall allow the other Party to take possession of such books and
records.

  



  

(g) Seller and Purchaser shall join in making an election under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding equivalent
elections under state or local law) (a " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ ")
with respect to the Contemplated Transaction under this Agreement (i.e. the
acquisition of the stock of Gaiam Americas for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes) such that Purchaser is treated as acquiring the assets of Gaiam
Americas for U.S. federal income, state, local and/or franchise tax purposes.
Except as otherwise provided herein, Seller shall include in all relevant Tax
calculations and filings any income, gain, loss, deduction, or other Tax item
resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election, including (i) any Tax imposed
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(2), or (ii) any state or
local Tax imposed. In connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Election (or as
soon thereafter as reasonably practicable), the Parties shall file all
federal, state, local and other forms necessary to make the Section
338(h)(10) Election jointly and shall make any required filings and take any
and all other reasonable actions necessary or appropriate to effect the
Section 338(h)(10) Election. Seller shall include in Seller's income Tax
Returns for the taxable period, which includes the Closing Date, any forms
that are required to be so included on account of the Section 338(h)(10)
Election. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate fully, and in good faith, with
each other in making the Section 338(h)(10) Election. No later than ninety
(90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller shall sign and date IRS
Form 8023 or a signature schedule attached thereto, shall provide their
taxpayer identification numbers, shall sign any corresponding state or local
forms required in connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Election, and shall
provide any other information required by Form 8023 and any corresponding
state or local form. All such forms to be signed shall be prepared by
Purchaser. Purchaser shall retain and promptly file the executed IRS Form
8023 and corresponding state and local forms and shall provide to Seller a
copy of each such form. Purchaser shall not make an election under Section
338(g) of the Code with respect to Modern Lotus, Ltd. and Gaiam Limited (the "
_338(g) Subsidiaries_ ") without the written consent of Seller, which consent
may be withheld in its sole discretion.

  



  

(h) The Parties shall comply with (and not waive) the provisions of
any so-called "bulk transfer law" or similar laws of any jurisdiction in
connection with transactions contemplated hereunder.

7.11 Allocation. The Purchase Price and the Liabilities of the Company
and Gaiam Americas (plus other relevant items, including any amount
treated as having been paid for the assets of the Company and Gaiam Americas
under Section 338 of the Code) shall be allocated among the assets owned by
the Company and Gaiam Americas in accordance with Section 338 of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Such allocation (the " _Allocation_ ")
shall be adjusted after the Closing to the extent necessary to reflect
any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.05_ and _Section
2.06_ in the manner determined by the Parties. Purchaser shall deliver to
Seller the Allocation within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date. Purchaser
and Seller shall make good faith efforts to agree on the Allocation. If
Purchaser and Seller are able to agree upon such Allocation, each of
Purchaser, Seller the Company and the Brand Companies shall prepare and file
IRS Form 8883 (and any applicable forms required under state or local
Applicable Law) and supplementary forms in respect of the Section 338(h)(10)
Election in a timely manner consistent with such Allocation and shall file
all Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims for refund) and
information reports in a manner consistent with such Allocation. Seller and
Purchaser shall each provide the other with a copy of the IRS Form 8883
it files and any corresponding forms required under state or local Applicable
Law. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to agree upon the Allocation, the
Parties shall submit the matter to the Accounting Referee to be resolved in a
manner similar to the process described in _Section 2.06(c)_.

  



  

7.12 Expenses; Transfer Taxes.

  



  

(a) Whether or not the Closing takes place, except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, all Transaction Expenses shall be paid by
the Party incurring such expense; _provided, however,_ that (i) the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Referee, if applicable, shall be paid or
reimbursed in accordance with _Section 2.06(c)(iii)_, and (ii) the filing fee
payable upon the filing of a Notification and Report Form for Certain Mergers
and Acquisitions under the HSR Act and any comparable Antitrust Laws shall be
borne by fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser.

  



  

(b) Any transfer Taxes, sales Taxes, stamp duties, filing fees,
registration fees, recordation expenses, or other similar taxes,
fees, charges or expenses incurred by Seller or any other party in connection
with the Contemplated Transactions, including any transfer Taxes related to
the Section 338(h)(10) Election, shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Seller
and fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser.

  



  

7.13 Dividends or Distributions. Prior to Closing, Seller shall be
permitted to cause any Brand Company to (a) declare or pay a dividend or
distribution to the equityholders of such Brand Company from any Cash on Hand
and (b) use any Cash on Hand to pay Company Transaction Expenses.

  



  

7.14 Financing.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser
shall use its best efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters and any related Fee
Letters. Purchaser shall not permit any amendment, modification or supplement
to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Debt
Commitment Letters or any related Fee Letter, if such amendment, modification
or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by
changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount), when
taken together with Purchaser's cash on hand, to an amount below the amount
required to satisfy Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement, or (ii)
imposes new or additional conditions or other terms or otherwise expands,
amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing
or other terms in a manner that could reasonably be expected to delay in any
material respect or prevent the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Purchaser may, after consultation with Seller, replace or amend the Debt
Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as
of the date hereof so long as such action would not reasonably be expected to
materially delay or prevent the Closing; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
exercise of any "flex" provisions in the Fee Letter shall not be considered an
expansion, amendment, or modification of any of the conditions to the receipt
of the Debt Financing or other terms in a manner that could reasonably be
expected to delay in any material respect or prevent the Closing. Any
reference in this Agreement to (x) "Debt Financing" shall include the
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as amended or modified
in compliance with this _Section 7.14 _ and (y) "Fee Letter" and "Debt
Commitment Letters" shall include such documents as amended or modified in
compliance with this _Section 7.14_.

  



  

   

 | 52| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Purchaser shall use its best efforts to (i) maintain in effect
the Debt Commitment Letters in accordance with the terms and subject to
the conditions thereof; (ii) negotiate and enter into all definitive
agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser with
respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters on
the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters and any
related Fee Letter; (iii) satisfy, to the extent within its control, all
conditions to such definitive agreements that are applicable to Purchaser and
consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing; and (iv) comply
with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letters and any related Fee
Letter. Upon request (which request may be made telephonically or in
electronic mail), Purchaser shall keep the Company and Seller reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status
of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and any material
developments relating thereto and provide to Seller copies of all definitive
documents related to the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Purchaser shall give the Company and Seller prompt written
notice (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) of (A) any breach or
default (or any event or circumstance that with or without notice, lapse of
time, or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or
default) or the threatened breach by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letters, Fee Letter or any other definitive document related to
the Debt Financing of which Purchaser becomes aware, (B) the receipt by
Purchaser of any notice or other communication from any Debt Financing source
with respect to any (1) breach, default, termination or repudiation by any
party to the Debt Commitment Letters, Fee Letter or any other definitive
document related to the Debt Financing of any provisions of the Debt
Commitment Letters, Fee Letter or any other definitive document related to the
Debt Financing or (2) dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to
the Debt Commitment Letters, Fee Letter or any other definitive
document related to the Debt Financing, and (C) if for any reason Purchaser
reasonably believes that it may not be able to obtain on a timely basis all
or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters or the definitive
documents relating to the Debt Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable,
but in any event within two (2) Business Days of the date the Company or
Seller delivers to Purchaser a written request, Purchaser shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company or Seller relating to any
circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the immediately
preceding sentence.

  



  

(c) Purchaser shall use its best efforts to cause the lenders and
any other Persons providing Debt Financing to fund on the Closing Date
the Debt Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters, if all conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VIII_ herein are
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions).

  



  

(d) Nothing herein shall obligate Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
to (i) waive any terms or conditions of this Agreement or of the Debt
Commitment Letters, (ii) pay any additional material fees or amounts beyond
those expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters to cause the lenders
and any other Persons providing Debt Financing to fund the Debt Financing, or
(iii) commence any Proceeding against any financing institution or other
Person that fails to provide its respective portion of the Debt
Financing under the Debt Commitment Letters or New Debt Commitment Letter.

  



  

   

 | 53| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) If any Debt Commitment Letter shall be terminated or modified in
a manner adverse to Purchaser (other than as a result of a breach of Seller's
obligations hereunder or the exercise of "flex" provisions in the Fee Letter),
or if any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters (other than as a
result of obtaining substitute debt financing in accordance with _Section
7.14(e)_ ), Purchaser shall use its best efforts to arrange to promptly
obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on economic terms not
materially less favorable to Purchaser than the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letters and on non-economic terms not materially less favorable to Purchaser
than the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter, in each case, taken as a whole,
and in an amount which, together with its cash on hand, shall be sufficient
(subject to the fulfilment of the conditions set forth in this Agreement ) to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions (the " _Alternate Debt Financing_
"), and to obtain a new financing commitment letter with respect to such
Alternate Debt Financing (the " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ "), which shall
replace the existing Debt Commitment Letter, a true and complete copy of
which (together with any related fee or other letter) shall be promptly
provided to Seller (subject to redaction so long as such redaction does not
cover terms that would adversely affect the conditionality or availability of
the Debt Financing). In the event any New Debt Commitment Letter is obtained,
(i) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall mean the
debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified
pursuant to clause (ii) below, (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any Debt Commitment
Letter that is not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in
question and any New Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect and
(iii) any reference in this Agreement to "Fee Letter" shall be deemed to
include any fee or other letter relating to the Debt Commitment Letter that
are not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question
and any New Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect.

  



  

7.15 Financing Cooperation.

  



  

(a) Following the date hereof and prior to the Closing, Seller
shall, and shall cause each of the Brand Companies and their respective
Representatives and employees to provide to Purchaser such cooperation
reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with the Debt
Financing, including:

  



  

(i) causing appropriate officers and employees of Seller and the
Brand Companies to be available on a customary basis to meet with
prospective lenders, rating agencies and investors in presentations,
meetings, road shows and due diligence sessions and assist with the
preparation of projections and other pertinent information in form and
substance not previously provided to Purchaser as reasonably requested by
Purchaser's lender(s) in connection with the Debt Financing;

  



  

(ii) cooperating with prospective lenders' due diligence, to the
extent customary and reasonable, including, but not limited to, the
delivery of Organizational Documents of the Brand Companies and lien
searches, and reasonably cooperating with Purchaser to facilitate
an appraisal of the Intellectual Property owned by the Brand Companies, each
as contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters;

  



  

(iii) executing and delivering into escrow any credit agreement,
customary and reasonable pledge and security documents, guarantee documents,
supplemental indenture, currency or interest hedging arrangements, other

documents with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser or
otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral;

  



  

(iv) furnishing Purchaser and its sources of Debt Financing as
promptly as practicable financial statements with respect to the period
following the date hereof as reasonably required by such sources and not
previously provided to Purchaser by Seller;

  



  

(v) furnishing Purchaser, within the time period specified in the
Debt Commitment Letters or as otherwise reasonably requested by the
sources of the Debt Financing with all documentation and other information
required by regulators and authorities under applicable "know your customer"
and anti-money laundering and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act of
2001;

  



  

   

 | 54| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(vi) taking such reasonable actions as may be required, proper or
advisable, as requested by Purchaser, to facilitate the guarantee and
pledge of collateral to secure the Debt Financing, including cooperating in
connection with the pay-off of existing Indebtedness and the release of Liens
related thereto; and

  



  

(vii) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain customary pay-off
letters, Lien releases, instruments of termination, waivers, consents, and
approvals from other parties to Contracts and Liens to which the Brand
Companies are a party or by which any of them or their assets or properties
are bound or subject;

  

 _ _

  

 _provided,_ that (1) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the
extent it would require the Company or its Affiliates to waive or amend any
terms of this Agreement or to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses
or give any indemnities prior to the Closing for which it has not received
prior reimbursement by or on behalf of Purchaser or for which it has not
otherwise agreed to pay or reimburse under this Agreement, or to give any
indemnities or incur any liabilities other than reimbursements and liabilities
of the Brand Companies that are effective only after the Closing, (2) nothing
herein shall require such cooperation from the Company or its Affiliates to
the extent it would unreasonably interfere with or disrupt the ongoing
operations of the Company or its Affiliates, (3) no action, liability or
obligation of the Company under any certificate, agreement, arrangement,
document or instrument relating to the Debt Financing shall be effective
until after the Closing and (4) neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates
shall be required to issue any offering documents, private placement
memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents
required in relation to the Debt Financing, but such documents may contain
disclosure and financial statements reflecting the Company as the obligor
following the Closing.

  



  

(b) Purchaser shall promptly, upon request by the Company or Seller,
reimburse Seller for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company,
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives in connection
with the cooperation of the Company and any other Brand Company contemplated
by this _Section 7.15_, and the foregoing obligations shall survive
termination of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) In no event shall Seller, the Company, any Brand Company or any
of their Affiliates be in breach of this Agreement because of the failure by
the Company or any Brand Company to deliver any financial or other information
that is not currently readily available to the Company or any Brand Company

products and/or services to or participate in the ownership, management,
operation or control of, provide financing to or otherwise advise or assist
or be actively connected with, directly or indirectly, any enterprise or
business which is of the type or character that engages in, or otherwise

competition with the Brand Business, except that Seller may own, in the
aggregate, 5% or less of the stock of any corporation which is listed on a
national stock exchange or actively traded in the over-the-counter market; (B)
solicit or attempt to solicit (other than on behalf of any Brand Company) any
Person that is, or within two (2) years before the Closing Date was, a client,
customer, supplier, licensee or business relation of the Brand Business, or
who Seller, any Brand Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries solicited to be a client, customer, supplier or licensee of the

(d) Acknowledgement.

  



  

(i) It is the desire and intent of the Parties that the provisions
of _Sections 7.16(a)_ , 7.16(b), _7.16(c)_ , _7.17(a)_ ,  _7.17(b)_ and
_7.17(c)_ shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under Applicable
Law and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is
sought. If any particular provisions or portion of any of _Section 7.16(a)_
, 7.16(b), _7.16(c)_ , _7.17(a)_ , _7.17(b)_ or _7.17(c)_ shall be
adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, such Section _7.16(a)_ , 7.16(b), _7.16(c)_ , _7.17(a)_ ,
_7.17(b)_ or  _7.17(c)_ , as applicable, shall be deemed amended to delete
therefrom such provision or portion adjudicated to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, such amendment to apply only with respect to the operation of
_Section 7.16(a)_ , 7.16(b), _7.16(c)_ ,  _7.17(a)_ , _7.17(b)_ or _7.17(c)_
, as applicable, in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is
made. The Parties agree that the scope, area and duration of the covenants
set forth in _Sections 7.16(a)_ , 7.16(b), _7.16(c)_ ,  _7.17(a)_ , _7.17(b)_
and _7.17(c)_ are reasonable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree
that if the scope, area or duration of any covenant set forth in _Sections
7.16(a)_ , 7.16(b), _7.16(c)_ , _7.17(a)_ , _7.17(b)_  and _7.17(c)_ shall be
adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be overly broad or
otherwise unreasonable, such court may reduce the scope, area and duration
thereof to that which it deems the maximum scope, area and duration reasonable
under the circumstances, such reduced scope, area and duration to apply only
with respect to the operation of _Section 7.16(a)_ , 7.16(b), _7.16(c)_ ,
_7.17(a)_ , _7.17(b)_ or _7.17(c)_ , as applicable, in the particular

(ii) The Parties recognize that the performance of the obligations
under _Sections 7.16(a)_ , 7.16(b), _7.16(c)_ , _7.17(a)_ ,  _7.17(b)_ and
_7.17(c)_ is special, unique and extraordinary in character, and that in the
event of a breach by either Party of the terms and conditions of any of
_Section 7.16(a)_ , 7.16(b), _7.16(c)_ , _7.17(a)_ , _7.17(b)_ or  _7.17(c)_
to be performed by such Party, the other Party has no adequate remedy at law
for any such breach, and therefore, the Parties agree that, each Party and
the Brand Companies shall, in addition to the other remedies that may be
available to either of them under this Agreement at law (including to obtain
damages for any breach of _Sections 7.16(a)_ , _7.16(c)_ , _7.16(c)_ , 
_7.17(a)_ , _7.17(b)_ and _7.17(c)_ ), be entitled, if they so elect, to
enforce the specific performance thereof by such Party or to enjoin any
employees of such Party or any of its Affiliates from performing services for
any Person.

  



  

(iii) Seller agrees that the covenants and agreements of Seller set
forth in _Sections 7.16(a)_ , _7.16(c)_ and _7.16(c)_ are independent of all
other covenants, representations, warranties and agreements of the Parties set
forth in this Agreement, and no default, breach or failure to perform by any
Party shall constitute an excuse or other justification for Seller to fail to
observe fully its covenants and agreements under _Sections 7.16(a)_ ,
_7.16(c)_ and _7.16(c)_. No course of dealing between Purchaser and Seller,
and no delay by Purchaser in exercising any right, power or remedy under this
Section _7.16(d)_ , in equity or at law, shall constitute a waiver of, or
otherwise prejudice, any such right, power or remedy.

  



  

(iv) Purchaser agrees that the covenants and agreements of Purchaser
set forth in _Sections 7.17(a)_ , _7.17(b)_ and _7.17(c)_ are independent of
all other covenants, representations, warranties and agreements of the Parties
set forth in this Agreement, and no default, breach or failure to perform by
any Party shall constitute an excuse or other justification for Purchaser to
fail to observe fully its covenants and agreements under _Sections 7.17(a)_ ,
_7.17(b)_ and _7.17(c)_. No course of dealing between Purchaser and Seller,
and no delay by Seller in exercising any right, power or remedy under this
Section _7.16(d)_ , in equity or at law, shall constitute a waiver of, or
otherwise prejudice, any such right, power or remedy.

7.18 Intellectual Property Title Matters. To the extent that any
Registered Company Intellectual Property is not in the legal name of the
Brand Companies, is subject to a chain of title defect, or is subject to any
form of Lien (other than (i) the Permitted Liens, and (ii) non-exclusive
licenses granted in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice), Seller shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each of its applicable Subsidiaries to, prior to and following the Closing, at
Seller's sole expense, prepare, execute and file for record such instruments
and documents necessary to cure such title defects, provide for current
ownership of the asset by the Brand Companies and remove any and all such
Liens in such Company Intellectual Property following the Closing (all such
actions, the " _IP Title Corrective Actions_ "); _provided_ that, to the

_Company Trademarks_ ") except for references in historical, Tax, and similar
records, other permissible fair use and as otherwise required by
Applicable Law or as set forth in the IP License Agreement; _provided_ , that
that Seller shall change its name (and amend its certificate of incorporation

7.20 Shareholder Consent; Information Statement. Seller shall use its
best efforts to obtain the Shareholder Consent as promptly as
practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, including
exercising any rights Seller may have under any voting agreements or similar
arrangements that Seller and any of its shareholders is a party to. Within
five (5) Business Days following the receipt of the Shareholder Consent,
Seller shall prepare and file with the SEC the Information Statement. Seller
shall promptly notify Purchaser of the receipt of any comments of the SEC
with respect to the Information Statement and of any requests by the SEC for
any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information, and shall
promptly provide to Purchaser copies of all correspondence between Seller or
any Representative of Seller and the SEC with respect to the Information

requests for additional information by, and replies to comments of, the SEC,
(ii) take into good faith consideration all comments reasonably proposed by
Purchaser and (iii) not file such document with the SEC prior to providing

reasonably practicable (but no more than twenty (20) Business Days) after the
Information Statement has been declared effective by the SEC. Purchaser shall
furnish all information concerning itself and its Subsidiaries as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Information Statement. Purchaser agrees that it shall
reasonably cooperate with and assist Seller, including providing Seller upon
request (as promptly as reasonably practicable) with the information
concerning Purchaser and its Affiliates, directors and officers required to
be included in the Information Statement. If at any time prior to the
Closing, any information relating to Seller or Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by Seller
or Purchaser that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Information Statement so that the Information Statement shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be filed with the SEC, and to the extent required by Applicable Law,
disseminated to the shareholders of Seller. Seller shall be solely
responsible for the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation, mailing and filing of the Information Statement.

  



  

7.21 No Solicitation.

  



  

(a) _Alternative Transaction_. Seller shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries (including the Brand Companies) and its and their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly facilitate, induce or encourage the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to
an Alternative Transaction Proposal, or (ii) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish
to any Person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any
way that would otherwise reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative
Transaction Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by Seller,
any of its Subsidiaries (including the Brand Companies) or its or their
respective Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section
7.21(a)_ by Seller. Seller will, and will cause each of the Brand Companies
and each of its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any
Alternative Transaction Proposal. Seller agrees that it will take all
commercially reasonable steps to promptly inform its Representatives of the
obligations undertaken in this _Section 7.21(a)_.

(b) _Superior Proposal_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in _Section 7.21(a)_, in the event that Seller or any Brand
Company receives after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, an unsolicited, bona fide
written Alternative Transaction Proposal which the Board determines to be, or
to be reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal, Seller may then
take the following actions (but only if (x) (A) the Board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take the following actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law, and (B) Seller has given Purchaser prior written notice
of its intention to take any of the following actions and of the identity of
the Person or group making such Alternative Transaction Proposal and the
material terms and conditions of such Alternative Transaction Proposal and (y)
Seller shall not have breached any of, and continues to comply with all of,
the provisions of this _Section 7.21_):

  



  

(i) furnish nonpublic information with respect to Seller and its
Subsidiaries and the Brand Business to the Person or group making such
Alternative Transaction Proposal; _provided_ , that prior to furnishing any
such nonpublic information, it receives from such Person or group an executed
confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality terms at least as
restrictive as the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and
which shall not contain any exclusivity provision or other term that would
restrict, in any manner, Seller's ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and

  



  

(ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group
with respect to such Alternative Transaction Proposal.

  



  

(c) _Notification_. In addition to the obligations of Seller set
forth in _Sections 7.21(a)_, _7.21(b)_ , and _7.21(d)_ , as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after receipt of
any Alternative Transaction Proposal, Seller shall provide Purchaser with the
identity of the Person or group making any such Alternative Transaction
Proposal and oral and written notice of the material terms and conditions of
such Alternative Transaction Proposal. Seller shall provide Purchaser as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) with
such information as is reasonably necessary to keep Purchaser informed in all
material respects regarding, and the status and terms of, and changes in any
such Alternative Transaction Proposal. Seller shall provide Purchaser with
two (2) Business Days' prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is
provided to the Board) of any meeting of the Board at which the Board is
reasonably expected to consider any Alternative Transaction Proposal. Any
material amendment (including the form, amount and timing of payment of
consideration) to any Alternative Transaction Proposal will be deemed to be a
new Alternative Transaction Proposal for the purposes of this _Section 7.21_.

  



  

(d) _Changes of Recommendation_. Except as provided in _Section
7.21(e)_ below, neither the Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
withdraw or qualify (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Purchaser), or
fail to make the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by
the Board or any committee thereof of this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (B) recommend, adopt or approve any
Alternative Transaction Proposal, (C) publicly make any recommendation in
connection with an Alternative Transaction Proposal other than a
recommendation against such proposal, or (D) if an Alternative Transaction
Proposal shall have been publicly announced or disclosed, if so requested by
Purchaser, fail to recommend against such Alternative Transaction Proposal or
fail to reaffirm the approval, recommendation and declaration of advisability
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on or
prior to the fourth (4th) Business Day after the Alternative Transaction
Proposal shall have been publicly announced or disclosed (any action described
in this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_
") or (ii) approve or recommend or allow Seller or any of its Affiliates to
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
agreement, arrangement or understanding (A) relating to any Alternative
Transaction Proposal or any offer or proposal that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction Proposal or (B) requiring it
(or that would require it) to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 60| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, solely in response to a Superior Proposal, the Board may make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal in accordance
with _Section 9.01(h)_ , only if all of the following conditions in clauses
(i) through (iv) are met:

  



  

(i) a Superior Proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and
continues to be a Superior Proposal;

  



  

(ii) Seller shall have (A) provided to Purchaser four (4) Business
Days' prior written notice, which notice shall state expressly (1) that it
has received a Superior Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal (including the consideration offered therein (and the
portion thereof attributable to the Brand Business) and the identity of the
Person or group of Persons making the Superior Proposal), and shall have
contemporaneously provided copies of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements with the Person or group of Persons making such Superior Proposal
(the " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") (it being understood and agreed
that any material amendment to the financial terms or any other material term
of such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new four (4)
Business Day period) and (3) that it intends to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change and the manner in which it intends to do so or that it
intends to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.01(h)_ in
order to enter into the Alternative Acquisition Agreement, as applicable, and
(B) prior to making such Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.01(h)_ , as applicable, to the extent
requested by Purchaser, engaged in good faith negotiations with Purchaser
during such four (4) Business Day period to amend this Agreement in such a
manner that the Alternative Acquisition Agreement ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal;

  



  

(iii) the Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior
Proposal and taking into account any revised terms offered by Purchaser, the
failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 9.01(h)_ , as applicable, is inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; and

  



  

(iv) Seller shall have complied with _Section 7.21(a)_ and shall not
have breached any of the other provisions set forth in this _Section 7.21_.

7.22 Gaiam-FFL APA. Seller shall not, without the prior written consent
of Purchaser (which consent may be withheld in its reasonable
discretion), terminate, amend, modify or supplement the Gaiam-FFL APA in any
material respect. Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree that in the
event FFL shall fail to close the transactions contemplated by the Gaiam-FFL
APA, or otherwise fail to fund the Net Closing Cash Consideration, as defined
in the Gaiam-FFL APA on the Closing Date, (a) Seller shall have the right to
(i) terminate the Gaiam-FFL APA, and (ii) to cause the Brand Companies to
transfer and assign the Acquired Assets, as defined in the Gaiam-FFL APA, to
Seller immediately prior to the sale and transfer of the Purchased Interests
to Purchaser hereunder, and such transfer and assignment shall not result in
any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of Seller or the Brand
Companies hereunder; (b) during the sixty day period following the Closing,
Seller and Purchaser will work together in good faith to allow Seller to sell
and/or collect such Acquired Assets in the ordinary course of business, and
such sale shall not be subject to any restrictive covenants set forth herein;
and (c) following the Closing, the Brand Companies shall grant to Seller a
limited royalty-free, sublicensable, worldwide license to use, reproduce and
display the Material Registered Company Intellectual Property solely as
necessary to market and sell and/or collect the Acquired Assets and such
license shall be sublicensable to any subsequent purchaser or assignee of the
Acquired Assets solely as necessary to market and sell any Acquired Assets
that are inventory bearing any Material Registered Company Intellectual
Property. For the avoidance of doubt, this limited license is granted
conditionally and solely to allow Seller (i) to market and sell Acquired
Assets that are inventory and (ii) to sell the entirety of the Acquired Assets
to a purchaser thereof, in each case, until such time as Purchaser, Seller
and the Brand Companies identify a third party to fill FFL's role as a
Licensee and purchase the Acquired Assets.

Article IX 
 TERMINATION

  



  

9.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing Date:

  



  

(a) by mutual written consent of Purchaser and Seller;

  



  

(b) by either Purchaser or Seller if the Contemplated Transactions
shall not have been consummated within ninety (90) days following the date
hereof (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided, however,_ that the Parties may
mutually consent in writing to extend the Outside Date for any reason and, if
any Person shall initiate a Proceeding seeking to enjoin the Contemplated
Transactions and succeed in obtaining a temporary restraining order or
injunction, the Outside Date shall be automatically extended for
an additional thirty (30) days and thereafter, at Seller's or Purchaser's
option, for up to two (2) additional thirty (30)-day periods (such extended
date shall then be the " _Outside Date_ "). The right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 9.01(b)_ shall not be available to any Party
whose willful breach of any material obligation under this Agreement has been
the principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on
or before the Outside Date;

  



  

(c) by either Purchaser or Seller, if a Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction shall have issued a nonappealable final Judgment or
taken any other action having the effect of permanently restraining,
enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the Contemplated Transactions; 
_provided, however,_ that the Party seeking to terminate pursuant to this
_Section 9.01(c)_ shall have complied with its obligations under _Section
7.04_;

  



  

(d) by Purchaser, if Seller shall have breached or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants, or other
agreements contained in this Agreement (other than _Section 7.21(a)_ ), which
breach or failure to perform would cause the conditions to the obligations of
Purchaser at the Closing to not be satisfied by the Outside Date and which
breach or failure, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured prior
to the earlier of (i) the Outside Date and (ii) 10 calendar days following
receipt by Seller of written notice of such breach or failure from Purchaser,
with specific reference to the alleged facts underlying such breach or
failure and the conclusion it would lead to such conditions not being met;

  



  

(e) by Seller, if Purchaser shall have breached or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants, or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
would cause the conditions to the obligations of Seller at the Closing to not
be satisfied by the Outside Date and which breach or failure, if capable of
being cured, shall not have been cured prior to the earlier of (i) the
Outside Date or (ii) 10 calendar days following receipt by Purchaser of
written notice of such breach or failure from Seller, with specific reference
to the alleged facts underlying such breach or failure and the conclusion it
would lead to such conditions not being met;

  



  

(f) by Purchaser, if Seller shall have breached in any material
respect any of its obligations under _Section 7.21(a)_ ;

  



  

(g) by Purchaser, if Seller, the Board or any committee thereof, for
any reason, shall have (i) effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, or (ii)
approved or recommended any Alternative Transaction Proposal; or

  



  

(h) by Seller, if: (i) Seller shall have received a Superior
Proposal; (ii) Seller shall have complied in all material respects with its
obligations under _Section 7.21_; (iii) the Board approves, and Seller,
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement, enters into, such
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; and
(iv) concurrently with such termination, Seller pays to Purchaser the
Termination Fee.

  



  

   

 | 66| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

9.02 Termination Procedures. If Purchaser or Seller exercises their
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_, it shall
deliver to the other Party a written notice specifying a reasonably detailed
basis for termination; _provided, however_ , that (i) Purchaser's right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)_ shall be subject to the
cure period set forth in _Section 9.01(d)_ and (ii) Seller's right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(e)_  shall be subject to
the cure period set forth in such Section _9.01(e)_.

  



  

9.03 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated and the
Contemplated Transactions are abandoned as described in _Section 9.01_, this
Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force and effect and
there shall be no Liability on the part of any Party or any of its
Affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, partners, members or
Representatives, except (i) that the provisions of _Section 4.07_, _Section
5.20_, _Section 6.07_, _Section 7.03_, _Section 7.12_, this _Section
9.03_, _Section 9.04_ and _Article XI_ shall survive termination, and (ii)
nothing herein shall relieve any Party from Liability for any intentional and
material breach of this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive termination of this Agreement as provided therein. Purchaser shall
promptly cause to be returned to Seller, the Company or their designated
Representatives or certified destroyed by Purchaser, all documents and
information obtained in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions and all documents and information obtained in connection with
Purchaser's investigation of the Company's business, operations, and legal
affairs, including any copies made by Purchaser or its Representatives of any
such documents or information and take all other such action as required by
the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

9.04 Termination Fee.

  



  

(a) In the event that:

  



  

(i) Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.01(f)_ or _9.01(g)_ ;

  



  

(ii) (1) this Agreement is terminated by (x) Seller or Purchaser
pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)_ , and Seller did not have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(e)_, or (y) by
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)_ and prior to such termination, an
Alternative Transaction Proposal has been made and (2) within nine (9) months
of such termination, Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (including any Brand
Company) enters into a definitive agreement with any third party to
consummate, or consummates, an Alternative Transaction;

  



  

(iii) (1) this Agreement is terminated by (x) Seller or Purchaser
pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)_ , and Seller did not have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(e)_, or (y) by
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)_ and prior to such termination, no
Alternative Transaction Proposal has been made and (2) within six (6) months
of such termination, Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (including any Brand
Company) enters into a definitive agreement with any third party to
consummate, or consummates, an Alternative Transaction; or

  



  

   

 | 67| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iv) Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(h)_;

  



  

then, Seller shall pay Purchaser a one-time fee equal to $5,010,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ "), which Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy available at law or in equity to Purchaser for a termination of this
Agreement which results in the payment of the Termination Fee. Any amounts
due under this _Section 9.04(a)_ shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day
funds on the date of such termination or entry into such definitive
agreement, as applicable, to an account provided in writing by Purchaser to
Seller. The Parties agree that the liquidated damages described in this
_Section 9.04_ are based in part on the damages which the Purchaser would
suffer on account of the failure of the Closing to occur under the
circumstances specified (which damages the parties acknowledge and agree are
incapable of exact determination of amount). It is therefore understood and
agreed that such liquidated damages amount represents the Parties' reasonable
estimate of actual damages and do not constitute a penalty.

  



  

(b) Interest and Costs; Other Remedies. Each of Seller and Purchaser
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 9.04 _are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that,
without these agreements, neither Purchaser nor Seller would have entered
into this Agreement. Accordingly, in the event that Seller shall fail to pay
the Termination Fee when due, and in order to obtain such payment, Purchaser
commences a suit which results in a judgment against Seller for
such Termination Fee, then Seller shall pay to Purchaser its costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses of enforcement) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts owed at the
prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as published in the Wall Street
Journal.

Party, as applicable, learned of such Damages, cause of action or claim.

  



  

(f) The Cap Amount set forth in _Section 10.04(b)_ shall not apply
to (i) any indemnification claim made by a Purchaser Party pursuant to
_Section 10.01(d)_ , _Section 10.01(e)_ , _Section 10.01(g_ ) and _Section
10.01(h)_ , (ii) fraud in connection with any breach of a representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement and (iii) any indemnification claim made
by a Seller Party pursuant to _Section 10.02(c)_.

  



  

(g) No Purchaser Party or Seller Party shall be entitled to recover
any Damages or other amounts relating to any matter arising under one
provision of this Agreement to the extent that such Purchaser Party or Seller
Party (or other Purchaser Parties in the event of a Purchaser Party, or other
Seller Parties in the event of a Seller Party), as applicable, has already
recovered such Damages or amounts with respect to such matter pursuant to
other provisions of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the operation of _Section 2.05_ and _Section 2.06_ is an
exclusive remedy in respect of the assets and liabilities and related items
taken into account in connection with the determination of Final Net Closing
Cash Consideration, and to the extent any breach of a representation or
warranty and the Damages resulting therefrom were specifically taken
into account in such determination, Purchaser shall not be entitled to any
additional recourse in respect thereof under this _Article X_.

  



  

10.05 No Liability of Representatives, Lenders, or Financing Sources. No
Party shall have any recourse whatsoever against (a) any Representatives of
the other Party, or (b) any of the assets of any of the Persons identified in
subsection (a), in connection with any indemnification claim or any other
claim of any nature in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, neither Seller or Affiliates nor either of their respective
Representatives shall have any rights or claims against any lender or
financing source with respect to the Debt Financing (including without
limitation any lender or financing source that is a party to the Debt
Commitment Letters or Fee Letter) in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and no such
lender or financing source shall have any rights or claims against Seller,
its Affiliates or either of their respective Representatives in connection
with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, in each case whether at law or in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise; _provided_ , that, following the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the foregoing shall not limit
the rights of the parties to the Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment
Letters.

10.06 Indemnification Claims.

  



  

(a) If Purchaser or Seller (the Party seeking indemnification, the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") wishes to assert an indemnification claim in
accordance with this _Article X_, then the Indemnified Party shall deliver to
the other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") a written notice (a " _Claim
Notice_ ") setting forth:

  



  

(i) the specific representation, warranty, or covenant alleged to
have been breached by the Indemnifying Party or other indemnifiable
matter described in _Section 10.01_ or _Section 10.02_ , as applicable;

  



  

(ii) a reasonably detailed description of the facts and circumstances
giving rise to the alleged breach of such representation, warranty or
covenant or other indemnifiable matter described in _Section 10.01_ or
_Section 10.02_ , as applicable; and

  



  

(iii) a reasonably detailed description of, and a reasonable estimate
of the total amount of, the Damages incurred or expected to be incurred by
the Indemnified Party as a result of such alleged breach or other
indemnifiable matter described in _Section 10.01_ or _Section 10.02_ , as
applicable.

  



  

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall object to the
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or
claims specified in any Claim Notice (other than a Third Party Claim, which
is addressed in _Section 10.07_ ), the Indemnifying Party shall, within
twenty (20) days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such Claim Notice,
deliver to the Indemnified Party a notice to such effect, specifying in
reasonable detail the basis for such objection, and the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party shall, within the 20 day period beginning on the date
of receipt by the Indemnified Party of such objection and prior to submitting
such dispute in accordance with _Section 11.11_ , attempt in good faith to
agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such
claims to which the Indemnifying Party shall have so objected. If the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall succeed in reaching
agreement on their respective rights with respect to any of such claims,
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly prepare and
sign a memorandum of agreement setting forth such agreement. Should the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party be unable to agree as to any
particular item or items or amount or amounts within such time period, then
the Indemnified Party shall be permitted to submit such dispute in accordance
with _Section 11.11_.

  



  

(c) Claims for Damages specified in any Claim Notice to which an
Indemnifying Party shall not object in writing within twenty (20) days
of receipt of such Claim Notice (other than a Third Party Claim, which is
addressed in _Section 10.07_ ), claims for Damages covered by a memorandum of
agreement of the nature described in _Section 10.06(b)_ , and claims for
Damages the validity and amount of which have been the subject of judicial
determination as described in Sections _10.06(b)_ and _11.11_ or shall have
been settled or determined as described in _Section 10.07_ , are hereinafter
referred to, collectively, as " _Agreed Claims_ ". Within 10 Business Days of
the determination of the amount of any Agreed Claim (or at such other time as
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall agree), the
Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to the
Agreed Claim by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the bank
account or accounts designated by the Indemnified Party in a notice to the
Indemnifying Party not less than two Business Days prior to such payment.

10.07 Defense of Third Party Claims.

  



  

(a) If an Indemnified Party receives notice or otherwise obtains
knowledge of any Proceeding commenced or threatened by a third party, other
than any claim relating to Taxes (such Tax-related matters being governed by
_Section 7.10_ ) (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against the Indemnified
Party that the Indemnified Party actually knows may give rise to an
indemnification claim against the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified
Party shall reasonably promptly after such actual knowledge deliver to the
Indemnifying Party a written notice (the " _Third Party Claim Notice_ ")
describing the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail. The delivery of such
written notice by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party shall be a
condition precedent to any Liability on the part of the Indemnifying Party
under this _Article X_ with respect to such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
that any failure to timely notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall
have the right, at its option, to assume the defense of any such Third Party
Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party; _provided_
, that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim only to the extent the Indemnifying Party acknowledges
in writing its indemnity obligation and assumes and holds the Indemnified
Party harmless from and against the full amount of any Damages resulting
therefrom; and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume
control of such defense and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel
retained by the Indemnified Party if (A) such Third Party Claim is reasonably
foreseeable to result in Damages which are more than the remaining Cap Amount
at the time such claim is submitted by the Indemnified Party; (B) such Third
Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding,
action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (C) such Third Party Claim
seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; (D)
the Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by counsel that a
reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party; (E) the Indemnified
Party reasonably believes an adverse determination with respect to the
action, lawsuit, investigation, proceeding or other claim giving rise to such
claim for indemnification would be detrimental to or injure the Indemnified
Party's reputation or future business prospects; or (F) upon petition by the
Indemnified Party, the appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party
failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such Third Party
Claim.

  



  

(b) If the Indemnifying Party is entitled to and elects in writing
(which writing shall also contain the acknowledgement referenced in  _Section
10.07(a)(i)_ ) within 20 days of receipt of the Third Party Claim Notice to
assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim, then:

  



  

(i) the Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to
participate in such defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party
and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying
Party shall not be required to pay or otherwise indemnify the Indemnified
Party against any fees or expenses of such counsel incurred on behalf of the
Indemnified Party in connection with such Third Party Claim following the
Indemnifying Party's election to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim,  _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees and
expenses of such counsel if (A) the Indemnifying Party subsequently ceases to
control the defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided further_ that in such
event, the Indemnifying Party shall only be responsible for such fees and
expenses from and after the date on which the Indemnifying Party ceases to
control the defense of such Third Party Claim, or (B) the named parties to
any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall
have been advised in writing by such counsel that there may be one or more
legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are not available to
the Indemnifying Party, or available to the Indemnifying Party the assertion
of which would be adverse to the interests of the Indemnified Party;

  



  

(ii) subject to the entry into a confidentiality agreement acceptable
to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall make
reasonably available to the Indemnifying Party all nonprivileged books,
records, and other documents and materials that are under the direct or
indirect control of the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Party's
Representatives and that the Indemnifying Party considers necessary or
desirable for the defense of such Third Party Claim;

  



  

   

 | 73| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate as reasonably
requested by the Indemnifying Party in the defense of such Third Party Claim;

  



  

(iv) the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect
to or pay or settle such Third Party Claim so long as the Indemnifying Party
is reasonably contesting any such Third Party Claim in good faith; provided,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to pay or settle any such Third Party Claim if (A) it shall waive any
right to indemnity therefor by the Indemnifying Party or (B) the Indemnifying
Party shall have consented in writing to such payment or settlement; and

  



  

(v) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle, adjust, or
compromise such Third Party Claim, on such terms as it may deem
appropriate, without the consent or approval of the Indemnified Party or any
other Person, unless such settlement, adjustment or compromise (i) does not
include a full, unconditional and complete release by all of the Persons
asserting such Third Party Claim of Purchaser or other applicable Purchaser
Party from all Liability with respect to such Third Party Claim, (ii) is not
entirely indemnifiable by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Article
X_, or, and (iii) imposes any injunctive relief or other restrictions of any
kind or nature on the Indemnified Party (or any Purchaser Party or Seller
Party, as applicable), in which case the Indemnifying Party shall not enter
into such settlement, adjustment, or compromise of such Third Party Claim
without Purchaser's or other applicable Purchaser Party's prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

  



  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim, then (i) the Indemnified Party shall defend such
Third Party Claim in a commercially reasonable manner; _provided, however,_
that the Indemnified Party shall not settle, adjust, or compromise such Third
Party Claim, or admit any Liability with respect to such Third Party Claim,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (ii)
the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably cooperate as reasonably requested by
the Indemnified Party in the defense of such Third Party Claim and make
reasonably available to the Indemnified Party all nonprivileged books,
records, and other documents and materials that are under the direct or
indirect control of the Indemnifying Party or any of the Indemnifying Party's
Representatives and that the Indemnified Party reasonably considers necessary
or desirable for the defense of such Third Party Claim.

  



  

(d) In all events, the Representation and Warranty Policy Insurer
and its agents and advisors shall be permitted to associate effectively with
any Party in the defense of any matter which might reasonably involve Loss (as
defined in the Representation and Warranty Policy).

  



  

(e) Without limiting the other rights of Seller hereunder, the
Representation and Warranty Policy Insurer shall be entitled to
participate, at its sole cost and expense, in any Third Party Claim covered
by the Representation and Warranty Policy to the extent set forth in the
Representation and Warranty Policy, but only to the extent such participation
is expressly required by the Representation and Warranty Policy.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 10.07_ , the
provisions of this _Section 10.07_ shall be subject to the rights of the
Representation and Warranty Policy Insurer under the Representation and
Warranty Policy with respect to any Third Party Claims covered by the
Representation and Warranty Policy.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 10.07_ to the
contrary, _Section 7.10_ shall govern for purposes of any Third Party
Claim that is a Tax Controversy

  



  

   

 | 74| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

10.08 Exclusive Remedy. Except (a) in the case of (i) fraud by a member
of the Seller Knowledge Group with respect to a representation or warranty in
_Article IV_ or _Article V_ or (ii) fraud by a member of the Purchaser
Knowledge Group with respect to a representation or warranty in _Article
VI_, (b) the dispute resolution provisions set forth in _Section 2.06 _
relating to the calculation of the Final Net Closing Cash Consideration, (c)
the right to the Termination Fee pursuant to  _Section 9.04_ , and (d) the
right to specific performance in accordance with _Section 11.14_ , in the
event of a breach by any Party of a covenant under this Agreement, the right
of each Party to assert indemnification claims and receive
indemnification payments pursuant to _Section 7.10_ (with respect to Tax
matters) and this _Article X_ shall, from and after the Closing Date, be the
sole and exclusive right and remedy exercisable by such Party with respect to
any breach by any other Party of any covenant, representation, warranty, or
otherwise under this Agreement, relating to this Agreement or relating to the
Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

10.09 Characterization of Indemnification Payment. Any payment made

assert, any right of contribution or right to indemnity or any other right or
remedy against any Brand Company in connection with any indemnification
obligation or any other Liability to which Seller may become subject under
this Agreement or otherwise in connection with any of Contemplated
Transactions; _provided_ that this waiver shall not apply to or limit any of
Seller's rights under or pursuant to any Collateral Agreement.

  



  

Article XI 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS

  



  

11.01 Disclosure Schedule. Each section of the Disclosure Schedule
qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or
covenant, and each disclosure set forth therein shall qualify any other
representation or warranty to the extent that the applicability of such
disclosure to such other representation or warranty is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule. The
Disclosure Schedule is qualified in its entirety by reference to specific
provisions of the Agreement, and is not intended to constitute, and shall not
be construed as constituting, any representation or warranty or covenant of
Seller, except as and to the extent expressly provided in the Agreement.
Inclusion of information in the Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed as
an admission that such information is material to Seller or any Brand Company
or its assets, liabilities, financial condition, results, business and/or
operations. The fact that any item of information is contained in the
Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed to mean that such information is
required to be disclosed by the Agreement. Such information shall not be used
as a basis for interpreting the term "material," "materially" or "materiality"
in the Agreement. References to any document in the Disclosure Schedule do
not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the
document itself. Capitalized terms used but not defined in the Disclosure
Schedule shall have the same meanings given them in this Agreement.

  



  

11.02 Exclusivity of Agreement. The Parties have voluntarily agreed to
define their rights, liabilities, and obligations respecting the
subject matter of this Agreement exclusively in contract pursuant to the
express terms and provisions of this Agreement; and the Parties expressly
disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not
expressly set forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, the Parties each hereby
acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the justifiable expectations of
sophisticated parties derived from arm's-length negotiations; all Parties
specifically acknowledge that no Party has any special relationship with
another party that would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary
acquiror and an ordinary target in an arm's-length transaction. The sole and
exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (including any representations and warranties set forth herein)
shall be those remedies set forth herein.

an inducement to enter into this Agreement), may be made only against the
Persons that are expressly identified as Parties; and no officer,
director, shareholder, employee or affiliate of any Party (including any
Person negotiating or executing this Agreement on behalf of a Party) shall
have any liability or obligation with respect to this Agreement or with
respect to any claim or cause of action (whether in contract or tort) that
may arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including a representation or warranty made in
or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this

11.11 Governing Law; Venue.

  



  

(a) This Agreement, and all claims of causes of action (whether in

Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement
or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed solely
by the internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflict-

Persons that have committed to provide or otherwise entered into agreements in
connection with the Debt Financing or other financings in connection with the

11.14 Remedies. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party shall be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy shall not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of
it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, each Party
acknowledges and agrees that, except to the extent prohibited in the event the
Termination Fee becomes due and payable to the Purchaser pursuant to _Section
9.04_ , the other Party shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, without
having to post a bond. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting
of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that the other Party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in
equity.

11.17 Waivers; Terminations. Recognizing that Brownstein Hyatt Farber
Schreck, LLP has acted as legal counsel to Seller and certain of
its Affiliates, and the Company prior to the Closing, and that Brownstein
Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP intends to act as legal counsel to Seller and
certain of their respective Affiliates (which will no longer include the
Company) after the Closing, each of Purchaser, the Company and the Company\'s
Subsidiaries hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its
Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with
Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP representing Seller and/or any of
Seller\'s Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to
Purchaser, or any of the Brand Companies or the Contemplated Transactions
(including in respect of litigation). In addition, all communications
involving attorney-client confidences between Seller, its Affiliates, the
Brand Companies, on the one hand, and Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP on
the other hand, in the course of the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be
attorney-client confidences that belong solely to Seller and its respective
Affiliates (and not the Brand Companies). Accordingly, Purchaser agrees that
the Brand Companies shall not have access to any such communications, or to
the files of Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP and relating to their
engagement in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, whether or not
the Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (a) Seller and its Affiliates (and not
the Brand Companies) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client
privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of the Brand Companies
shall be a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of Brownstein Hyatt
Farber Schreck, LLP in respect of such engagement constitute property of the
client, only Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Brand Companies) shall
hold such property rights and (c) Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP shall
not have any duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to any of the Brand Companies by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP and
the Brand Companies or otherwise. This _Section 11.17_ is for the benefit of
Seller and Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP, and Brownstein Hyatt Farber
Schreck, LLP is an intended third-party beneficiary of this _Section 11.17_.
This _Section 11.17_ shall be irrevocable, and no term of this _Section
11.17_ may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written consent
of Seller.

  



  

11.18 Non-Recourse. No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, financial
advisor, accountant, advisor, agent, attorney or other representative of
Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities
of Seller or Purchaser (as applicable) under this Agreement or the Collateral
Agreements or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except that nothing in this
_Section 11.18_ shall limit the express obligations of a Party under this
Agreement or the Collateral Agreements.

  



  

11.19 Time of Essence. With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

  



  

11.20 Further Assurances. From and after the Closing, upon the request of
a Party, each other Party shall do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such
further acts, assurances, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and other
instruments and papers as may be reasonably required or appropriate to carry
out the Contemplated Transactions, including using commercially reasonable
efforts to provide (at Purchaser's sole cost) any information requested by
Purchaser pertaining to the Company Intellectual Property, to the extent such
information is readily available and within Seller's possession, in order for
Purchaser (and not Seller) to prosecute, maintain and enforce the Company
Intellectual and to register the same in any appropriate Governmental Entity;
_provided, however,_ that Purchaser shall use its best efforts to aggregate
all such requests for information or action from Seller and to avoid making
isolated requested for the same.

11.21 Parent Guaranty.

  



  

(a) Parent irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the prompt,
complete and punctual payment of all payment obligations of Purchaser
under this Agreement (" _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). In furtherance of the
foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties hereto
agree that (i) Parent's guaranty under this _Section 11.21_ (this " _Guaranty_
") is a guaranty of payment when due and not collectability; (ii) this
Guaranty is a primary obligation of Parent and not merely a contract of
surety; and (iii) payment by Parent of a portion, but not all, of the
Guaranteed Obligations shall in no way limit, affect, modify or abridge any
liability of Parent for any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations which have
not been paid or performed.

  



  

(b) Seller may recover from Parent the full amount of any Guaranteed
Obligation on demand, but only after Purchaser has breached or defaulted on
such Guaranteed Obligation. Nothing herein shall require Seller to first seek
or exhaust any remedy against Purchaser, its successors and assigns, or any
other person obligated with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations. It is
agreed that Seller may, upon any breach or default of Purchaser of a
Guaranteed Obligation, or at any time thereafter, make demand upon Parent and
receive payment and performance of such Guaranteed Obligation, with or
without notice or demand for payment or performance by Purchaser, its
successors or assigns, or any other person. Suit may be brought and maintained
against Parent, at Seller's election, without joinder of Purchaser or any
other person as parties thereto.

  



  

(c) Parent agrees that its obligations to Seller under this Guaranty
shall be primary, absolute, continuing and unconditional (other than a
discharge of Parent with respect to any Guaranteed Obligation as a result of
performance of such Guaranteed Obligation in accordance with its terms or as
a result of defenses to the performance of such Guaranteed Obligation that
would be available to Purchaser hereunder), irrespective of and unaffected by
any of the following actions or circumstances (regardless of any notice to or
consent of Parent): (i) the genuineness, validity, regularity and
enforceability of this Agreement or any other document executed in
connection herewith; (ii) any extension, renewal, amendment, change, waiver
or other modification of this Agreement or any other document executed in
connection herewith; (iii) Purchaser's voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy,
assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, or similar
proceedings affecting Purchaser or any of its assets; or (iv) any other action
or circumstances which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor (other than as otherwise
provided in this _Section 11.21(c)_).

  



  

(d) To the extent the waiver of Parent's rights of subrogation,
reimbursement and contribution as set forth herein is found by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any reason, Parent's rights
of subrogation and reimbursement against Purchaser, shall be junior and
subordinate to any rights Seller may have against Purchaser.

  



  

(e) Any modification, limitation or discharge of all or any part of
the Guaranteed Obligations arising out of or by virtue of any
bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding for relief of Purchaser
under Applicable Law initiated by or against Purchaser shall not modify,
limit, lessen, reduce, impair, discharge or otherwise affect Parent's
obligations hereunder in any manner whatsoever. If at any time any payment or
portion thereof of any Guaranteed Obligation, whether or not made by or for
the account of Parent, is set aside by any court or trustee having
jurisdiction as a voidable preference or fraudulent conveyance or must
otherwise be restored or returned by Seller to Purchaser under any
insolvency, bankruptcy or other Applicable Laws or as a result of any
dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of Purchaser or upon or as a
result of the appointment of any receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or
trustee or similar officer of Purchaser or any substantial part of Purchaser's
properties or assets, or in connection with any compromise or settlement
relating to any of the above, Parent hereby agrees that this Guaranty shall
continue and remain in full force and effect or be reinstated, as the case
may be, all as though such payment(s) had not been made.
