<P align="center"><FONT size="2">1998 OPTION PLAN FOR MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS</FONT>

<P align="center"><FONT size="2">As Adopted November&nbsp;11, 1998<BR>
Amended And Restated Through April&nbsp;28, 1999<BR>
And Amended on May&nbsp;31, 2002</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>1.&nbsp;PURPOSE</B>. The purpose of the Plan is to provide incentives to retain
and motivate eligible persons whose present and potential contributions are
important to the success of the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate
of the Company), by offering those persons an opportunity to participate in the
Company&#146;s future performance through awards of Options. Capitalized terms are
defined in Section&nbsp;21 if they are not otherwise defined in other sections of
the Plan.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>2.&nbsp;SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN.</B>
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1 Number of Shares Available. Subject to Sections&nbsp;2.2 and 16, the total
number of Shares reserved and available for grant and issuance pursuant to
Options under the Plan shall be 2,000,000 Shares. Subject to Sections&nbsp;2.2 and
16, Shares will again be available for grant and issuance in connection with
future Options under the Plan if the Shares: (a)&nbsp;are subject to issuance upon
exercise of an Option but cease to be subject to the Option for any reason
other than exercise of the Option; (b)&nbsp;are issued on exercise of an Option but
are repurchased by the Company at the original issue price because the Shares
are unvested at the time of the Participant&#146;s Termination. At all times the
Company will reserve and keep available a sufficient number of Shares to
satisfy the requirements of all outstanding Options granted under the Plan.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2 Adjustment of Shares. If the number of outstanding Shares is changed
by a stock dividend, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split,
subdivision, combination, reclassification or similar change in the capital
structure of the Company, without consideration, then (a)&nbsp;the number of Shares
reserved for issuance under the Plan, (b)&nbsp;the Exercise Prices of and number of
Shares subject to outstanding Options, and (c)&nbsp;the number of Shares subject to
other outstanding Options, will be proportionately adjusted, subject to any
required action by the Board or the stockholders of the Company and compliance
with applicable securities laws; provided that fractions of a Share will not be
issued but will either be paid in cash at Fair Market Value, or will be rounded
up to the nearest Share, as determined by the Committee; and provided further
that the Exercise Price of any Option may not be decreased to below the par
value of the Shares.
</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.&nbsp;ELIGIBILITY</B>. Only persons who commence providing services to the
Company or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company as a result of a
merger or acquisition by the Company or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate of
the Company may receive Options under the Plan. Options may be granted to such
individuals only for a period of up to eighteen months following the closing of
the merger or acquisition. Options may be granted to employees, officers,
consultants, independent contractors and advisors of the Company or any Parent,
Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company. Options awarded to Insiders or to
other individuals who are officers of the Company may not exceed in the
aggregate forty-five percent (45%) of all Shares that are reserved for grant
under the Plan and employees who are not officers of Intuit must receive at
least fifty-one percent (51%) of all Shares that are reserved for grant under
the Plan. Only consultants, contractors and advisors that render bona fide
services not in connection with the offer and sale of securities in a
capital-raising transaction may be granted Options under the Plan. A person
may be granted more than one Option under the Plan.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">that the Committee or an officer of the Company (pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.1(b))
has from time to time approved, and will comply with and be subject to the
terms and conditions of the Plan.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.2 Date of Grant. The date of grant of an Option will be the date on
which the Committee makes the determination to grant the Option, unless a later
date is otherwise specified by the Committee. The Stock Option Agreement, and
a copy of the Plan and the current Prospectus for the Plan (plus any additional
documents required to be delivered under applicable laws), will be delivered to
the Participant within a reasonable time after the Option is granted. The
Plan, the Prospectus and other documents may delivered in any manner (including
electronic distribution or posting) that meets applicable legal requirements.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.3 Exercise Period and Expiration Date. Options will be exercisable
within the times or upon the occurrence of events determined by the Committee
and set forth in the Stock Option Agreement, subject to the provisions of
Section&nbsp;5.6, and subject to Company policies established by the Committee (or
by individuals to whom the Committee has delegated responsibility) from time to
time with respect to vesting during leaves of absences. The Stock Option
Agreement shall set forth the last date that the option may be exercised (the
&#147;Expiration Date&#148;). The Committee also may provide for Options to become
exercisable at one time or from time to time, periodically or otherwise, in
such number of Shares or percentage of Shares subject to the Option as the
Committee determines.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.4 Exercise Price. The Exercise Price of an Option will be determined by
the Committee when the Option is granted and may not be less than Fair Market
Value (and not less than the par value of the Shares); of the Shares on the
date of grant. Payment for the Shares purchased must be made in accordance
with Section&nbsp;6 of the Plan and the Stock Option Agreement.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.5 Procedures for Exercise. A Participant may exercise Options by
following the procedures established by the Company&#146;s Stock Administration
Department, as communicated and made available to Participants through the
stock pages on the Intuit Legal Department intranet web site, and/or through
the Company&#146;s electronic mail system.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp; Vesting. Any Option granted to a Participant will cease to vest on the
Participant&#146;s Termination Date, if the Participant is Terminated for any reason
other than &#147;total disability&#148; (as defined in this Section&nbsp;5.6(a)) or death (or
his or her death occurs within three months of Termination). Any Option
granted on or after May&nbsp;31, 2002 to a Participant who is an employee will vest
as to 100% of the Shares subject to such Option, if the Participant is
Terminated due to &#147;total disability&#148; or death (or his or her death occurs
within three months of Termination) provided that the Participant is either an
employee who has been actively employed by the Company or any Subsidiary for
one year or more or a director. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;5.6(a) &#147;total
disability&#148; shall mean: (A) (i)&nbsp;for so long as such definition is used for
purposes of the Company&#146;s group life insurance and accidental death and
dismemberment plan or group long term disability plan, that the Participant is
unable to perform each of the material duties of any gainful occupation for
which the Participant is or becomes reasonably fitted by training, education or
experience and which total disability is in fact preventing the Participant
from engaging in any employment or occupation for wage or profit; or, (ii)&nbsp;if
such definition has changed, such other definition of &#147;total disability&#148; as
determined under the Company&#146;s group life insurance and accidental death and
dismemberment plan or group long term disability plan; and (B)&nbsp;the Company
shall have received from the Participant&#146;s primary physician a certification
that the Participant&#146;s total disability is likely to be permanent. Any Option
granted to an employee on or after May&nbsp;31, 2002 who is Terminated by the
Company, or any Subsidiary or Parent within one year following the date of a
Corporate Transaction (other than the merger or acquisition that made the
Participant eligible for Options under this Plan), will immediately vest as to
such number of Shares as the Participant would have been vested twelve months
after the date of Termination had the Participant remained employed for that
twelve month period.

written consent of Participant, impair any of Participant&#146;s rights under any
Option previously granted. The Committee may reduce the Exercise Price of
outstanding Options without the consent of Participants affected, by a written
notice to them; provided, however, that the exercise Price may not be reduced
below the minimum Exercise Price that would be permitted under Section&nbsp;5.4 of
the Plan for Options granted on the date the action is taken to reduce the

granted under the Plan, the Company may require the Participant to pay to the
Company an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state and local withholding
tax requirements prior to the delivery of any certificate(s) for the Shares.
If a payment in satisfaction of an Option is to be made in cash, the payment
will be net of an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, and local
withholding tax requirements.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.2 Stock Withholding. When, under applicable tax laws, a Participant
incurs tax liability in connection with the exercise or vesting of any Option
that is subject to tax withholding and the Participant is obligated to pay the
Company the amount required to be withheld, the Committee may, in its sole
discretion, allow the Participant to satisfy the minimum withholding tax
obligation by electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be
issued that number of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum
amount required to be withheld, determined on the date that the amount of tax
to be withheld is to be determined. All elections by a Participant to have
Shares withheld for this purpose shall be made in writing in a form acceptable
to the Committee.

a stockholder of the Company with respect to any Shares until the Shares are
issued to the Participant. After Shares are issued to the Participant, the
Participant will be a stockholder and have all the rights of a stockholder with
respect to the Shares; provided, however, that if the Shares are unvested, any
new, additional or different securities the Participant may become entitled to
receive with respect to the Shares by virtue of a stock dividend, stock split
or any other change in the corporate or capital structure of the Company will
be subject to the same restrictions as the unvested Shares; provided further,
that the Participant will have no right to retain such dividends or
distributions with respect to Shares that are repurchased at the Participant&#146;s
original Exercise Price pursuant to Section&nbsp;10.

by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or as consistent with the
Plan and specific Stock Option Agreement provisions relating thereto. During

the Participant.

Agreement a right to repurchase all or a portion of a Participant&#146;s Shares that
are not &#147;Vested&#148; (as defined in the Stock Option Agreement), following the
Participant&#146;s Termination, at any time within ninety days after the later of

Participant&#146;s Shares, the Committee may require the Participant to deposit all
certificates representing Shares, together with stock powers or other transfer
instruments approved by the Committee, appropriately endorsed in blank, with
the Company or an agent designated by the Company, to hold in escrow until such
restrictions have lapsed or terminated, and the Committee may cause a legend or
legends referencing such restrictions to be placed on the certificates. Any
Participant who is permitted to execute a promissory note as partial or full
consideration for the purchase of Shares under the Plan will be required to
pledge and deposit with the Company all or part of the Shares purchased as
collateral to secure the payment of the Participant&#146;s obligation to the Company
under the promissory note; provided, however, that the Committee may require or
accept other or additional forms of collateral to secure the payment of such
obligation and, in any event, the Company will have full recourse against the
Participant under the promissory note notwithstanding any pledge of the
Participant&#146;s Shares or other collateral. In connection with any pledge of the
Shares, the Participant will be required to execute and deliver a written
pledge agreement in a form that the Committee has from time to time approved.
The Shares purchased with the promissory note may be released from the pledge
on a pro rata basis as the promissory note is paid.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>13.&nbsp;SECURITIES LAW AND OTHER REGULATORY COMPLIANCE</B>. An Option shall not
be effective unless the Option is in compliance with all applicable state,
federal and foreign securities laws, rules and regulations of any governmental
body, and the requirements of any stock exchange or automated quotation system
on which the Shares may then be listed, as they are in effect on the date of
grant of the Option and also on the date of exercise or other issuance.
Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan, the Company shall have no
obligation to issue or deliver certificates for Shares under the Plan prior to
(a)&nbsp;obtaining any approvals from governmental agencies that the Company
determines are necessary or advisable, and/or (b)&nbsp;completion of any
registration or other qualification of such shares under any state, federal or
foreign law or ruling of any governmental body that the Company determines to
be necessary or advisable. The Company shall be under no obligation to
register the Shares with the SEC or to effect compliance with the registration,
qualification or listing requirements of any state, federal or foreign
securities laws, stock exchange or automated quotation system, and the Company
shall have no liability for any inability or failure to do so.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>14.&nbsp;NO OBLIGATION TO EMPLOY</B>. Nothing in the Plan or any Option granted
under the Plan shall confer or be deemed to confer on any Participant any right
to continue in the employ of, or to continue any other relationship with, the
Company or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company or limit in any
way the right of the Company or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate of the
Company to terminate Participant&#146;s employment or other relationship at any
time, with or without cause.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>15.&nbsp;EXCHANGE AND BUYOUT OF OPTIONS</B>. The Committee may, at any time or
from time to time, authorize the Company, with the consent of the respective
Participants, to issue new Options in exchange for the surrender and
cancellation of any or all outstanding Options. The Committee may at any time
buy from a Participant an Option previously granted with payment in cash,
Shares or other consideration, based on such terms and conditions as the
Committee and the Participant shall agree.

such successor corporation, if any, refuses to assume or replace the Options,
as provided above, pursuant to a transaction described in this Section&nbsp;16.1,
such Options shall expire in connection with the transaction at such time and
on such conditions as the Board shall determine. In the event such successor
corporation, if any, refuses to assume or replace the Awards, as provided
above, pursuant to a Corporate Transaction or if there is no successor
corporation due to a dissolution or liquidation of the Company, such Awards
shall immediately vest as to 100% of the Shares subject thereto at such time

at the closing of the transaction or at the time of dissolution or liquidation.

Participants under Section&nbsp;16.1, in the event of the occurrence of any

as provided in the applicable agreement or plan of merger, consolidation,

</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.3 Assumption of Options by the Company. The Company, from time to
time, also may substitute or assume outstanding awards granted by another
company, whether in connection with an acquisition of such other company or
otherwise, by either (a)&nbsp;granting an Option under the Plan in substitution of
such other company&#146;s award, or (b)&nbsp;assuming such award as if it had been
granted under the Plan if the terms of such assumed award could be applied to
an Option granted under the Plan. Such substitution or assumption shall be
permissible if the holder of the substituted or assumed award would have been
eligible to be granted an Option under the Plan if the other company had
applied the rules of the Plan to such grant. In the event the Company assumes
an award granted by another company, the terms and conditions of such award
shall remain unchanged (except that the exercise price and the number and
nature of Shares issuable upon exercise of any such option will be adjusted
appropriately pursuant to Section&nbsp;424(a) of the Code). In the event the
Company elects to grant a new Option rather than assuming an existing option,
such new Option may be granted with a similarly adjusted Exercise Price.

such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in
