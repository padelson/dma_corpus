SECTION 2.3 Surrender of Shares.

 

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Holdings shall designate a paying agent (the

Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a). At or prior to the
Closing, Holdings shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying
Agent, for the benefit (from and after the Effective Time) of the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to make all
payments pursuant to Section 2.3(b). Such funds may be invested by the Paying
Agent as directed by Holdings or, after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation; provided that (a) no such investment or losses thereon shall
affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company Common
Stock, and following any losses Holdings or the Surviving Corporation shall
promptly deposit (or cause to be deposited) additional funds to the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company in the amount of any
such losses, and (b) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of
the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or
guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor\'s Corporation, respectively. Any interest or income produced by such
investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Holdings, as
Holdings directs.

 

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of a
Certificate or a Book-Entry Share (other than Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares representing Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or to
remain outstanding pursuant to Section 2.1(c)), a letter of transmittal
(which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case
of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the
letter of transmittal) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such
Shares for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender to
the Paying Agent of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-5-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in
an amount equal to the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares (less any required
withholding taxes) and such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall then be
canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall
be a condition of payment that the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction
of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by, and in
accordance with, this Section 2.3(b), each Certificate and each Book-Entry
Share (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Shares to be
canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or to remain outstanding pursuant to
Section 2.1(c) or the Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II.

 

 

(c) At any time following the date that is twelve months after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) which have been deposited with the Paying Agent and which have not
been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general
creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable (without
interest) upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of
the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger
Consideration. None of Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub, the Company, Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. Any Merger Consideration remaining
unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property
of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interests of any
person previously entitled thereto. The Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this Article II in respect of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares that have been surrendered in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Shares represented thereby.

 

 

(d) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
of Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. After the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer shall be canceled and exchanged for

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-6-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth in, this Article II.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Holdings, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former holder of
Shares, Options, Restricted Shares, Stock Units or accounts under a Deferred
Compensation Plan pursuant to this Agreement any amount as may be required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Tax (as defined below) laws. To the extent that amounts are so
properly withheld by Holdings, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
as the case may be, and are paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity
in accordance with applicable law, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Shares, Options, Restricted Shares, Stock Units or accounts under a Deferred
Compensation Plan in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by Holdings, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case
may be.

 

 

(f) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the holder\'s compliance with the replacement requirements
established by the Paying Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by the
holder of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to the Certificate, the Paying Agent will
deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares represented
by such Certificate pursuant to this Article II.

 

 

SECTION 2.4 Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding
Shares (or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
Shares) shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, merger or any stock dividend or stock distribution
with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration shall be
correspondingly adjusted to reflect such change.

 

 

SECTION 2.5 Dissenting Shares.

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that
are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which
are held by holders of Shares who have not voted such Shares in favor of
adoption of the Merger Agreement and who have properly demanded and perfected
their rights to be paid the fair value of such Shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof
shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the
DGCL; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such holder's rights under Section
262 of the DGCL, such holder's Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, as set forth in Section 2.1 of this Agreement, without any
interest thereon.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-7-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The Company shall give Holdings (i) prompt notice of any appraisal
demands received by the Company, withdrawals thereof and any other
instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the
Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights (or offers or
attempts to settle the same) under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Holdings, make any payment with
respect to any such exercise of appraisal rights or offer to settle or settle
any such rights.

 

 

 

ARTICLE III

 

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

 

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Holdings and Merger Sub that,
(i) except as set forth on the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by the
Company to Holdings and Merger Sub prior to the execution of this
Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), it being understood and
agreed that each item in a particular section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule applies only to such section and to any other section to which its
relevance is reasonably apparent and (ii) other than with respect to Sections
3.3(a), 3.7(a), 3.7(b) and Section 3.8(a), except as disclosed in the Filed
SEC Reports (as defined below) filed prior to the date of this Agreement
(excluding any disclosures set forth in any section of a Filed SEC Report
entitled "Risk Factor" or "Forward-Looking Statements" or any other
disclosures included in such filings to the extent that they are cautionary,
predictive or forward-looking in nature):

 

 

SECTION 3.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. Each of the
Company and its subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of
good standing) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has
all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except, in the case of any subsidiary of the Company, where any
such failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have such
power or authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Each of the Company and its
subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except for any such failure to be so qualified or licensed which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
"Material Adverse Effect" means any change, effect, event or circumstance
that is, or would reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, materially adverse to the business, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken
as a whole, other than any change, effect or circumstance to the extent
resulting from (i) changes in general economic, financial market or
geopolitical conditions, (ii) general changes or developments in the industry
in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate, (iii) the announcement of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including any
termination of, reduction in or similar negative impact on relationships,
contractual or otherwise, with any customers, suppliers, distributors,
partners or employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to the extent due
to the announcement and performance of this Agreement or the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-8-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identity of Parent or Holdings, or the performance of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including compliance with the covenants set
forth herein (in each case, other than in respect of Section 3.5), (iv) any
actions required under this Agreement to obtain any approval or authorization
required under applicable antitrust or competition laws for the consummation
of the Merger, (v) changes in any applicable laws or regulations or
applicable accounting regulations or principles or interpretations thereof,
(vi) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or war or any act of terrorism
or (vii) any failure by the Company to meet any published analyst estimates
or expectations of the Company\'s revenue, earnings or other financial
performance or results of operations for any period, in and of itself, or any
failure by the Company to meet its internal or published projections,
budgets, plans or forecasts of its revenues, earnings or other financial
performance or results of operations, in and of itself (it being understood
that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such failure
that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of a "Material Adverse
Effect" may be taken into account in determining whether there has been a
Material Adverse Effect); provided that, in the case of the
immediately preceding clauses (i), (ii), (v) and (vi), such changes, effects
or circumstances do not affect the Company or its subsidiaries
disproportionately relative to other companies operating in the same
industry.

 

 

SECTION 3.2 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Company has
heretofore furnished or otherwise made available to Holdings a complete and
correct copy of the restated certificate of incorporation, as amended to date
(the "Certificate of Incorporation"), and the bylaws (the "Bylaws") of
the Company as currently in effect. The Certificate of Incorporation and the
Bylaws are in full force and effect and no other organizational documents are

any provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws.

the Company Requisite Votes, the Board of Directors of the Company may effect
a Change of Recommendation if (i) the Board of Directors shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,

that such action is necessary in order for the Board of Directors to act in a
manner consistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (ii)

Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, without providing

records, and shall furnish Holdings with all financial, operating and other
data and information as Holdings, through its officers, employees or
Representatives, may from time to time reasonably request in writing.

business or operations of the Company or its subsidiaries or otherwise result
in any significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such
employees of their normal duties. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-

representing 20% or more of the consolidated assets or net income of the
Company and its subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as
an "Acquisition Proposal"), or (B) directly or indirectly, engage in any
negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide access to its properties,
books and records or any confidential information or data to, any person
relating to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will, and it
will cause its subsidiaries and Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall (I) promptly (and in no event later than forty-
eight (48) hours after receipt) notify Holdings in writing of the receipt of

after the date of this Agreement, which notice shall include the identity of
the person making such Acquisition Proposal and set forth in reasonable
details the material terms and conditions thereof, (II) keep Holdings
reasonably informed on a current basis

(and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours of the occurrence of any
material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations, unless any such
material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations are received by
the Company in writing, then such time period shall be reduced to twenty-four
(24) hours) of the status and details (including any change to the financial
or other material terms thereof) of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
request and (III) provide Holdings as soon as practicable (and in any event
within 24 hours) after receipt thereof copies of any written Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request (including any amendments, modifications or
supplements thereto). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from: (i)
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a
tender offer or exchange offer) or from making any legally required
disclosure to stockholders with regard to an Acquisition Proposal (provided
that neither the Company nor its Board of Directors may make any Change of
Recommendation unless permitted by Section 6.1); (ii) prior to obtaining the
Company Requisite Votes, providing access to its properties, books and
records and providing information or data (provided that, to the extent not
previously given to Holdings, such access, information or data is also given
to Holdings promptly after providing access thereto to any person in
accordance with this Section 6.5(a), unless providing such access,
information or data to Holdings would reasonably be expected to make it more
difficult in any material respect to obtain all requisite clearances,
approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Law) in response to a request
therefor by a person who has made an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors receives from the
person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement
on terms no more favorable to such person than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes specifically necessary in
order for the Company to be able to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement); (iii) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Votes, contacting
or engaging in any discussions with any person who has made an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal solely for the purpose of clarifying
such Acquisition Proposal and any material terms thereof and the conditions
to consummation so as to determine whether such Acquisition Proposal would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal; and (iv) prior to
obtaining the Company Requisite Votes, contacting or engaging in any
negotiations or discussions with any person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal (which negotiations and discussions are not
solely for clarification purposes), if and only to the extent that in
connection with the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iv), (1) the Company has not
breached its obligations under this Section 6.5(a), (2) the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors
that, (x) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to constitute or result in, a Superior Proposal, and (y) that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable law and (3) prior to taking such action, the Company shall
provide written notice to Holdings of such matter. The Company shall not, and
shall cause its subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality or
similar agreement with any person which prohibits the Company from providing
to Holdings any of the information required to be provided to Holdings under
this Section 6.5 within the time periods contemplated hereby.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-37-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend,
adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Proposal
Documentation (as defined below) or (ii) execute (or allow the Company or any
of its subsidiaries to execute) any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other similar agreement constituting an Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement pursuant to Section 6.5(a)) (any such
documentation, "Acquisition Proposal Documentation"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Section 6.5 to the contrary, if, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Votes (but after the
expiration of the Notice Period (as defined below)), the Company's Board of
Directors determines, in response to an Acquisition Proposal that was
unsolicited and that did not otherwise result from a breach of Section 6.5(a)
in any material respect, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal (after giving effect to all of the adjustments to this Agreement
which may be offered by Holdings prior to or during the Notice Period), (1)
the Company may terminate this Agreement, (2) the Company's Board of
Directors may approve or recommend such Superior Proposal to its stockholders
(it being understood that any such approval or recommendation shall
constitute a Change of Recommendation) and/or (3) immediately prior to
or concurrently with the termination of this Agreement, the Company may enter
into or execute any Acquisition Proposal Documentation with respect to such
Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company may not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.5(b), and any such termination
shall be void and of no force or effect, unless the Company prior to or
concurrently with such termination pays to Holdings the fee payable pursuant
to Section 8.2(b); and provided, further, that the Company may not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.5(b) unless (x) the Company has
provided a written notice to Holdings (a "Notice of Superior Proposal")
advising Holdings that the Company has received a Superior Proposal and
specifying the identity of the person making such Superior Proposal and the
material terms thereof, together with copies of any written offer or proposal
in respect of such Superior Proposal (it being understood that neither the
delivery of a Notice of Superior Proposal nor any subsequent
public announcement thereof, in each case in and of itself, shall entitle
Holdings to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(ii)), and (y)
Holdings does not, within four business days following its receipt of the
Notice of Superior Proposal (the "Notice Period"), make an offer that, as
determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, results in the
applicable Acquisition Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal (provided
that, during the Notice Period, the Company shall, if so requested by
Holdings, negotiate in good faith with Holdings with respect to any revised
proposal from Holdings in respect of the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), it being further understood and agreed that
any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior
Proposal shall require the delivery to Holdings of a new Notice of Superior
Proposal and a new Notice Period.

 

 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any
Acquisition Proposal for more than 80% of the outstanding equity interests in
the Company or more than 80% of the consolidated assets of the Company and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on terms that the Board of Directors of
the Company determined in good faith, after consultation with the Company\'s
outside legal and financial advisors (taking into account such factors as the
Board of Directors of the Company considers to be appropriate including the
conditionality,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-38-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

timing and likelihood of consummation of such Acquisition Proposal) are more
favorable to the Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(d) Without limiting any other rights of Holdings under this Agreement,
neither any Change of Recommendation nor any termination of this Agreement
shall have any effect on any of the approvals or other actions referred to
herein for the purpose of causing the Anti-Takeover Statutes to be
inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

SECTION 6.6 Employment and Employee Benefits Matters.

 

 

(a) The Surviving Corporation and each of its subsidiaries, for the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the second anniversary
thereof, shall (i) maintain, for any employee of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries (including but not limited to inactive employees on short-term
disability or paid or unpaid leave of absence status, including medical
family leave) who remains employed by the Surviving Corporation or one of its
subsidiaries, for so long as such employee remains so employed following the
Effective Time (each a "Continuing Employee"), annual base salary or wages
and annual cash target bonus opportunities that are, in the aggregate, no
less favorable than those in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(ii) maintain employee benefits (excluding equity-based programs) for
Continuing Employees providing welfare and retirement benefits that are, in
the aggregate, no less favorable than those provided to such Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) establish a long-
term cash incentive bonus program for the benefit of Continuing Employees who
received equity-based awards under any of the Company Stock Plans, which
shall provide such employees with a bonus opportunity that is designed to be
no less favorable than the bonus opportunity provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent or any of its subsidiaries; provided, however, subject
to the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or termination
of any Company Plan or interfere with the Surviving Corporation's or any
Company subsidiary's right or obligation to make such changes as are
necessary to conform with applicable law.

 

 

(b) As of and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will give
Continuing Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility to participate
and vesting and benefit accruals, under any employee benefit plans maintained
for the benefit of Continuing Employees as of and after the Effective Time by
the Surviving Corporation (each, a "Surviving Corporation Plan") for the
Continuing Employees' service with the Company, its subsidiaries and their
predecessor entities to the same extent recognized by the Company in
connection with the Company Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time
(except to the extent this credit would result in a duplication of
benefit accruals for the same period of service under any defined benefit
pension plans). With respect to each Surviving Corporation Plan that is
a "welfare benefit plan" under Section 3(1) of ERISA which are made available
to Continuing Employees in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs,
the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to
be waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations and (ii)
give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations, to claims incurred

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-39-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Company Employees under
similar plans maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are solely for the benefit of the
respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Section 6.6, express
or implied, shall confer upon any Company Employee, or legal representative
or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation
or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in
this Section 6.6, expressed or implied, shall be construed to prevent the
Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates from terminating or modifying
to any extent or in any respect any benefit plan that the Surviving
Corporation or any of its affiliates may establish or maintain.

 

 

SECTION 6.7 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

 

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under
any employment agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time through the
sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Holdings
and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and
hold harmless each present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer or
director of the Company and its subsidiaries in their capacity as such (the
"Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys\' fees and disbursements (collectively, "Costs"),
incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and
the transactions and actions contemplated hereby)), arising out of or
pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer,
director, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law. In the event of any such
Action, (x) each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any Action from Holdings or the Surviving
Corporation within ten business days of receipt by Holdings from the
Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided that any person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent
required by the DGCL or the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation
or Bylaws, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to indemnification, (y) neither Holdings nor the
Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any proceeding or threatened Action (and in which indemnification
could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such Action or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents, and (z) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the
defense of any such matter.

 

 

(b) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present
directors and officers than are presently set forth in the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any such individuals.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-40-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain, at no expense to the
beneficiaries, for a period of not less than six years after the Effective
Time for the persons who, as of the date of this Agreement, are covered by
the Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies,
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies that provide coverage
for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO
Insurance") that are no less favorable in both amount and terms and
conditions of coverage than the existing policies of the Company (true and
complete copies of which have previously been made available to Holdings) or,
if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage, in either case from insurance carriers with financial
strength ratings equal to or greater than the financial strength ratings of
the Company\'s existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
carriers; provided, however, that, in lieu of the foregoing, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation may, or if requested by Holdings, the Company
shall, purchase a six-year "tail" coverage (provided that only the cost of
the Side A coverage for Indemnified Parties where the existing policies also
include coverage for the Company shall be taken into account for purposes of
calculating the 300% threshold below) that is no less favorable in both
amount and terms and conditions of coverage than the existing policies of the
Company from insurance carriers with financial strength ratings equal to or
greater than the financial strength ratings of the Company\'s existing
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance carriers; provided further that
in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to, and the Company
shall not be permitted to, pay aggregate premiums for insurance under this
Section 6.7(c) in excess of 300% of the amount of the aggregate premiums paid
by the Company in respect of such coverage for its most recently completed
fiscal year; provided, further, that if the aggregate premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain policies with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such amount.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is brought against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this Section 6.7 shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such Action.

 

 

(e) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs
and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not
be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

 

 

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Holdings or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its assets and properties to any person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation or Holdings, as the case may be, shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7. In addition, the Surviving
Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any
of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the
Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this
Section 6.7.

 

 

SECTION 6.8 Further Action; Efforts.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-41-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable laws and regulations to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to cause the conditions to
Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
and all Foreign Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event prior to the expiration of
any applicable legal deadline (provided that the filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act will be made within 20 business days of
the date of this Agreement) and to supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and to use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and the receipt of the requisite
clearances, approvals and authorizations under any other Antitrust Law.

 

 

(b) Each of Holdings and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section
6.8(a) to obtain all requisite clearances, approvals and authorizations for
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any
other Antitrust Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party; (ii) keep the other party reasonably informed
of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to,
the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the "DOJ") or any other U.S. or foreign Governmental
Entity and of any communication received or given in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (iii) permit the other party to review any
communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity
or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other
person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other
applicable Governmental Entity or other person, give the other party
the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Antitrust Law" means the Sherman Act, as
amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, as amended, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other federal, state and foreign,
if any, Laws and Orders that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict
or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

 

 

(c) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or
private party challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, the Company shall
cooperate in all respects with Holdings and Merger Sub and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-42-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the contrary, none of Holdings, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates
shall be required to defend, contest or resist any action or proceeding,
whether judicial or administrative, or to take any action to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of
Holdings, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates shall be required to, and the
Company may not, without the prior written consent of Holdings, become
subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action
with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding,
agreement or order to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of business
of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Holdings, Merger Sub or any of
their respective affiliates, (ii) conduct, restrict, operate, invest or
otherwise change the assets, business or portion of business of the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, Holdings, Merger Sub or any of their respective
affiliates in any manner, or (iii) impose any restriction, requirement or
limitation on the operation of the business or portion of the business of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Holdings, Merger Sub or any of their
respective affiliates; provided that, if requested by Holdings, the Company
will become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take
any action with respect to, any such requirement, condition, limitation,
understanding, agreement or order so long as such requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order is only binding on the Company
in the event the Closing occurs.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 6.8 shall limit a party's right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) so long as such party has, prior to such
termination, complied in all material respects with its obligations under
this Section 6.8.

 

 

SECTION 6.9 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a release
mutually agreed to by the Company and Holdings. Thereafter, each of the
Company, Holdings and Merger Sub agrees that no public release or
announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued
by any party without the prior written consent of the Company and Holdings
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such
release or announcement may be required by law or the rules or regulations of
any applicable United States securities exchange or regulatory or
governmental body to which the relevant party is subject, wherever situated,
in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall
use its reasonable best efforts to provide the other party reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

 

 

SECTION 6.10 Financing.

 

 

(a) (i) Holdings shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Financing Commitment Letters (or on revised terms
no less favorable in any material respect to Holdings (as determined in the
reasonable judgment of Holdings)) which terms do not contain any provisions
which would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-43-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impede the consummation of the Financing or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain in
effect the Financing Commitment Letters, (B) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Holdings and Merger Sub obtaining the Debt Financing
that are within their control, (C) negotiate definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Financing
Commitment Letters (including any "flex" provisions) and (D) consummate the
Financing at or prior to the Closing; provided that in no circumstance shall
Holdings, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates be required to commence
litigation or bring any other Action against the lenders and other persons
providing Financing to seek to enforce Holdings', Merger Sub's or any
of their affiliates' rights under the Financing Commitment Letters
or otherwise. Holdings shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub to, agree
to or permit any amendment, replacements, supplement or other
modification of, or waive any of its material rights under, any Financing
Commitment Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing
Commitment Letters (including any and all fee letters), in each case, without
the Company\'s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except any such amendment, replacement, supplement or
other modification to or waiver of any provision of the Financing Commitment
Letters or any definitive agreements relating thereto, including any and all
fee letters, that amends the Financing in a manner that would not reasonably
be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the Financing or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Holdings and Merger
Sub may replace and amend the Debt Financing Commitment Letters to add
lenders, lead arrangers, book runners, syndication agents or similar entities
who had not executed Debt Financing Commitment Letters as of the date of this
Agreement so long as any such addition would not reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially hinder or materially delay the consummation of the Debt
Financing or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Upon any such
amendment, replacement, supplement or modification of any of the Financing
Commitment Letters in accordance with this Section 6.10(a), the term
"Financing Commitment Letters" shall mean the Financing Commitment Letters as
so amended, replaced, supplemented or modified in accordance with this
Section 6.10(a) and, in the event that Holdings or Merger Sub obtains
Alternative Financing in accordance with this Section 6.10(a), the term
"Financing Commitment Letters" shall mean the commitment letter or letters
(as amended, replaced, supplemented or modified in accordance with this
Section 6.10(a)) related to the Alternative Financing.

 

 

(ii) In the event all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the
Debt Financing Commitment Letters for any reason, Holdings shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event but no later than the final day of the
Marketing Period, alternative financing from alternative sources (the
"Alternative Financing") in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement which would not involve terms
that are less favorable in any material respect to Holdings (as determined in
the reasonable judgment of Holdings) and which would not contain any
provisions which would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the consummation of the Financing or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that Alternative Financing shall
be obtained pursuant to this Section 6.10(a)(ii), Holdings shall comply with
its covenants in Section 6.10(a)(i) with respect to such Alternative
Financing. For purposes of this Agreement, "Marketing Period" shall mean the
first period of 30

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-44-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consecutive days throughout and at the end of which (A) Holdings shall have
(and its financing sources shall have access to) the Required Information
that the Company is required to provide to Holdings pursuant to Section
6.10(b), (B) the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 shall be satisfied or,
solely in the event that the Marketing Period has not commenced prior to
March 30, 2009, then only the condition set forth in Section 7.1(a) need be
satisfied throughout such 30 consecutive days (it being understood that all
of the conditions set forth in Section 7.l shall nevertheless be required to
be satisfied at the end of such 30 consecutive day period) and (C) nothing
has occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of the conditions
set forth in Section 7.2(a), 7.2(b) or 7.2(c) to fail to be satisfied
assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for any time during such 30
consecutive day period; provided that (i) if the Marketing Period has not
ended on or prior to August 14, 2008, the Marketing Period shall commence no
earlier than September 2, 2008, (ii) if the Marketing Period has not ended on
or prior to December 16, 2008, the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier
than January 3, 2009 and (iii) the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to
have commenced if Ernst and Young LLP shall have withdrawn its audit opinion
with respect to any financial statements contained in the Filed SEC Reports
unless and until a new unqualified audit opinion is issued with respect to
the consolidated financial statements for the applicable periods by Ernst and
Young LLP or another independent registered accounting firm reasonably
acceptable to Holdings.

 

 

(iii) Holdings shall give the Company prompt written notice of any material
breach by any party of any of the Financing Commitment Letters (or
commitments for any Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with this
Section 6.10(a)) of which Holdings becomes aware or any termination of any of
the Financing Commitment Letters (or commitments for any Alternative
Financing obtained in accordance with this Section 6.10(a)). Holdings shall
keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail
of the status of its efforts to arrange and consummate the Financing (or
Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with this Section 6.10(a)).

 

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide to Holdings and Merger
Sub, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the respective officers, employees and Representatives of
the Company and its subsidiaries to, provide to Holdings and Merger Sub all
cooperation reasonably requested by Holdings that is necessary or reasonably
required in connection with the Financing, including the following: (i) using
reasonable best efforts to cause the Company's senior officers and other
Representatives to participate in meetings, presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions), drafting
sessions and sessions with rating agencies; (ii) assisting with the
preparation of appropriate and customary materials for rating agency
presentations, offering documents, bank information memoranda (including the
delivery of customary representation letters as contemplated by the Senior
Debt Commitment Letter) and similar documents reasonably required in
connection with the Financing; (iii) using its reasonable best efforts to
assist with the preparation of any pledge and security documents, any loan
agreement, currency or interest hedging agreement, other definitive financing
documents on terms satisfactory to Holdings, or other certificates, legal
opinions or documents as may be reasonably requested by Holdings (including a
certificate from the person who will be the Chief Financial Officer of the
Surviving Corporation that the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries, on
a consolidated basis, will be solvent as of the Closing (after giving effect
to the Debt Financing and the other

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-45-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transactions contemplated by this Agreement)), provided that no obligation of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries under any such document or agreement
shall be effective until the Effective Time; (iv) using reasonable best
efforts to facilitate the pledging of collateral, provided that no pledge
shall be effective until the Effective Time; (v) using reasonable best
efforts to furnish on a confidential basis to Holdings and Merger Sub and
their financing sources, as promptly as practicable, with financial and other
pertinent information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by
Holdings, including all financial statements and other financial data
required by the Debt Financing Commitment Letters (the
"Required Information"); (vi) providing monthly financial statements
(excluding footnotes) to the extent the Company customarily prepares such
financial statements within the time such statements are customarily
prepared; and (vii) using reasonable best efforts to cause its independent
accountants to cooperate with and assist Holdings in preparing customary and
appropriate information packages and offering materials as the parties to the
Debt Financing Commitment Letters may reasonably request for use in
connection with the offering and/or syndication of debt securities,
loan participations and other matters contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall require
such cooperation to the extent it would, in the Company's reasonable
judgment, interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries; provided further that notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, until the Effective Time occurs,
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall (1) be required to pay
any commitment or other similar fee, (2) have any liability or obligation
under any loan agreement or any related document or any other agreement or
document related to the Financing (or Alternative Financing) or (3) be
required to incur any other liability in connection with the
Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters (or any
Alternative Financing). Parent shall, promptly upon written request by
the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs to the extent such costs are incurred by the Company or its
subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation provided by the Company, its
subsidiaries, their respective officers, employees and other Representatives
pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.10(b) or in connection with
compliance with its obligations under this Section 6.10(b) and Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its subsidiaries and their
respective officers, employees and Representatives from and against any and
all liabilities or losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith (other than arising from information provided by the Company or its
subsidiaries), except in the event such liabilities or losses arose out of or
result from the willful misconduct of the Company, any of its subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives. The Company hereby consents to the
use of its and its subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Debt Financing;
provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its subsidiaries
or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and
its or their marks.

 

 

SECTION 6.11 Debt Tender Offers.

 

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of any written
request by Holdings to do so, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to commence offers to purchase any or all of the outstanding
aggregate amount and all other amounts due of either or both series of the
Notes, on such terms and conditions, including pricing terms, that are

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-46-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specified, from time to time, by Holdings (each a "Debt Tender Offer" and
collectively, the "Debt Tender Offers") and Holdings shall assist the Company
in connection therewith; provided that the Company's counsel shall provide
normal and customary legal opinions (excluding with respect to federal
securities laws) required in connection with the Debt Tender Offers.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the closing of the Debt Tender Offers shall be
conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and the parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Tender Offers to close on the
Closing Date. Subject to the preceding sentence, the Company shall provide,
and shall cause its subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation
reasonably requested by Holdings in connection with the Debt Tender Offers.
The Company (i) shall waive any of the conditions to the Debt Tender Offers
(other than the occurrence of the Closing) and make any change to the Debt
Tender Offers, in each case, as may be reasonably requested by Holdings and
(ii) shall not, without the written consent of Holdings, waive any condition
to the Debt Tender Offers or make any changes to the Debt Tender Offers.
Holdings shall ensure that at the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation
has all funds necessary to pay for the Notes that have been properly tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Tender Offers.

 

 

(b) The dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent, depositary or
other agent retained in connection with the Debt Tender Offers shall be
selected by Holdings. The Company shall enter into customary
agreements (including indemnities) with such parties so selected and on terms
and conditions acceptable to Holdings.

 

 

(c) With respect to any series of Notes, if requested by Holdings in writing
on a timely basis, in lieu of commencing a Debt Tender Offer for such series
(or in addition thereto), the Company shall, to the extent permitted by the
Indenture governing such series of Notes, (A) issue a notice of redemption
providing for the redemption on a date agreed with Holdings not more than 30
days after the delivery of such notice of redemption (or such later time
required by the Indenture) for all of the outstanding aggregate principal
amount of Notes of such series pursuant to the requisite provisions of the
Indenture, and/or (B) take any actions reasonably requested by Holdings that
are reasonably necessary to facilitate the defeasance, satisfaction and/or
discharge of such series pursuant to the applicable section of the Indenture,
and shall redeem, defease or satisfy and/or discharge, as applicable, such
series in accordance with the terms of the Indenture at the Effective Time;
provided, that the Company's counsel shall provide such legal opinions as may
be reasonably requested in connection with any such redemption or

of facts or circumstances caused by or arising out of a breach of  Holdings'

set forth in this Agreement) that would reasonably be expected  to cause the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 not to be  satisfied on
or prior to the Termination Date);

to  satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b), Section 7.1(c) or 
Section 7.2(d) (subject to the right of Holdings to waive the condition  set
forth in Section 7.2(d)) due to the failure to receive any required  consent
or clearance under applicable Antitrust Laws from a Governmental  Entity of
competent jurisdiction or any action by any Governmental Entity  of competent
jurisdiction to prevent the Merger for antitrust reasons or  (y) Section
8.1(b) due to the denial of any approval required under  applicable Antitrust
Laws or the taking of any other action by any  antitrust or competition
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction if,  in each of clauses (x) and
(y), at the time of such termination all other  conditions to Closing set
forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 (other than those  conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing but  which conditions would be
satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of  such termination) have

following such termination) by wire transfer of same day funds. In no
event shall the Company be entitled to the Reverse Termination Fee on more
than one occasion.

 

 

(ii) The Company's right to receive payment of the Reverse Termination Fee
from Parent shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its
affiliates against Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub or any of their respective
former, current or future directors, officers, employees, agents,
stockholders, representatives, affiliates or assignees or any former, current
or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner,

breach or failure to perform under this Agreement or otherwise and upon
payment of such amount, none of Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Related Persons shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (except that Holdings shall also be obligated with respect
to Section 6.4(b) and Parent shall also be obligated with respect to the

reimburse amounts due from Parent pursuant to the second sentence of Section
8.2(d) (such payment and indemnification obligations, collectively, the
"Parent Obligations"), (ii) in no event shall the Company or any of its
affiliates seek to recover any money damages or any other recovery, judgment
or damages of any kind, including rescissory, consequential, indirect, or
punitive damages, in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby against Parent (other than for satisfaction of the Parent
Obligations) or against, individually or in the aggregate, Parent, Holdings
or Merger Sub in excess of the Liability Limitation and (iii) in no event
shall the Company or any of its affiliates seek to recover any money damages
or any other recovery, judgment or damages of any kind, including rescissory,
consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby against any of Parent's,

against, and no personal liability shall attach to, any of Parent, Holdings,
Merger Sub or their respective Related Persons, through Holdings, Merger Sub
or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate,
limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or through a claim
by or on behalf of Holdings or Merger Sub against Parent or any of their or
Parent's respective Related Persons, by the enforcement of any assessment or
by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any Law or otherwise,
except for its right to recover from Holdings or Merger Sub (but not any of
Holding's or Merger Sub's respective Related Persons) to the extent provided
in this Agreement, and its right to receive payment and/or indemnification
from Parent pursuant to the Parent Obligations (as limited by the provisions
herein), and subject to the Liability Limitation and the other limitations
described herein. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied
in this Agreement or any document or instrument delivered in connection
herewith, the Company hereby agrees and acknowledges that the Company's right
to receive payment and/or indemnification from Parent pursuant to the Parent
Obligations (as limited by the provisions herein) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company and all of its affiliates against Parent and
its Related Persons (other than Holdings and Merger Sub to the extent, and
subject to the limitations, contained in this Agreement) in respect of any
liabilities or obligations arising under, or in connection with, this
Agreement, the Financing Commitment Letters or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

 

 

(d) Each of the Company, Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the Company
shall fail to pay the Company Termination Fee when due or Parent shall fail
to pay the Reverse Termination Fee when due, the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, shall reimburse the other party for all reasonable costs and
expenses actually incurred or accrued by such other party (including

Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment may be made which
by Law requires the further approval of the stockholders of the Company

termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms under
circumstances in which Parent would have any payment or indemnification
obligations pursuant to the Parent Obligations, except as to a claim for
payment or indemnification presented by the Company to Parent on or prior to
such 90th day; provided, that such claim shall set forth in reasonable
detail the basis for such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that the Company or any of its affiliates asserts in any litigation or other
proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
that the provisions contained in this Agreement limiting Parent's obligations
to the Parent Obligations or limiting Parent's maximum aggregate liability to
the Liability Limitation or that any other provisions in this Agreement
limiting the obligations and liability of Parent and its Related Persons are
illegal, invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, or asserts any theory
of liability against Parent or any of its Related Persons with respect to
this Agreement, the Equity Financing Commitment Letters or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement other than Parent's payment or indemnification
obligations pursuant to the Parent Obligations under this Agreement (as
limited by the provisions hereof) then (A) all obligations of Parent under
this Agreement shall terminate ab initio and shall thereupon be null and
void, (B) if Parent has previously made any payments or
provided indemnification under this Agreement, it shall be entitled to
recover such payments from the Company, and (C) neither Parent nor any of its
Related Persons shall have any liability to the Company or any of its
Affiliates with respect to this Agreement, the Equity Financing Commitment
Letters or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that
it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that it will not
