                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
                          ----------------------------

            AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of November
10, 2002 by and between LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS, a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), DAVINCI DEVELOPMENT, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Merger Sub") and DIANON SYSTEMS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").


                                    RECITALS
                                    --------

            WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company have determined that the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company (the "Merger") in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as amended (the "DGCL"), and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, is advisable and in the best interests of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company and their respective stockholders.

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein and other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto intending to be legally bound do hereby agree
as follows:


                                    ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

      SECTION 1.1.  GENERAL.
                    -------

            (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time (i) Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company, (ii) the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease and (iii) the Company shall be the surviving company (the "Surviving
Company") and shall continue its legal existence under the laws of the State of
Delaware.

            (b) The Merger shall become effective at the time of filing of a
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the provisions of Section 251 of the DGCL, or at such later time
as may be stated in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").

            (c) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at
the offices of Hogan & Hartson, L.L.P., 111 S. Calvert Street, Baltimore,
Maryland 21202 at 10:00 A.M., subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI, two Business Days after the date on which
the last of the conditions set forth in SECTIONS 6.1(a) and 6.1(b) shall have
been satisfied or waived, or on such other date, time and place as the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub may mutually agree (the "Closing Date").

            (d) At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as
provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, and duties of
Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.

      SECTION 1.2.  CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION.
                    ----------------------------

            The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended so that Article FOURTH
of the Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended to read in its entirety as
follows: "The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the
Corporation shall have authority to issue is 100 shares of Common Stock par
value $.01 per share." As so amended, the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Company,
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein and by applicable law.

      SECTION 1.3.  THE BY-LAWS.
                    -----------

            The By-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be adopted as the By-laws of the Surviving Company, until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein and by applicable law.

      SECTION 1.4.  BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.
                    -------------------------------

            From and after the Effective Time, the Board of Directors and
Officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall continue as the Board of
Directors and Officers of the Surviving Company, each to hold office in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Company until his or her respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified.

      SECTION 1.5.  CONVERSION OF SECURITIES.
                    ------------------------

            At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the Company or the holders of the Company's common stock,
par value $0.01 per share (the "Company Common Stock"):

            (a) Each issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub capital stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock of the Surviving
Company;

            (b) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the
Company and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub or Parent
shall be cancelled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution
shall be made with respect thereto; and

            (c) At the Effective Time, each then issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock together with associated Company Rights (as defined in
SECTION 2.3) (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with SECTION
1.5(b)) shall be converted into, and become exchangeable for the right to
receive consideration consisting of $47.50 in cash (the "Merger Consideration").

      SECTION 1.6.  ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVENT DILUTION.
                    -------------------------------

            In the event that, prior to the Effective Date, any stock split,
combination, reclassification or stock dividend with respect to the Company
Common Stock, any change or conversion of Company Common Stock into other
securities or any other dividend or distribution with respect to the Company
Common Stock should occur or, if a record date with respect to any of the
foregoing should occur, appropriate and proportionate adjustments shall be made
to the Merger Consideration, and thereafter all references to the Merger
Consideration shall be deemed to be to such Merger Consideration as so adjusted.

      SECTION 1.7.  EXCHANGE PROCEDURES; DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO
                    UNEXCHANGED SHARES; STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS.
                    --------------------------------------------------

            (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange
agent for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration
(the "Exchange Agent"). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash is referred to herein
as the "Exchange Fund").

            (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to send to each Person who was, at the Effective Time,
a holder of record of certificates which represented outstanding Company Common
Stock (the "Certificates") which shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to SECTION 1.5, a letter of transmittal which
(i) shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to
such Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery thereof to the Exchange
Agent and (ii) shall contain instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of Certificates for
cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, such
holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration, and the Certificates so surrendered shall then be cancelled.
Subject to SECTION 1.7(c) and SECTION 1.8, until surrendered as contemplated by
this SECTION 1.7(b), each Certificate, from and after the Effective Time, shall
be deemed to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the
Merger Consideration.

            (c) If the Merger Consideration is to be paid to any Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor,
it shall be a condition to such exchange that such surrendered Certificate shall
be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and such Person
either (i) shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required
as a result of the distribution of such cash payment to such Person or (ii)
shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
tax has been paid or is not applicable. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such
amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent
or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent or the Exchange Agent. All amounts in respect of taxes received or
withheld by Parent shall be disposed of by Parent in accordance with the Code or
such state, local or foreign tax law, as applicable.

            (d) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and subject to such other reasonable
conditions as the Board of Directors of Parent may impose, Parent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
as determined under SECTION 1.5(c) in respect of such Certificate.

            (e) At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common
Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except
as otherwise provided herein or by applicable law.

      SECTION 1.8.  RETURN OF EXCHANGE FUND.
                    -----------------------

            Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the
holders of Company Common Stock for six months after the Effective Date shall be
delivered to Parent, upon its request, and any such former holders who have not
theretofore surrendered to the Exchange Agent their Certificates in compliance
herewith shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration

      SECTION 1.9.  NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK.
                    ---------------------------------------------------

            The Merger Consideration delivered upon the surrender for exchange
of any Certificate in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been delivered (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate.

      SECTION 1.10.  FURTHER ASSURANCES.
                     ------------------

            If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving Company shall
consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances
or any other acts or things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest,
perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Company, its right,
title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers,
franchises, properties or Assets of either the Company or Merger Sub or (b)
otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Company and
its proper officers and directors or their designees shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, all
such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and do, in the name and on
behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, all such other acts and things necessary,
desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm its right, title or interest in,
to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or
Assets of the Company or Merger Sub and otherwise to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement.

      SECTION 1.11.  APPRAISAL RIGHTS
                     ----------------


            (a) Each outstanding share of Company Common Stock as to which a
written demand for appraisal is filed in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
at or prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting (as hereinafter defined) and not
withdrawn at or prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting and which is not voted
in favor of the Merger shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the Merger Consideration hereunder unless and until the holder shall
have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her
right to appraisal of and payment for his or her Company Common Stock under such
Section 262, at which time his or her Company Common Stock shall be treated in
accordance with SECTION 1.11(b) below. All such Company Common Stock as to which
such a written demand for appraisal is so filed and not withdrawn at or prior to
the time of such vote and which are not voted in favor of the Merger, except any
such Company Common Stock the holder of which, prior to the Effective Time,
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, his or her right to appraisal of and
payment for his or her Company Common Stock under such Section 262, are herein
called "Dissenting Shares." The Company shall give Parent prompt notice upon
receipt by the Company of any written demands for appraisal rights, withdrawal
of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL, and the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal rights
and shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Parent, settle or
offer to settle any such demands. Each holder of Company Common Stock who
becomes entitled, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, to payment for his or her
Company Common Stock under the provisions of such section shall receive payment
therefor from the Surviving Corporation and such Company Common Stock shall be
cancelled.

            (b) If prior to the Effective Time any stockholder of the Company
shall fail to perfect, or shall effectively withdraw or lose, his or her right
to appraisal of and payment for his or her Dissenting Shares under Section 262
of the DGCL, the Company Common Stock of such holder shall be treated for
purposes of this ARTICLE I like any other shares of Company Common Stock. If,
after the Effective Time, any holder of Company Common Stock shall fail to
perfect, or shall effectively withdraw or lose, his or her right to appraisal of
and payment for his or her Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL, each
Dissenting Share of such holder shall be treated as though such share has been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this
ARTICLE I.


                                   ARTICLE II

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

            The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub
as follows:

      SECTION 2.1.  ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION.
                    ------------------------------

            The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of Delaware and each of its Subsidiaries is a
corporation or other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization. Each of
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate (or
similar) power and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted and
to perform the terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to conduct
its business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the
ownership or leasing of its Assets or the nature of its activities in connection

its Subsidiaries currently maintains all Environmental Permits with respect to
the business of the Company, all of which are valid and in full force and

respect to any pending Environmental Permits, the Company and the Subsidiaries
have timely filed applications for all such Environmental Permits, except where
the failure to do so would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the

      SECTION 2.15.  EMPLOYMENT AND BENEFIT MATTERS.

2.15(A) lists each employee benefit plan, program, arrangement and contract
(including, without limitation, any "employee benefit plan" as defined by
Section 3(3) of ERISA), and any benefit program or policy providing for bonuses,
incentive compensation, vacation pay, severance pay, insurance, restricted
stock, stock options, employee discounts, company cars, tuition reimbursement or
any other perquisite or benefit (including, without limitation, any fringe
benefit under Section 132 of the Code), applicable to current or former
employees or individual consultants of the Company and each Subsidiary to which
the Company or any Subsidiary has contributed or under which the Company or any
Subsidiary has any liability (collectively, the "Company Benefit Plans"). The
Company has delivered or made available to Parent, to the extent they exist, a
true and correct copy of (i) the three most recent annual reports (Form 5500
series) filed with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with respect to each
Company Benefit Plan or similar report of the jurisdiction in which such
employee benefit plan is located, (ii) each such Company Benefit Plan document,
(iii) each trust agreement or other funding vehicle relating to each such
Company Benefit Plan, (iv) the most recent summary plan description for each
Company Benefit Plan for which a summary plan description is required, and (v)
the most recent determination letter issued by the IRS with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code or similar
report of the jurisdiction in which such employee benefit plan is located. No
Company Benefit Plan is or has ever been a "defined benefit plan" (as such term
is defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA), a Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary
Association (within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code) or an employee
stock ownership plan (within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code). No
Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" as such term is defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA. No Company Benefit Plan provides for post-retirement
medical or life insurance to current, former or retired employees of the Company
(other than legally required health care continuation coverage). All Company
Benefit Plans subject to the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the United
States of America or one of its political subdivisions comply with, and have
been administered in compliance with the Laws of such foreign jurisdiction.

            (b) COMPLIANCE. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 2.15(B), the Company
and each Subsidiary has complied, in all material respects, with all applicable
provisions of the Company Benefit Plans and the Code, ERISA, the Securities Act,

Company's Knowledge, all Company Benefit Plans that are subject to Section
4980B(f) of the Code and Sections 601 through 609 of ERISA comply with and have
been administered in compliance with the health care continuation coverage
requirements for tax-favored status under Section 4980B(f) of the Code, Sections
601 through 609 of ERISA and all final Treasury Regulations under Section 4890B
of the Code explaining those requirements and all other applicable Laws
regarding continuation and/or conversion coverage. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has any liability for any delinquent contributions within the meaning
of Section 515 of ERISA (including, without limitation, related attorneys' fees,
costs, liquidated damages and interest) or for any arrearages of wages. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has any pending unfair labor practice charges,
contract grievances under any collective bargaining agreement, other
administrative charges, claims, grievances or lawsuits before any court,
governmental agency, regulatory body, or arbiter arising under any Law governing
any Company Benefit Plan or any other Law relating to the Company's or its
Subsidiaries' relationships with their employees, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, no such action has been threatened and there exist no facts that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to such a claim. All Company Benefit Plans
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code are so qualified.
Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 2.15(B), no Company Benefit Plan, individually
or collectively, provides for any payment by the Company or any Subsidiary to
any employee or other service provider that is not deductible under Section
162(a)(1) or 404 of the Code or that is an "excess parachute payment" pursuant
to Section 280G of the Code.

            (c) COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. There are no collective
bargaining agreements applicable to the Company's or any of its Subsidiary's
employees and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any duty to
bargain with any labor organization with respect to any such persons. There is
not pending any demand for recognition or any other request or demand from a
labor organization for representative status with respect to any persons
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

            (d) EMPLOYEE INFORMATION. Except as would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, with respect to any persons employed by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, the Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with
all Laws respecting employment conditions and practices and have withheld all
amounts required by any applicable Laws to be withheld from wages.

             (e) EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES. Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 2.15(E),
to the Knowledge of the Company, with respect to any persons employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (i) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has engaged in any unfair labor practice within the meaning of the National
Labor Relations Act or violated any legal requirement prohibiting discrimination
on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, religion, age, marital
status, handicap, or any other classification or status protected by Law, in its
employment conditions or practices; and (ii) there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened unfair labor practice charges or
discrimination complaints relating to race, color, national origin, sex,
religion, age, marital status, or handicap against the Company or any Subsidiary
before any Governmental Entity nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, does any
basis therefor exist.

            (f) CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS. Except as would not
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, all contributions to, and payments from,
each Company Benefit Plan which may have been required to be made in accordance
with the terms of such plan, and, where applicable, the laws of the jurisdiction
which govern such plan, have been made in a timely manner, and all material
reports, returns and similar documents (including applications for approval of
contributions) with respect to any Company Benefit Plan required to be filed
with any Governmental Entity or distributed to any participant of such plan have
been duly filed on a timely basis or distributed.

            (g) IMMIGRATION LAWS. To the Company's Knowledge, the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries has complied, in all material respects, with all Laws
governing the employment of personnel by U.S. companies and the employment of
non-U.S. nationals in the United States, including, but not limited to, the

implementing regulations.

      SECTION 5.3.  ACCESS; DOCUMENTS; SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION.
                    -------------------------------------------

            (a) From and after the date hereof until the Closing, and subject to
the limitations of applicable Laws, each of Parent and the Company shall afford,
and, with respect to clause (ii) below, shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its independent certified public accountants to afford, (i) to the
officers, independent certified public accountants, counsel and other
representatives of the other party, upon reasonable notice, access during normal
business hours to the properties, books and records, including its and its
Subsidiaries' Tax returns filed and in preparation and the right to consult with
its and its Subsidiaries' officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives in order that the other party may have full opportunity to make
reasonable investigations of its and its Subsidiaries' operations, properties,
business, financial condition and prospects, (ii) to its independent certified
public accountants, reasonable access during normal business hours to the work
papers and other records of the independent accountants, and (iii) to the other
party, such additional financial and operating data and other information as to
its and its Subsidiaries' properties, operations, business, financial condition
and prospects as the other party shall from time to time reasonably require;
provided, however, that either party may restrict the foregoing access to the
extent that (A) in the reasonable judgment of such party, any law, treaty, rule
or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to such party requires such
party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties
or information, (B) in the reasonable judgment of such party, the information is
subject to confidentiality obligations to a third party, (C) such disclosure
would result in disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties, or (D)
disclosure of any such information or document could result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege; provided, however, that with respect to this clause
(D), the parties and/or counsel for the parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to enter into such joint defense agreements or other arrangements, as
appropriate, so as to avoid the loss of attorney-client privilege, and provided
further that any information and documents received by the other party or its
representatives (whether furnished before or after the date of this Agreement)
shall be held in confidence in accordance with the confidentiality agreement by
and between Parent and the Company dated August 6, 2002 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), which shall remain in full force and effect pursuant to the terms
thereof as though the Confidentiality Agreement had been entered into by the
parties on the date of this Agreement, notwithstanding the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the termination hereof. Each party shall be
responsible for the breach of the terms of this SECTION 5.3 by its agents or
representatives. Any investigation by Parent or the Company shall not affect the
representations of the Company and Parent, as the case may be. In the event of
any conflict between the terms of this SECTION 5.3 and the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
control.

            (b) From the date of this Agreement through and including the
Closing, each party will furnish to the other party copies of any notices,
documents, requests, court papers, or other materials received from any
governmental agency or any other third party with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless, in the opinion of counsel to a party,
such furnishing of documents would be inappropriate due to privilege or other
legal issues.

      SECTION 5.4.  ACQUISITION PROPOSALS.
                    ---------------------

            (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its directors, officers
or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant
or other representative retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly
or indirectly through another Person, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing information), or take any other action to
facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer other than the
Merger that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) or (ii) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish
to any Person any information with respect to, or accept or implement any
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that prior to the time at which the
Company Requisite Vote shall have been obtained, the Company may, in response to
an Acquisition Proposal received subsequent to the date hereof which did not
result from a breach of this SECTION 5.4 and which the Board of Directors of the
Company determines is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, and
subject to providing prior written notice of its decision to take such action to
Parent and compliance with SECTION 5.4, furnish information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to any Person making such Acquisition Proposal
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement which is (i) no less favorable
to the Company and (ii) no less restrictive on the Person requesting such
information than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

            For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any
written proposal not solicited in breach of this SECTION 5.4 by the Company made
by a third party to consummate a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation or similar transaction which would result in such third party (or
its stockholders) owning, directly or indirectly, a majority of the shares of
Company Common Stock then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger)
or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, and otherwise on terms which a majority of the members of the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and its financial advisor) to be more favorable to the
Company's stockholders, from a financial point of view, than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In reaching such good faith determination, the
Board of Directors of the Company shall give significant consideration to
whether any such third party proposal includes definitive financing and is
reasonably capable of being consummated.

            For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person other than Parent relating to any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of more than 10% of the total assets
(including without limitation stock of Subsidiaries) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any shares of any class or series of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries constituting more than 10%
of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, any tender offer or exchange
offer involving more than 10% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
or any merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

            (b) Neither the Company nor the Board of Directors of the Company
nor any committee thereof shall (i) make a Change in the Company Board
Recommendation (as defined in SECTION 5.6(a) below), (ii) approve or recommend
any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) approve or recommend, or execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement (each, an
"Acquisition Agreement"), in any such case to permit or facilitate the
consummation of an Acquisition Proposal, or agree to do any of the foregoing
constituting or related to, or which is intended to or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time prior to the time at which the Requisite Company Vote shall have been
obtained, in response to a Superior Proposal which did not result from a breach
of SECTION 5.4(a), the Board of Directors of the Company may (subject to this
sentence and the definition of the term "Superior Proposal"), after consultation
with outside counsel and financial advisors, subject to payment of the
termination fee provided for in SECTION 7.2 (if applicable), (i) make a Change
in the Company Board Recommendation or (ii) approve or recommend a Superior
Proposal or cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into a
definitive written agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, but in each
case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), only if the Company
notifies Parent, in writing, at least 48 hours prior to taking any such action,
of its intention to take such action, specifying the material terms of such
Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal, and
Parent does not make, on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second
Business Day following receipt of such written notification, an offer that the
Board of Directors of the Company determines, in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors, is at least as favorable to the stockholders of the
Company as such Superior Proposal, it being understood that the Company shall
not enter into any binding agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal
prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on the third Business Day following
Parent's receipt of such written notification.

            (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this SECTION 5.4, the Company shall no later than 24
hours thereafter advise Parent orally and in writing of any information or of
any inquiry with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of such request, inquiry or Acquisition Proposal and the identity of
the person making such request, inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. The Company
will promptly keep Parent informed of the status and details (including
amendments or changes or proposed amendments or changes) of any such request,
inquiry or Acquisition Proposal.

            (d) Nothing contained in this SECTION 5.4 shall prohibit the Company
complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith
judgment of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company,
after consultation with outside counsel, failure so to disclose would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law; provided, however, that,
subject to SECTION 5.4(b), neither the Company nor its Board of Directors nor
any committee thereof shall make a Change in the Company Board Recommendation
(as defined below) or approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend,
an Acquisition Proposal.

            (e) The Company agrees that it will, and will cause its officers,
directors and representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of the date of this
Agreement with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company agrees that it will use reasonable efforts to promptly
inform its directors, officers, key employees, agents and representatives of the
obligations undertaken in this SECTION 5.4.

      SECTION 5.5.  INFORMATION SUPPLIED.
                    --------------------

            Each of the Company and Parent agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or
its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the proxy
statement on Schedule 14A to be filed with the SEC by the Company in connection
with stockholder approval of the Merger (the "Proxy Statement") will, at the
time the Proxy Statement is mailed to the Company's stockholders and at the time
of the Company Stockholders Meeting (as defined below) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Board of Directors
of the Company shall, subject to SECTION 5.4 and SECTION 5.6 include in the
Proxy Statement its recommendation in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement
(the "Company Board Recommendation") and the written opinion of JP Morgan Chase,
dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of the date hereof, the
Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Company Common Stock.

      SECTION 5.6.  STOCKHOLDERS MEETING.
                    --------------------

                (a) Unless there shall be a Change in the Company Board
Recommendation (as defined below), the Company shall duly take all lawful action
to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders on a
date as soon as reasonably practicable (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") for
the purpose of obtaining the required approval of its stockholders with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall take all lawful
action to solicit the adoption of this Agreement, by the requisite vote of its
stockholders; and the Board of Directors of the Company shall make the Company
Board Recommendation, and shall not withdraw, modify or qualify (or propose to
withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to Parent such recommendation
or the approval of the Merger or this Agreement or take any action or make any
statement in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with
such recommendation or approval (collectively, a "Change in the Company Board
Recommendation"); provided the foregoing shall not prohibit accurate disclosure
(and such disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Change in the Company Board
Recommendation) of material factual information regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of Parent or the Company or the
fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the party
making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal (provided, that the
Board of Directors of the Company does not withdraw, modify or qualify (or
propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to Parent its
recommendation), to the extent such information, facts, identity or terms is
required to be disclosed under applicable law; and, provided further, that the
Board of Directors of the Company may make a Change in the Company Board
Recommendation pursuant to SECTION 5.4 hereof. If there is a Change in the
Company Board Recommendation and/or this Agreement is terminated, this Agreement
need not be submitted to a vote of the Company's stockholders.

                (b) For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in the Company
Board Recommendation shall be deemed to include, without limitation, a
recommendation by the Company Board of Directors of a third party Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company.

      SECTION 5.7.  FILINGS; OTHER ACTIONS; NOTIFICATION.
                    ------------------------------------

             (a) The Company shall (with the cooperation of the Parent) prepare
and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable. Parent and
the Company each shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy
Statement mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable
thereafter.

            (b) The Company and Parent each shall from the date hereof until the
Effective Time cooperate with the other and use its reasonable best efforts to
cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all
documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings,
including the Company providing any notices required under the Connecticut
Property Transfer Act (Conn. Gen. Stat. ss.ss.22A-134 et seq.) and to obtain as
promptly as practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity, including filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, in
order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Parent will advise the Company promptly in respect of any
understandings or arguments which it proposes to make or has made with
applicable federal, state or foreign governmental bodies having jurisdiction
over or rights of review with respect to antitrust law, in connection with the
Merger, and Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to
seek to resolve any objections to the Merger as may be asserted by a
Governmental Entity under applicable laws. If necessary to obtain any regulatory
approval pursuant to any applicable Law, or if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted),
challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of applicable antitrust or competition Law, each of Parent and the
Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and, if necessary, to
(i) obtain any such regulatory approval, (ii) contest and resist any such action
or proceeding or (iii) have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order made or granted pursuant thereto (whether,
temporary, preliminary or permanent), then Parent and its Subsidiaries shall (i)
sell, hold separate, or otherwise dispose of or conduct their business in a
specified manner, (ii) agree to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or
conduct their business in a specified manner, or (iii) permit the sale, holding
separate or other disposition of, any assets of Parent, the Company or their
respective Subsidiaries or the conduct of their business in a specified manner,
provided that in no event will Parent be required hereby to sell, hold separate
or otherwise dispose of any material assets or business or agree to restrict in
any way the conduct of any material business conducted by Parent or proposed to
be conducted by Parent following the Merger.

            (c) The Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

            (d) The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the other,
furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries,
directors, executive officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement or any
other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

      SECTION 5.8.  COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS.
                    ---------------------

            (a) Concurrent with the Effective Time, each Company Option
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the Company Stock Plans shall be assumed by the Parent and shall thereby be
converted into an option (an "Assumed Option") to purchase the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock (decreased to the nearest full share) determined by
multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Conversion
Ratio (as defined below). The exercise price of each Company Option shall also
be adjusted by dividing and rounding up to the nearest whole cent the exercise
price for each share otherwise purchasable pursuant to each Company Option by
the Conversion Ratio. Except for the foregoing adjustments, all the terms and
conditions in effect for each Assumed Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall continue in effect following the assumption of such option in
accordance with this Agreement. "Conversion Ratio" means the Merger
Consideration divided by the average of the closing price per share of the
Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the five consecutive
trading days ending on and including the trading day immediately prior to the
day of the Effective Time.

             (b) It is the intention of the parties that the Company Options so
assumed by Parent shall qualify, immediately after the Effective Time, as
"Incentive Stock Options" under Section 422 of the Code to the same extent those
options qualified as such Incentive Stock Options immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Accordingly, the adjustments provided herein with respect to any
Company Options that are Incentive Stock Options shall be and are intended to be
effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.

            (c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
the exercise of the Assumed Options. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Company Options appropriate notices
setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to such Assumed Options and that
such Assumed Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions
as the Company Options and the applicable Company Stock Plan (subject to the
adjustment set forth in this SECTION 5.8).

            (d) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another
appropriate form) registering a number of shares subject to the Assumed Options.
Such registration statement shall be kept effective (and the current status of
the prospectus required thereby shall be maintained in accordance with the
relevant requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) at least for
so long as any Assumed Options remain outstanding.

      SECTION 5.9.  NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS.
                    -------------------------------

            The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence of any event which would be
likely to cause (i) any representation or warranty made by such Person contained
in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect; or (ii)
any covenant, condition or agreement made by such Person contained in this
Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied; or (iii) any failure of the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;
provided that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this SECTION 5.9 shall not
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to the party receiving such
notice.

      SECTION 5.10.  INDEMNIFICATION.
                     ---------------

            (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees that it will
(i) indemnify and hold harmless, against any costs or expenses (including
attorney's fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and
provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors, officers and
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities)
(individually, an "Indemnified Party" and collectively the "Indemnified
Parties") (a) to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have the right
to advancement of expenses, and to the extent permitted by law, as of the date
of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Company Charter Documents and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof with any
directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (b)
without limitation to clause (a), to the fullest extent permitted by law, in
each case, for acts or omissions at or prior to the Effective Time (including
for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), (ii)
include and cause to be maintained in effect in the Surviving Corporation's (or
any successor's) certificate of incorporation and bylaws for a period of six
years after the Effective Time, the current provisions regarding elimination of
liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses contained in the Company Charter Documents and (iii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain or cause to be maintained for a
period of six years after the Effective Time the current policies of directors'
and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained
by the Company (provided that Parent (or any successor) may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured and
provided further that Parent shall not be required to pay an annual premium
therefor in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid for the Company's
directors' and officers' liability insurance prior to the date of this
Agreement) with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on
or before the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby). Without limiting the rights of any
Indemnified Party set forth in this Section 5.10, such Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to be represented by counsel of its choice reasonably acceptable to
Parent, in any circumstance where the Indemnified Party reasonably believes that
there is an actual or potential conflict of interest between Parent and the
Indemnified Party, and subject to the terms of the then applicable insurance
policies covering the Indemnified Parties, and Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Company to, pay as incurred the reasonable fees and expenses of such
separate counsel, promptly after statements therefor are received. In no event
shall Parent be liable for fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel
and one local counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any one
action or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same
general allegations or facts. No Indemnified Party shall, without the prior
consent of Parent, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
with respect to any claim in respect of which indemnification could be sought
hereunder. The obligations of Parent under this SECTION 5.10 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party to whom this SECTION 5.10 applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the indemnities to whom this
SECTION 5.10 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this SECTION 5.10).

            (b) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such
case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this SECTION 5.10.

      SECTION 5.11.  ACTIONS BY THE PARTIES.
                     ----------------------

            Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to

and filings and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain
an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by any
governmental agency or authority; (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from any other Person; (iii) the defending of any claim,
investigation, action, suit or other legal proceeding, whether judicial or

      SECTION 5.12.  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MATTERS.
                     -------------------------

            (a) From and after the Effective Date, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company and its successors and assigns to honor in accordance with
their terms, all contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and
commitments of the Company and the Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Date that are applicable to any current or former employees or
directors of the Company or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that nothing
contained herein shall prohibit Parent or the Company or any of Parent's
Subsidiaries from amending, modifying or terminating any such contracts,
agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and commitments in accordance with
their terms. Employees of the Company or any Subsidiary shall receive full
credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for
benefit accruals) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
established or maintained by Parent or its successors and assigns after the
Effective Time for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective Time
with the Company or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that such crediting of
service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such
benefit. In addition, Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations
on benefits relating to any pre-existing conditions to the same extent such
limitations are waived under any comparable plan of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and recognize, for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket
limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses
paid by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs.

            (b) As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
the Company and Parent shall confer and work together in good faith to agree
upon mutually acceptable employee benefit and compensation arrangements.

            (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have adopted
resolutions to terminate its Employee Stock Purchase Plan effective with the
last day of the offering period ending December 31, 2002.

            (d) The Company will adopt, or will cause to be adopted. all
necessary corporate resolutions to terminate the Dianon Systems, Inc. 401(k)
Retirement Plan, and any other 401(k) Plan maintained by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, effective as of no later than one day prior to Closing.
Immediately prior to such termination, the Company will make all necessary
payments to fund the contributions: (i) necessary or required to maintain the
tax-qualified status of the 401(k) Plan; (ii) for elective deferrals made
pursuant to the 401(k) Plan for the period prior to termination; and (iii) for
employer matching contributions for the period prior to termination. A 401(k)
Plan means a qualified plan under Code Section 401(a) sponsored and maintained
by the Company or its Subsidiary, which includes a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement, as defined in Section 401(k) of the Code. The Company shall provide
Parent with a copy of resolutions duly adopted by the Company's (or Company
Subsidiary as applicable) board of directors terminating the 401(k) Plan. Parent
will take such steps as are reasonably necessary to ensure that Parent's 401(k)
plan will permit Company employees to make individual rollover contributions to
Parent's 401(k) Plan of any "eligible rollover distributions," as such term is
defined in Parent's 401(k) Plan, distributed by the Company 401(k) Plan.

      SECTION 5.13.  TRANSFER TAXES.
                     --------------

            All stock transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, stamp,
recording and other similar Taxes (including interest, penalties and additions
to any such Taxes (the "Transfer Taxes")) incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by Parent or Merger
Sub, and the Company shall cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub in preparing,
executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

are not obtained.

            (c) LITIGATION. No court or Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any

                        (i) if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or

to terminate this Agreement under this SECTION 7.1(b)(i) shall not be available
to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has

                  (a) Except with respect to the covenants set forth in SECTION
5.3 to keep confidential certain information, this SECTION 7.2, and ARTICLE

termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in
SECTION 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of Parent or the Company or their respective
officers or directors. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company shall be relieved or released
from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful material breach of
this Agreement.

                  (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
(1) SECTION 7.1(b)(iii) in respect of the approval of the stockholders of the
Company not being obtained and prior to the meeting of the Company stockholders
at which a vote is taken to approve this Agreement any Person shall have made or
publicly announced an intention to make a proposal for a Business Combination
with respect to the Company, (2) SECTION 7.1(d), (3) SECTION 7.1(c), or (4)

twelve months of termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with any Person (other than Parent or any of Parent's
Affiliates) with respect to a Business Combination or any Business Combination
with respect to the Company is consummated, then the Company shall pay to
Parent, not later than one Business Day after the earlier of the date such
agreement is entered into or such Business Combination is consummated, a
termination fee of $13,000,000 (the "Termination Fee"), payable by wire transfer
of same day funds, provided, however, that the Termination Fee shall be payable
under clause (b)(3) only if the Business Combination involves a higher price per
share to the Company stockholders than the highest consideration payable by
Parent under this Agreement, (ii) in the case of clause (b)(2) the Company shall
pay to Parent, not later than the date of such termination, one-half of the
Termination Fee and one-half of the Expenses (as defined below, up to $500,000)
and, if within twelve months of such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with any Person (other than Parent or any of Parent's

with respect to the Company is consummated, then the Company shall pay to
Parent, not later than one Business Day after the earlier of the date such
agreement is entered into or such Business Combination is consummated the
remaining one-half of the Termination Fee and the remaining one-half of the
Expenses (with such Expenses not to exceed a cumulative total of $1 million),
and (iii) in the case of clause (b)(4), the Company shall pay to Parent, not
later than the date of such termination, the Termination Fee. The Company
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this SECTION 7.2(b) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amounts due pursuant to
this SECTION 7.2(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a
suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the amounts set forth
in this SECTION 7.2(b), the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amounts set forth in this SECTION 7.2(b) at the
prime rate of Citibank in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made.

                  (c) The Company shall reimburse Parent for all actual out of
pocket expenses incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
up to a maximum amount of $1,000,000 (the "Expenses") in the event this
Agreement is terminated by Parent in the circumstances described in SECTION
7.2(b), and except as set forth to the contrary in SECTION 7.2(b), within two
Business Days after being notified by Parent. All payments made pursuant to this
SECTION 7.2(c) shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds.

Combination" means, with respect to the Company, a transaction with a party
other than Parent or a Subsidiary involving (i) a merger, reorganization,

liquidation, dissolution, or similar transaction involving such party as a
result of which either (A) the Company's stockholders prior to such transaction
in the aggregate cease to own at least 50% of the voting securities of the
entity surviving or resulting from such transaction (or the ultimate parent
entity thereof) or, regardless of the percentage of voting securities held by
such stockholders, if any Person shall beneficially own, directly or indirectly,
at least 40% of the voting securities of such ultimate parent entity or (B) the
individuals comprising the board of directors of the Company prior to such
transaction do not constitute a majority of the board of directors of such
ultimate parent entity, (ii) a sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other
disposition of at least 40% of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions,

ownership of 40% or more of the common stock of the Company whether by merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, tender of exchange offer or

Person).
