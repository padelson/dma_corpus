Purchase Price, minus the Final Net Indebtedness, minus the Final Net Working

Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Final Net Indebtedness is negative

the Closing Date), the foregoing adjustment relating to the Final Net
Indebtedness shall result in an increase of the Aggregate Purchase Price.

amount equal to the Base Purchase Price, minus the Estimated Net Indebtedness,
minus the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment, minus the Estimated CAPEX
Adjustment, minus the Intercompany Loan Assignment Amount, minus the Asset
Transfer Purchase Price, and minus the Estimated Straddle Period Taxes. For

adjustment relating to the Estimated Final Net Indebtedness shall result in an
increase of the Shares Closing Payment.

warranties contained in this Article 5 are true and accurate as of the date

such other date that is specifically provided in this Article 5.

  

  

Disclosures made in the Schedules referred to in this Article 5 in respect of

the Purchaser Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (x) prior to the Closing Date the Seller or

events disclosed in such updated Schedule constitute a Material Adverse Effect
and (y) nevertheless, the Purchaser and the Purchaser Parent pursue and
consummate the Closing, then such updated Schedule shall not be so disregarded
as provided in sub-paragraph (i) above and thus the facts set forth in such

legally binding commitment, other than pursuant to applicable Law, to create
any new Employee Benefit relating to the Business or an employee of the
Business or to amend any existing Employee Benefit in a manner that would
increase the liabilities or obligations with respect to any Employee Benefit
relating to the Business or an employee of the Business.

Without prejudice to Section 5.10.19 above, each Employee Benefit that is an
"employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA,
and that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the I.R.C., has
received a favorable determination letter or IRS opinion letter from the
United States Internal Revenue Service, and there are no existing
circumstances and no events have occurred that would jeopardize the qualified
status of any such Employee Benefit or the related trust. No Group Company or
any "party in interest" or "disqualified person" with respect to any Employee
Benefit has engaged in a material non-exempt "prohibited transaction" within
the meaning of Section 4975 of the I.R.C. or Section 406 of ERISA that could
give rise to any liability on the part of any Group Company or with respect to
any Employee Benefit. No fiduciary has any material liability for breach of
fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply in connection with the
administration or investment of the assets of any Employee Benefit that could
give rise to any liability on the part of any Group Company or with respect to
any Employee Benefit. There is no material violation of ERISA or the I.R.C.

regarding the Employee Benefits with the United States Departments of Labor or
Treasury or the furnishing of such documents to the participants or
beneficiaries of the Employee Benefits that could give rise to any material
liability on the part of any Group Company or Employee Benefit. There are no

Employee Benefits, or against any fiduciary acting with respect to such
Employee Benefits (other than routine benefit claims), nor, to the Knowledge
of the Seller, are there any facts which could form the basis for any such
claim or lawsuit, in each case that could give rise to any liability on the
part of any Group Company or with respect to any Employee Benefit. Terms in
quotation marks in this Section 5.10.20 shall have the meaning set forth in
ERISA or the I.R.C., as the case may be. No Group Company maintains or
contributes to, and has never maintained or contributed to, an Employee
Benefit that is either (i) subject to Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a "multiemployer
plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA or (iii) subject to the
minimum funding standards of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA.
No Employee Benefit is a multiple employer plan within the meaning of Section
413(c) of the Code. No Employee Benefit is a "multiple employer welfare
arrangement" as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA. All amounts required to
have been paid as contributions to any Employee Benefit have been paid within
the time prescribed by applicable Laws and the applicable plan documents. No
Group Companies are or have been delinquent as to premiums, reimbursements,
accruals, contributions or payments to or in respect of any Employee Benefit
or, if there have been such delinquencies, the delinquencies have been
corrected and will not have an adverse effect on any Group Company. With
respect to each Employee Benefit, there are no funded benefit obligations for
which contributions have not been made or properly accrued and there are no
unfunded benefit obligations that have not been accounted for by reserves, or
otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with IFRS, on the financial
statements. The Group Companies have furnished the complete financial
information regarding the funding and present and future liabilities of any
and all deferred compensation, salary continuation, or other Employee Benefit
which are not intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. No
assets of any Group Company are allocated to or held in a "rabbi trust" or
similar funding vehicle. The Group Companies have always been and are now in
compliance with the health care continuation coverage requirements of Section
4980B of the Code and Sections 601-608 of ERISA and any applicable state
health care continuation coverage requirements. No Group Company has incurred
any liability under any Employee Benefit or has made any promises to provide
health or other welfare benefits to current or future retirees or other former
employees of the Group Companies (or to their spouses or dependents) or to
anyone else, except as specifically required by applicable Laws.

Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transaction will constitute an event under any Employee Benefit which (either
alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent event) will or
may (a) entitle any current or former employee, director or consultant of or
with respect to the Business to any payment or benefit (or result in the
funding of any such payment or benefit) or result in any forgiveness of
indebtedness with respect to any such Persons, (b) increase the amount of any
compensation, equity award or other benefits otherwise payable by any Group
Company or with respect to any Included Assets or the Business or (c) result
in the acceleration of the time of payment, funding or vesting of any

(i)

  |  

The amount due in respect of any Indemnifiable Loss will be reduced by the
amount of any compensation payment (such as an insurance recovery actually
received by a Group Company) made to any Group Company, the Purchaser or any
Purchaser Parent Affiliate, if and to the extent such payment relates to such
Indemnifiable Loss, net of any Tax chargeable to such relevant Group Company,
the Purchaser or such Purchaser Parent Affiliate and any reasonable expenses
incurred by any Group Company, the Purchaser or any Purchaser Parent Affiliate
to obtain such proceeds.

amount equal to the Tax Benefit Amount attributable to the Indemnifiable Loss
that gave rise to such indemnity payment, if and to the extent the Tax Benefit
Amount is realized prior to the date on which the indemnification is paid by
the Seller or the Seller Parent in accordance with this Article 7; provided
that, if and to the extent the Tax Benefit Amount is realized after the date
on which such indemnification is paid by the Seller or the Seller Parent, the

recoverable from the Tax authorities or any third party.

Indemnifiable Losses arising in particular from a Tax adjustment resulting
from a delay in the imposition or levy of Tax, or which has the mere effect of
transferring an expense, income or deduction from one financial year to
another or giving rise to a corresponding Tax credit or not giving rise to an
actual payment of Tax or being capable of being deducted from the deductible
losses (reports deficitaires) of any form existing as at or before June 30,
2010 (whether or not such deductible losses are subsequently kept), will only
be taken into account in respect of the associated interest and late payment
penalties due by a Group Company.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(v)

  |  

Indemnifiable Losses shall not include any liability for any Tax to the extent
included in Straddle Period Taxes as calculated in accordance with Annex L,
except for the avoidance of doubt to the extent such Straddle Period Taxes are
increased in excess of the amount calculated pursuant to Annex L as a result
of the imposition of interest, penalties or additions to Tax resulting from a
breach of any covenant or representation or warranty hereunder (e.g.,
penalties assessed due to the failure by any Group Company to pay on or prior
to the Closing Date a Straddle Period Tax when due).

7.2 (Specific Indemnification by the Seller and the Seller Parent) in respect
of any Claim (other than a Claim for breach of the representation set forth in
Section 5.19.5) that relates to any of the Reserved Matters shall be
determined after deduction of an amount, if any, equal to the relevant
Reserved Amount multiplied by the Reserve Deductible Fraction (such amount,
the "Reserve Deductible Amount"). For the avoidance of doubt, any
indemnification claim pursuant to Section 7.1(i) that is subject to this
Section 7.3(vi) will also be subject to the limitations set forth in Section
7.4.1.

   
---|---|---

Indemnifiable Loss.

  |  

(viii)

  |  

Neither the Seller nor the Seller Parent shall be required to indemnify the
Purchaser for the amount of any increase in any Indemnifiable Loss to the
extent such increase is caused by the failure of the Purchaser to take
commercially reasonable actions to mitigate damages after the Purchaser became
aware of the event or omissions that caused such Indemnifiable Loss (it being
understood that the concept of mitigation of damages shall be applied with
regard to what is commercially reasonable under the circumstances).

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(ix)

  |  

Neither the Seller nor the Seller Parent will be liable for any
indemnification payment under Article 7 (Indemnification) to the extent the
relevant Indemnifiable Loss arises from the entry into effect or the
modification of a law, decret or rule, or the entry into effect or the
modification of any new Tax after the date of execution of this Agreement even
if this entry into effect is given a retroactive effect. Similarly, neither
the Seller nor the Seller Parent will be liable for any indemnification
payment under Article 7 to the extent the Indemnifiable Loss arises from a
change after the date hereof in the interpretation made by the courts or the
administration of a solution admitted until the date hereof.

The Seller Parent shall, within sixty (60) days after the date of receipt of a

accepts or disputes the Claim set forth in the Claim Notice, and if it rejects

The Seller Parent shall regularly inform the Purchaser of the progress of the
defense to the Third-Party Claim and of all material developments and events
relating to such Third-Party Claim by providing the Purchaser with all
evidence or documents which the Purchaser may reasonably request and shall
provide the Purchaser with an opportunity to review and comment on any
material correspondence before the Seller or the Seller Parent sends such
correspondence to any third party. The Seller Parent shall not settle the
Third-Party Claim without the Purchaser's prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, that no such prior consent shall
be required for a settlement of such Third-Party Claim providing exclusively
for the payment of money damages and which is not otherwise materially adverse

obligation to indemnify the Purchaser in respect of the Third-Party Claim, and
if the Seller Parent shall not have opted hereunder to assume the defense of
such Third-Party Claim, in the absence of an enforceable judgment (jugement
ayant autorite de la chose jugee), no payment, settlement, or compromise
related to an Indemnifiable Loss shall be made without the prior consent of

scope and activity restrictions of this covenant not to compete are
reasonable. In the event a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the

therefor, it is expressly agreed that this covenant not to compete shall be
construed so that the remaining provisions shall not be affected, but shall
remain in full force and effect, and any such over broad provisions shall be
deemed, without further action on the part of any Person, to be modified,
amended and/or limited, but only to the extent necessary to render the same
valid and enforceable in such jurisdiction but shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms in all other jurisdictions unless so
modified by a court of competent jurisdiction within such other jurisdiction.

otherwise refiled, any Tax Filing that was filed by a Group Company relating

modifying or otherwise refiling any such Pre-Closing Period Tax Filing (that
it believes is required to be amended, modified or refiled under applicable
law) shall promptly provide to the Seller Parent written notice of its intent
to amend, modify or otherwise refile such Tax Filing, which notice shall
include the legal basis supporting the conclusion that such Tax Filing is
required to be amended, modified or refiled under applicable Law, provided,

recognized law firm experienced in Tax matters that states that such
amendment, modification or refiling relating to such position should not be
required by Law. The Purchaser Parent shall, and shall cause the Group
Companies to cooperate with the Seller Parent, including by providing any
information reasonably requested, relating to amending, modifying or refiling
Pre-Closing Period Tax Filing. Neither the Purchaser nor any Purchaser Parent

in the ordinary course of business) that would reasonably be expected to
result in any increase in Tax liability (or a reduction in a Tax refund or
credit) in respect of a Pre-Closing Period of a Group Company, in each case
without obtaining the prior consent of the Seller Parent, then the Seller
Parent and the Seller shall not be required to indemnify hereunder to the

the Purchaser Parent to so notify the Seller Parent shall relieve the Seller
Parent or the Seller of any liability for Indemnifiable Losses hereunder

as a consequence of such failure.
