conditions contained in this Agreement, on the Closing Date at the Closing
Place and effective 12:01 A.M. on the Closing Date (i) Sellers shall sell,
assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall
purchase from the applicable Seller, their respective rights and title in and
to the SLSJ Assets, (ii) Sellers shall assign and deliver to Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall accept assignment from the applicable Seller of, and assume
the Assumed Obligations under, the Contracts, (iii) Sellers shall transfer
and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall assume, the Assumed
Obligations, and The Ladue News, Inc. shall transfer and deliver to Journal

Consideration. For and in full consideration of the assignments, conveyances
and transfers described herein, and in consideration of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, Purchaser shall:  
(1) Pay to Sellers for the SLSJ Assets the aggregate sum of One Hundred Sixty
Five Million and No/100ths Dollars ($165,000,000) (the "PURCHASE PRICE"),
increased or decreased by the Purchase Price Adjustment as provided in
Section 14, of which an amount to be reasonably determined by the parties in
good faith prior to the Closing Date shall be allocated as consideration for
the non-competition agreement referenced in Section 6.1(n); and   (2)
Assume the Assumed Obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the Assignment and Assumption Agreement set forth as Exhibit A
hereto.   In addition, the net amount of the adjustments required pursuant
to Sections 11 and 14, to the extent determinable on the Closing Date, shall
be separately paid by Purchaser to Sellers or Sellers to Purchaser, as
the case may be, by wire transfer at the Closing, with final settlement
within thirty (30) days after the end of the third full monthly accounting or
billing period after the Closing.   To the extent that the transfer or
assignment hereunder by the Sellers to the Purchaser of any SLSJ Assets is
not permitted or is not permitted without the consent of another party, this
Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute an undertaking to transfer or
assign the same if such consent is not given or if such an undertaking
otherwise would constitute a breach thereof.   2.3 Payment of Purchase
Price. At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay the Purchase Price, plus the
estimated amount of Working Capital, to Sellers by wire transfer of Federal
funds in    -11-  20  accordance with instructions of Sellers delivered
to Purchaser not less than two business days before the Closing Date.   2.4
Labor Agreement; Employees. (a) Purchaser agrees to recognize the Graphic
Communications International Union Local 505-M (the "UNION") as the
representative of the Suburban Journal employees who are covered under
Section 6.1 of the labor agreement (the "LABOR AGREEMENT") between Suburban
Newspapers of Greater St. Louis and the Union, assuming that the
Union continues its majority status, and subject to the provisions of Section
5.4 in the case of the Labor Agreement.   (1) Purchaser shall, as of the
Closing Date, offer continued employment, with comparable compensation and
benefit packages (in the aggregate), excluding any equity-based compensation,
as given by Sellers as of the Closing Date, to all employees of Sellers and
The Ladue News, Inc. with respect to the Suburban Journals, other than Thomas
E. Rice, as of the Closing Date (the "SLSJ EMPLOYEES"). Each SLSJ Employee
who continues such employment after the Closing will become a "TRANSFERRED
EMPLOYEE." Transferred Employees shall be given credit for prior service with
Journal Register, Sellers or any of their affiliates for purposes of
determining eligibility of such employees to participate in or seniority
under any of Purchaser\'s employee benefits.   2.5 Allocation of Purchase
Price. The amount of the Purchase Price and the Assumed Obligations shall be
allocated among the SLSJ Assets in accordance with the applicable
requirements of Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder. Purchaser and Sellers agree, for both tax and financial
accounting purposes, to use commercially reasonable efforts to agree, at
least thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, upon
an allocation of the amount of the Purchase Price and the Assumed Obligations
among the SLSJ Assets (the "ALLOCATION") and report the purchase and sale of
the SLSJ Assets in a manner consistent with the Allocation, subject to the
adjustment, if any, required under Section 14 and taking into account their
respective tax and financial accounting methods and practices. In the event
Purchaser and Sellers are unable to agree upon the Allocation at least thirty
(30) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, then Purchaser and Sellers
shall cause an appraisal of the SLSJ Assets (the "APPRAISAL") to be performed
by a qualified appraisal firm to be mutually agreed upon by them, and the
Appraisal shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties for purposes of
the Allocation. The cost of the Appraisal shall be shared equally by
Purchaser, on one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand. In the event Sellers
and Purchaser cannot mutually agree upon the selection of a qualified
appraisal firm at least twenty (20) days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date after negotiation in good faith, each party may determine and proceed to
use its own allocation of the amount of the Purchase Price and the Assumed
Obligations among the SLSJ Assets for both tax and accounting purposes.
Purchaser and Sellers will comply with the applicable information reporting
requirements of Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder. If any taxing authority makes or proposes an allocation with
respect to the SLSJ Assets that differs materially from that contained in the
Allocation, Purchaser and Sellers shall each have the right, at such party\'s
election and expense, to contest such taxing authority\'s determination. In
the event of such a contest, the other party agrees to cooperate    -12- 
21 reasonably with the contesting party, but shall have the right to
file such protective claims or returns as may be reasonably required to
protect its interest.   2.6 Like Kind Exchange. Sellers are considering the
disposition of the SLSJ Assets through a qualified intermediary within the
meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) for the purpose of effecting
a like kind exchange (an "EXCHANGE") within the meaning of Section 1031 of
the Code. If Sellers decide to effect an Exchange, Sellers may, in their sole
discretion, notify Purchaser in writing, and Purchaser agrees to cooperate
with Sellers, if requested by Sellers, to structure the disposition of the
SLSJ Assets as an Exchange; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be
obligated to incur any additional cost, liability (including warranty or
other liability) or expense (including the reasonable expenses of its counsel
in advising and representing Purchaser with respect to structuring the
disposition of the SLSJ Assets as an Exchange), and is held harmless by
Sellers against any loss, liability or expense, arising as a result of the
intended Exchange or any challenge to, or failure of, the disposition of the
SLSJ Assets hereunder to qualify as an Exchange. The ability or inability of
Sellers to structure the disposition of the SLSJ Assets as an Exchange shall
not be a condition precedent to, and shall not under any circumstances
constitute a cause for the delay of, the Closing. In connection with an
Exchange, all of Sellers\' respective representations, warranties, covenants,
rights and obligations hereunder shall remain with Sellers, and Sellers shall
transfer legal title to the SLSJ Assets directly over to Purchaser. In the
event of any dispute regarding the SLSJ Assets, the transactions contemplated
hereby or Sellers\' respective obligations hereunder, Purchaser may look
solely to the Journal Register Parties with respect to resolving any such
dispute.   3. Representations and Warranties of Journal Register

Register Parties of the standard client representation letter required by
Statement on Auditing Standards No. 19. Prior to any such review, Purchaser
shall take all     -37-    46 reasonable steps to ensure that all
materials disclosed to and derived by Deloitte and Touche with respect to such
review shall be kept confidential. The Journal Register Parties shall request
and consent to Deloitte and Touche\'s reviewing the working papers of the
Journal Register Parties\' auditors in connection with the aforementioned
audit.   (5) Antitrust Compliance.    (1) As promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement,  and in no event later than June 30, 2000,
the Journal Register Parties  shall file with the Federal Trade Commission

8.1 Efforts of the Parties. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, each party hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as
promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser and
the Journal Register Parties (i) diligently shall take, and cooperate in the
taking of, all necessary, desirable and proper steps, provide any additional
information reasonably required, and otherwise use reasonable best efforts to
obtain promptly all necessary clearances from the U.S. Department of Justice,

governmental entity (each a "REGULATORY ENTITY") of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) shall defend through litigation on
the merits any antitrust, trade regulation or competition claim asserted in
any court by any Regulatory Entity, including, but not limited to, defending

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The foregoing shall not
be deemed to require Purchaser to enter into any agreement, consent decree or
other commitment requiring Purchaser or any of its affiliates to divest or
hold separate or to take any other action that would have a material adverse
effect upon the financial condition, business or operations of Purchaser
after giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein or the financial
condition, business or operations of St. Louis Post Dispatch LLC.   (b) The
Purchaser and Journal Register shall keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby
and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining consents of any
Regulatory Entity, including, without limitation: (i) promptly notifying the
other of, and if in writing, furnishing the other with copies of (or, in
the case of material oral communications, advise the other orally of)
any communications from or with any Regulatory Entity with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) permitting the other
party to review and discuss in advance, and considering in good faith the
views of one another in connection with, any proposed written (or any
material proposed oral) communication with any Regulatory Entity, (iii) not

-40-    49     it consults with the other party in advance and to the
extent permitted by such Regulatory Entity gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat, (iv) furnishing the other
party with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and
memoranda setting forth substance thereof) between it and any Regulatory
Entity with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (v) furnishing the other party with such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably
request in connection with its preparation of necessary filings or
submissions of information to any Regulatory Entity. The Purchaser and
Journal Register may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under
this Section 8.1 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside
legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (the
Purchaser or Journal Register as the case may be) or its legal counsel.  
8.2 Public Announcements. The parties will issue separate press releases,
which shall be reasonably acceptable to the parties, promptly following the
execution of this Agreement. Prior to the Closing Date none of the Journal
Register Parties nor Pulitzer or Purchaser shall, without the prior written
approval of the other party, make any additional press release or
other public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement except to the extent that either party shall be so obligated by law
or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, in which case the other party
shall be advised and the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Journal Register Parties, Pulitzer and
Purchaser understand, acknowledge and agree that each of Journal Register and
Pulitzer is a publicly-traded company and, as such, may be required to
disclose this transaction, the terms thereof and information relating to the
Suburban Journals and the SLSJ Assets by one or more filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission or other federal or state regulating
bodies or with the New York Stock Exchange. To the extent possible, each
party will give the other prior notice of, and an opportunity to review, any
such disclosure.   8.3 Further Assurances. Each party shall, at any time and
from time to time after the Closing Date, upon request of any other party,
do, execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be done, executed,
acknowledged and delivered, all such further acts, instruments, assignments
and assurances as may be reasonably required in order to carry out the intent
of this Agreement. Any Excluded Asset received by Purchaser following the
Closing Date shall promptly be remitted to Sellers. Any SLSJ Asset received
by any Journal Register Parties following the Closing Date shall promptly be
remitted to Purchaser.   8.4 Environmental Studies. Following the execution
of this Agreement, Purchaser may order a Phase I environmental assessment
(the "STUDY") of the Real Property from a nationally recognized engineer (the
"ENGINEER"). Any Study will be addressed to Purchaser and will be conducted
at the expense of Purchaser. If the Study reveals information which in the
judgment of Engineer and Purchaser warrants a further investigation of the
Real Property (a "PHASE II STUDY"), to be completed not later than ninety
(90) days after the date of this Agreement,     -41-  
50    Purchaser shall have the right to order a Phase II Study as to such
aspects of the Real Property and the estimated Environmental Remediation Cost
as Purchaser may request, the cost of which Phase II Study shall be borne by
Purchaser. Purchaser shall give two (2) days prior written notice to Seller
before commencing any Phase II Study. The Journal Register Parties shall
furnish the Engineer access to the Real Property and all information
concerning the Real Property as it may reasonably request in order to enable
the Engineer to make such examinations and investigations thereof as it shall
deem necessary to complete the Study and any Phase II Study; provided,
however, that the Study and any Phase II Study shall be conducted in a manner
that does not materially interfere with or disrupt the business of the
Journal Register Parties or any of the Suburban Journals or cause damage in
any material respect to any assets of the Journal Register Parties and the
Journal Register Parties shall receive copies and have reasonable opportunity
to comment upon any and all draft and final reports with respect to any Study
or Phase II Study contemporaneously with its delivery to Purchaser.   8.5
Insurance Matters. Purchaser anticipates that it may obtain prior to Closing
(i) a "tail" policy to the Sellers\' directors\' and officers\' insurance
policy (as referenced on Schedule 3.17) if necessary to continue in effect
for the benefit of Purchaser the coverage, if any, under such insurance with
respect to claims, causes of action and litigation arising or occurring prior
to Closing under such insurance and (ii) modifications or "nose" policies to
Purchaser\'s existing liability insurance policies (other than libel,
if necessary), each with respect to claims relating to matters occurring
prior to Closing that have not been reported as of the Closing Date. Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Purchaser in obtaining
such modifications or the policies, and Purchaser agrees to reimburse the
Journal Register Parties for any premiums or other costs and expenses
required to be paid by them in connection therewith and in no event will the
Journal Register Parties be responsible for any deductibles in connection
therewith. The Journal Register Parties and Purchaser shall execute and
deliver such further instruments and certificates and other documents as each
may reasonably request in order to more effectively obtain the insurance
modifications referenced above (including libel modifications or
policies).   9. Termination. In the event that the Closing has not occurred
on or before October 25, 2000 (or March 25, 2001, if all applicable
antitrust clearances have not been obtained by October 25, 2000), then either
Journal Register or Purchaser, provided neither it or its affiliates is then
in material breach of their respective obligations under this Agreement, may
terminate this Agreement without liability or further obligation. No such
termination shall relieve any party then in material breach of its
obligations under this Agreement from any liability therefor.   10.
Instruments of Conveyance and Transfer.   10.1 Instruments of Conveyance and
Transfer of Real Property. At the Closing, to effect the transfers,
conveyances or assignments from Sellers to Purchaser as herein provided,
Sellers shall execute and deliver to Purchaser (and Purchaser shall execute
and deliver where necessary to reflect its assumption of any Assumed
Contracts including, without limitation, any leasehold interests) one or more
deeds and assignments, assigning, transferring and conveying
to          -42-   51    Purchaser good and marketable title to
all the Real Property, subject only to the permitted exceptions, including
all leasehold and option interests, as set forth under this Agreement, all in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to counsel for Purchaser or, in
the case of the assumption of Assumed Contracts, in the form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to counsel for Sellers, and dated the Closing Date,
as follows:   (1) general warranty deeds in recordable form appropriate
for Missouri or Illinois, as the case may be, to all Real Property,
excluding leasehold interests;   (2) assignment and assumption agreements
of all right, title and interest of the applicable Seller in and under all
leases and in its leasehold interests in Real Property, including all rights
under the lease agreements referred to in Schedule 1.21(a) hereto;   (3)
consents, if any, required of any lessors under any leases to the assignments
described in clause (b) above; and   (4) such other instruments, affidavits
or documents as Purchaser may reasonably request or as may be reasonably
required by its title insurers in connection with the transfer to Purchaser
of the Real Property or the elimination from any commitments for title
insurance obtained by Purchaser of any exceptions inconsistent with the
obligations of Seller under this Agreement.   10.2 Instruments of Conveyance
and Transfer of Personal Property. At the Closing, to effect the transfers,
conveyances and assignments from Sellers to Purchaser as herein provided,
Sellers shall execute and deliver to Purchaser the following bills of sale,
certificates, assignments and other instruments of transfer assigning,
transferring and conveying to Purchaser good and marketable title to all of
the personal property to be transferred hereunder, free and clear of all
mortgages, pledges, claims, liens, charges and any other encumbrances except
as permitted under this Agreement, all in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to counsel for Purchaser, and dated the Closing Date:   (1)
assignment and assumption agreements of all leases and leasehold interests in
personal property, including all rights under the lease agreements referred
to in Schedule 1.21(b) hereto;   (2) bill(s) of sale for all tangible
personal property;   (3) assignment of all transferable Governmental
Authorizations for the Suburban Journals;   (4) assignments of all
contracts and other intangible assets to be transferred pursuant to this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the SLSJ Assets described in
Section 1.21(f-1) and Section 1.21(g) of this Agreement;       
-43-   52     (5) motor vehicle title certificates;   (6) the
certificate or certificates representing all of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of The Ladue News, Inc., together with duly executed stock
powers; and   (7) such other instruments or documents as Purchaser
may reasonably request in connection with the transfer to it of the
personal property to be transferred, not inconsistent with the obligations of
the Journal Register Parties under this Agreement.   11. Capital Items.
Should any Seller or The Ladue News, Inc., subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, purchase or commit to purchase any tangible, capital asset (other
than replacement items, for which there shall be no adjustment), the
aggregate amount payable to Sellers pursuant to Section 2.2 above shall be
increased in the amount, if any, of the purchase price of that asset actually
paid by Sellers prior to the Closing (and Purchaser shall assume any
remaining liability therefor), provided Purchaser has previously consented in
writing to the purchase or acquisition thereof by Sellers or The Ladue
News, Inc., as the case may be. If any of the tangible assets described in
Schedule 1.21(b) hereto (other than Excluded Assets and those replaced or
expended in the ordinary course of business) is disposed of by Sellers or The
Ladue News, Inc. other than in conformity with Section 5.7, the aggregate
amount payable to Sellers pursuant to Section 2.2 above shall be decreased in
the amount of the replacement cost for a comparable asset.   12. Risk of
Loss. The risk of any loss, damage, impairment, confiscation or condemnation
of the SLSJ Assets or any part thereof from fire or any other casualty or
cause shall be borne by Sellers at all times prior to the Closing Date. In
any such event, the proceeds of, or any claim for any loss payable under, any
insurance policy, judgment or award with respect thereto shall be paid to
Sellers, which shall repair, replace or restore any such SLSJ Assets as soon
as possible after its loss, impairment, confiscation or condemnation or, in
the event Sellers shall not so repair, replace or restore any such SLSJ
Assets, Sellers shall remit such proceeds, if any, or the right to receive
such proceeds to Purchaser.   13. Books and Records of Suburban Journals. At
Closing, Purchaser shall be entitled to all records, books of account, files,
documents and correspondence relating specifically to or necessary for the
proper operation of each of the Suburban Journals (other than Excluded
Assets); provided, however, that Purchaser shall retain and make available
for inspection by Journal Register and its representatives for any reasonable
purpose all such records, books of account, files, documents and
correspondence, and Purchaser shall not dispose of, alter or destroy any such
materials without giving thirty (30) days prior written notice to Journal
Register so that Journal Register may, at its expense, examine, make copies
of, or take possession of such materials. Journal Register shall be entitled
to retain all records, books of account, files, documents and correspondence
relating to the Excluded Assets and which also relate to the Suburban
Journals, but only as part of the overall corporate records of Journal
Register and are unnecessary for the proper operation of each of the Suburban
Journals, subsequent to the Closing Date; provided, however, that Journal
Register shall make available for inspection by Purchaser and
its representatives for any reasonable purpose     -44-    53   all
such records, books of account, files, documents and
correspondence (including without limitation copies of federal, state, county
and local Tax Returns that relate to the SLSJ Assets or the Suburban Journals
), and Journal Register shall not dispose of, alter or destroy any such
materials without giving thirty (30) days prior written notice to Purchaser
so that Purchaser may, at its expense, examine, make copies of, or take
possession of such materials.   14. Purchase Price Adjustment.   (1)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Purchase Price
shall be adjusted upward or downward, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the
amount of the Working Capital (the "PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT"). The Working
Capital shall be estimated by Journal Register, to the best of its abilities,
based on a date which is not more than thirty-five (35) days prior to the
Closing and, to the extent reasonably possible, is the last day of
an accounting or billing period (the "ESTIMATE DATE"), and such estimate
shall be used to compute the Purchase Price Adjustment at Closing.   (2)
Within thirty (30) days after the end of the third full monthly accounting or
billing period after the Closing, representatives of the Journal Register
Parties and Purchaser shall jointly determine the actual amount of the
Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the "CLOSING DATE WORKING
CAPITAL AMOUNT"). Upon certification of such amounts jointly by such
representatives, the parties shall within five (5) business days make such
further payments between themselves as may be necessary in order to take
account of the Closing Date Working Capital Amount as jointly determined by
said representatives; provided, however, that if any dispute arises over any
item reflected in or omitted from the Closing Date Working Capital Amount or
the amount to be refunded or paid, such refund or payment net of any disputed
amount shall nonetheless be promptly made to the extent such amount is not in
dispute. Any such refund or payment shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the party to which such refund or payment is
due.   (3) In the event that the representatives of the Journal
Register Parties and Purchaser are unable to agree with respect to any
determination of the Closing Date Working Capital Amount within thirty (30)
days after the end of the third full accounting or billing period after the
Closing, the Journal Register Parties and Purchaser hereby agree that such
determination shall be referred to a mutually satisfactory independent public
accounting firm of national stature which has not been employed by any party
hereto for the two years preceding the date of such referral (the "SELECTED
ACCOUNTANTS"), which shall promptly make a determination. The determination
of the Selected Accountants shall be conclusive and binding on each party.
One-half of the fees of the Selected Accountants shall be borne by Journal
Register, and one-half shall be borne by Purchaser. Purchaser shall be
required to refund any portion of any estimated Purchase Price Adjustment
amount received by Purchaser at Closing pursuant to Section 2.2 which is
determined under this Section 14 to be in excess of the amount due
Purchaser.   15. Certain Employee Benefit Matters.       -45-  
54    (1) Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 15(b) with
respect to the assumption of certain retiree and COBRA obligations, Purchaser
does not and will not assume the sponsorship of, the responsibility for
contributions to, or any liability in connection with, any Employee Plan.  
(2) Purchaser shall assume and be responsible for (i) the retiree obligations
to Frank Bick, Bill Mullins, Howard Etling and Jane Floerchinger and their
respective spouses, as set forth in Schedule 15(b) and (ii) the obligation to
provide future COBRA continuation coverage to former employees of
the Suburban Journals, the SLSJ Employees and in both cases their covered
dependents who become eligible for such coverage as a result of termination
of employment by Sellers or The Ladue News, Inc.   16. Certain Tax
Matters.   16.1 Tax Returns Through Closing. The Journal Register
Parties and Purchaser shall each prepare and file on a timely basis all
federal, state, county, local and foreign Tax Returns relating to the
Suburban Journals and their operation and the SLSJ Assets as such party is
required to file by applicable law. Journal Register shall be responsible for
preparing any Tax Return for The Ladue News, Inc. in respect of a period
ended on or before the Closing Date but not due to be filed until after the
Closing Date. In the case of Tax Returns and the payment of Taxes for The
Ladue News, Inc. in respect of any period beginning before and ending after
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be filed such Tax Return and shall pay or cause to be paid when due
all Taxes in respect of such period; provided, however, that Journal Register
shall pay to Purchaser, within ten (10) days after Purchaser\'s written
request therefor, an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates
to the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date to the extent such
portion is not reflected in the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) of The Ladue News, Inc. which is taken into account for
purposes of determining the Closing Date Working Capital Amount pursuant to
Section 14. If Journal Register and Purchaser do not agree on the Taxes
Journal Register is required to pay in respect of a period beginning before
and ending after the Closing Date, Purchaser and Journal Register
shall select a national accounting firm to make the final determination of
the Taxes owed by Journal Register. If Journal Register and Purchaser do not
agree on a national accounting firm, each shall select a national accounting
firm and the national accounting firms shall select a third national
accounting firm which is not engaged and has not been engaged for the prior
two years by either Purchaser or Journal Register or any of their affiliates.
The third national accounting firm shall make the final determination. The
costs for the accounting firms shall be borne by the party whose
determination of the amount of Taxes owed by Journal Register in respect of a
period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date deviates more from
the final determination of the third national accounting firm. For purposes
of this Section 16.1, in the case of any Taxes payable for a period which
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Taxes
which relates to the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date shall
(a) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income
or receipts, be deemed       -46-   55   to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire period, and (b) in
the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed
equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant period ended on
the Closing Date. Any credits relating to a period that begins before
and ends after the Closing Date shall be taken into account as though such
period ended on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect
to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practice of The Ladue News, Inc. The Journal Register Parties and Purchaser
shall each cooperate with the other in the preparation of such Tax Returns
and shall each provide to the party making any filing all information and
access to all records relating to any of the Suburban Journals and the SLSJ
Assets necessary in order for the prompt and accurate filing of such Tax
Returns.   16.2 Subsequent Liability. If, on or subsequent to the
Closing Date, any liability for Taxes relating to any of the Suburban
Journals, their operation or the SLSJ Assets is imposed on Purchaser or The
Ladue News, Inc. with respect to any period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, including, without limitation, any liability for Missouri or Illinois
sales Tax in respect of the operation of any of the Suburban Journals or the
ownership of the SLSJ Assets on or prior to the Closing Date (but excluding
any liability for Missouri or Illinois sales or realty transfer Taxes payable
in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby), then, except to the
extent such liability is included in the Closing Date Working Capital Amount,
the Journal Register Parties shall indemnify and hold Purchaser and The Ladue
News, Inc. harmless from and against, and shall pay, the full amount of such
Tax liability (as well as reasonable attorneys\' or other fees and
disbursements of Purchaser or The Ladue News, Inc. incurred in determination
thereof or in connection therewith) in accordance with the provisions of
Section 19 and Section 16.7 hereof. In determining the amount of any
indemnification payment pursuant to this Section 16.2, there shall be
deducted or added, respectively, from or to the amount to be paid an amount
equal to (a) the present value of any net Tax benefit (federal, state,
county, local or foreign) realized, or reasonably expected to be realized, by
Purchaser, any of its affiliates or The Ladue News, Inc. as a consequence of
such payment, and (b) the present value of any net Tax detriment (federal,
state, county, local or foreign) realized, or reasonably expected
to realized, by Purchaser, any of its affiliates or The Ladue News, Inc. as
a consequence of the receipt of any such payment. For purposes of this
Section 16.2, "present value" shall be calculated using the applicable annual
Federal mid-term rate, as that term is defined in the Code, as in effect for
the month in which the payment is to be made, and the amount of any "Tax
benefit" or "Tax detriment" shall be calculated using the highest effective
Tax rate applicable or known to be applicable with respect to the period or
periods for which the Tax benefit or the Tax detriment, as the case may be,
is reasonably expected to be realized or incurred.   16.3 Survival of Tax
Indemnification Provisions. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, the obligation of the Journal Register Parties to indemnify and
hold harmless Purchaser under Section 16.2 of this Agreement shall begin on
the Closing Date and end upon the later of (i) the expiration of the statute
of limitations applicable to the assessment and collection of Taxes for which
the Journal Register Parties are obligated to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to
Section 16.2 of this Agreement, or (ii) with respect to an eligible claim,
upon the ultimate   -47-     56     disposition of such claim.
Neither Purchaser, on the one hand, nor any of the Journal Register Parties,
on the other hand, may agree to extend any statute of limitations applicable
to the assessment and collection of Taxes for which the Journal Register
Parties are obligated to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to Section 19(b) of
this Agreement without the consent of the other, not to be unreasonably
withheld.   16.4 Tax Audits. Purchaser shall notify Journal Register
in writing of any pending or threatened audit or examination by any Tax
authority (a "TAX AUDIT") or a Tax assessment for which Purchaser or The
Ladue News, Inc. may be entitled to indemnification under Section 16.2 hereof
as soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than thirty (30) days after
Purchaser\'s receipt of notice of such pending or threatened Tax Audit or
assessment. Journal Register shall have the right, at its own expense, to
control any Tax Audit, initiate any claim for refund, contest, resolve and
defend against any assessment, notice of deficiency or other adjustment or
proposed adjustment relating to any and all Taxes for any period of any of
the Journal Register Parties and The Ladue News, Inc. ending on or before the
Closing Date; provided, however, that Journal Register shall in no event take
any position in any such proceeding which would subject Purchaser, any of its
affiliates or The Ladue News, Inc. to any civil fraud or any civil or
criminal penalty, and provided, further, that Journal Register shall not
consent, without the prior written approval of Purchaser, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, to any change in the treatment of any item which would
in any manner affect the Tax liability of Purchaser, any of its affiliates or
The Ladue News, Inc. for a period subsequent to the Closing Date. Purchaser
shall have the right, at its expense, to control any other Tax Audit,
initiate any other claim for refund, and contest, resolve and defend against
any other assessment, notice of deficiency or other adjustment or proposed
adjustment relating to Taxes for any period ending after the Closing Date
with respect to the operation of any of the Suburban Journals, the ownership
of the SLSJ Assets or The Ladue News, Inc.   16.5 Sales and Transfer Taxes.
All sales and transfer Taxes (including realty and stock transfer Taxes, if
any) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be borne equally by the Journal Register Parties,
on one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand. The Journal Register Parties
shall, at their own expense, file or prepare for filing all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such sales or transfer
Taxes, and, if required by applicable law or if necessary to secure any
applicable exemption, Purchaser shall join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns or other documentation.   16.6 Mutual Cooperation. The parties shall
provide each other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by any
of them in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, any Tax Audit
or other examination by any Tax authority, or any judicial or administrative
proceedings relating to Taxes, and each will retain and provide the other
with any records or information that may be relevant to such Tax Return, Tax
Audit or examination, proceedings or determination. Such assistance shall
include making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder and
shall include providing copies of any relevant Tax Returns and supporting
work schedules. The party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse the
other for reasonable expenses incurred in      -48-   
57     providing such assistance. Without limiting in any way the
foregoing provisions of this Section 16, each of the Journal Register
Parties, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, hereby agrees to
retain, until the appropriate statutes of limitation (including any
extensions) expire, copies of all Tax Returns, supporting work schedules and
other records or information that may be relevant to such Tax Returns of any
of the Journal Register Parties and the Ladue News, Inc. for all periods that
include the dates from January 1, 1993 to the Closing Date, inclusive, and
that it will not destroy or otherwise dispose of such records without first
providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and copy
such records.   16.7 Limitations. The Taxes for which Sellers have agreed in
this Section 16 to indemnify Purchaser, its affiliates and The Ladue News,
Inc. shall be treated as Losses under the provisions of Section 19 and are
governed by the provisions of Section 19.   17. Brokers. Journal Register
has engaged Dirks, Van Essen and Murray in connection with this transaction and
shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of such firm. Each party
represents and warrants to the other that neither it nor any of its
affiliates has engaged any other broker, finder or consultant in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein or any aspect
thereof. Each party agrees to indemnify and hold the others harmless from any
and all loss, cost, liability, damage and expense (including legal and other
expenses incident thereto) in respect of any claim for a broker, finder or
consultant\'s fee or commission or similar payment by virtue of any alleged
agreements, arrangements or understandings with the indemnifying party or any
of its affiliates. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Section 17
shall survive the Closing Date without limitation.   18. Notices. Any
notice, request, demand or consent required or permitted to be given under
this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally or
telecopied, or sent by certified, registered or express mail or by Federal
Express or similar courier service, postage prepaid, and shall be deemed

Representations and Warranties; Indemnification.    (1) The several
representations and warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties
contained in this Agreement (or in any document delivered in connection
herewith) shall be deemed to have been made on the date of this Agreement and
on the Closing Date, shall be deemed to be material and to have been relied
upon by Purchaser or Sellers, as the case may be, notwithstanding the Closing
of the transactions contemplated hereby or any investigation made by
Purchaser or Sellers, shall survive the Closing Date and, except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Agreement, shall remain operative and in full
force and effect for a period of two years following the Closing Date, except
as to any matters with respect to which a bona fide written claim shall have
been made or an action at law or in equity shall have commenced before such
date, in which event survival shall continue (but only with respect to, and
to the extent of, such claim) until the final resolution of such claim or
action, including all applicable periods for appeal; provided, however,
that the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.5 (Title to
SLSJ Assets) shall survive until the expiration of the statute of
limitations applicable to claims with respect to the matters covered by such
representations and warranties and the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.20 (Taxes) shall survive for the period specified in
Section 16.3.   (2) Journal Register and each Seller jointly and severally
shall indemnify and hold Purchaser and its affiliates, officers,
directors, stockholders, employees, agents and successors and assigns
harmless from and against:   (1) any and all loss, cost, liability, damage
and expense  (including legal and other expenses incident thereto) (a
"LOSS")  arising out of or resulting from any inaccuracy, misrepresentation
or  breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of 
Journal Register or Sellers under this Agreement (including the  Schedules
and Exhibits hereto); provided, however, that for purposes  of this Section
19(b), all such representations, warranties, covenants  and agreements of the
Journal Register or Sellers, other than the  representations and warranties
in Section 3.11, the third sentence of  Section 3.22 and Section 3.23 shall
be deemed to have been made by the  Journal Register or Sellers without any
qualification as to MAE,  materiality or Knowledge;   (2) any and all
liability of the Suburban Journals or the Journal  Register Parties that is
an Excluded Obligation; subject to the  condition that Purchaser shall have
given      -51-   60     Journal Register and Seller prompt written
notice of, and an  opportunity to defend, any and all such asserted
liabilities; and   (3) in addition to the Taxes for which Sellers have
agreed in  Section 16 to indemnify Purchaser, its affiliates and The Ladue
News,  Inc., any and all liability for income Taxes of any member of the 
consolidated or combined group of corporations in which The Ladue  News, Inc.
has been a member for which The Ladue News, Inc. may be  liable under Section
1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (or any  similar provision of state,
local or foreign law), as a transferee or  successor, by contract or
otherwise.   The indemnification provided for in this Section 19(b)
shall apply only to all Losses, as described in subpart (i) above, of any
amount claimed under this Section 19(b) from and after the point such a
single Loss or an aggregate of such Losses exceeds Two Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($250,000); provided, however, that the indemnification provided for
in this Section 19(b) shall not apply until such Losses exceed Seven Hundred
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000) in the aggregate; and provided further,
that these limitations on the indemnification obligation of Sellers shall not
apply (A) to any amount owed by Sellers to Purchaser in connection with the
Purchase Price Adjustment described in Sections 11 or 14, (B) to any Loss
arising out of or related to any failure of Sellers to discharge the Excluded
Obligations, (C) to any amount owed by Sellers to Purchaser in connection
with any brokers\' fees described in Section 17, (D) to any amount owed by
Sellers to Purchaser in connection with the expense reimbursement described
in Section 22 or (E) any Loss due to fraud. The Journal Register Parties
shall not have liability under this Section 19(b) or otherwise with respect
to the representations and warranties in this Agreement in excess of
$16,500,000 in the aggregate except with respect to any fraudulent or
intentional misrepresentation or breach. No claim for Loss shall be made or
appropriate where such Loss was included as a Current Liability or asset
reserve in determining the Working Capital or Closing Date Working Capital
Amount or if such Loss is covered by insurance except to the extent of any
deductible.   Except with respect to any fraudulent or
intentional misrepresentation or breach, the indemnity agreement in this
Section 19(b) shall be the exclusive liability for breach of the
representations and warranties of the Journal Register Parties set forth in
this Agreement; provided, however, that this limitation shall not foreclose
any rights or remedies of the Purchaser at law or in equity to enforce the
other provisions of this Agreement.   (3) Purchaser and Pulitzer, jointly
and severally, shall indemnify and hold the Journal Register Parties and
their respective affiliates, officers, directors, stockholders, employees,
agents and successors and assigns harmless from and against:   (1) any and
all Losses arising out of or resulting from any  inaccuracy,
misrepresentation or breach of any representation,  warranty, covenant or
agreement of Pulitzer or Purchaser under this  Agreement, provided the
Journal Register Parties shall have given  prompt written notice to Purchaser
of such breach and an opportunity  to defend any claim, demand, action, suit,
proceeding or other  asserted liability; and       -52-   61    
(2) any and all liabilities of the Suburban Journals or of  Purchaser or
Pulitzer, including any and all actions, suits,  proceedings, demands,
assessments, judgments, costs and expenses  (including legal and other
expenses incident thereto), resulting from  the Assumed Obligations or from
causes of action or claims of any kind  asserted by unrelated third parties
arising from actions or omissions  of Purchaser, Pulitzer or any of the
Suburban Journals on or after the  Closing Date; subject to the condition
that the Journal Register  Parties shall have given Purchaser prompt written
notice of, and an  opportunity to defend, any and all such asserted
liabilities.   The indemnification provided for in this Section 19(c)
shall apply to all Losses, as described in subpart (i) above, of any amount
claimed under this Section 19(c) from and after the point such a single Loss
or an aggregate of several such Losses exceeds Two Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($250,000); provided, however, that the indemnification provided for
in this Section 19(c) shall not apply until such Losses exceed Seven Hundred
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000) in the aggregate; and provided further,
that this limitation on the indemnification obligation of Purchaser shall not
apply to (A) any amount owed by Purchaser to Sellers in connection with the
Purchase Price Adjustment described in Sections 11 or 14, (B) any Loss
arising out of or related to any failure of Purchaser to discharge the
Assumed Obligations, (C) any Loss arising out of or related to any failure of
Purchaser to satisfy its obligations under Section 2.4(b), (D) to any amount
owed by Purchaser to Sellers in connection with any brokers\' fees described
in Section 17, and (E) any Loss due to fraudulent or intentional
misrepresentation or breach. Purchaser shall not have liability under this
Section 19(c) or otherwise with respect to the representations and warranties
in this Agreement in excess of $16,500,000 in the aggregate except with
respect to any fraudulent or intentional misrepresentation or breach.  
Except with respect to any fraudulent or intentional misrepresentation or
breach, the indemnity agreement in this Section 19(c) shall be the exclusive
liability for breach of the representations and warranties of Pulitzer or the
Purchaser set forth in this Agreement; provided, however, that this
limitation shall not foreclose any rights or remedies of the Journal Register
Parties at law or in equity to enforce the other provisions of
this Agreement.   (4) Indemnification Procedure.   (1) If at any time a
party entitled to indemnity hereunder (the  "INDEMNITEE") shall receive
notice of any state of facts that may  result in a Loss, the Indemnitee shall
promptly give written notice (a  "NOTICE OF CLAIM") to the party obligated to
provided indemnity  hereunder (the "INDEMNITOR") of the discovery of such
potential or  actual Loss. A Notice of Claim shall set forth (A) a brief
description  of the nature of the potential or actual Loss, and (B) the
total  amount of Loss anticipated (including any costs or expenses which
have  been or may be reasonably incurred in connection therewith). Upon 
receipt of a Notice of Claim, Indemnitor may elect to cure the  occurrence of
the event resulting in the Loss (the "EVENT OF LOSS")  within thirty (30)
days after the date of receipt of the Notice of  Claim, or        
-53-  62   if such cure cannot be effected within such thirty (30) day-
period,  diligently proceed to effect such cure. If such cure cannot be 
effected, payment of the amount of Loss due the Indemnitee as set  forth in a
Notice of Claim shall be made by Indemnitor no later than  the thirtieth
(30th) after the date of the Notice of Claim (or such  later date as the
Indemnitor receives written notice that an actual  Loss has occurred) unless
the provisions of Section 19(d)(ii) or  (d)(iii) are applicable thereto. The
Indemnitee\'s failure to give  prompt notice or to provide copies of
documents or to furnish relevant  data, shall not constitute a defense (in
whole or in part) to any  claim by the Indemnitee against the Indemnitor for
Indemnification,  except and only to the extent that such failure shall have
caused or  increased such liability or adversely affected the ability of
the  Indemnitor to defend against or reduce its liability.   (2) If the
Indemnitor shall reject any Loss as to which a Notice  of Claim is sent by
the Indemnitee, the Indemnitor shall give written  notice of such rejection
to the Indemnitee within thirty (30) days  after the date of receipt of the
Notice of Claim.   (3) If any Notice of Claim relates to any claim made
against an  Indemnitee by a third person, the Notice of Claim shall state
the  nature, basis and amount of such claim. The Indemnitor shall have the 
right, at its election, by written notice to the Indemnitee, to assume  the
defense of the claim as to which such notice has been given.  Except as
provided in the next sentence, if the Indemnitor so elects  to assume such
defense, it shall diligently and in good faith defend  such claim and shall
keep the Indemnitee reasonably informed of the  status of such defense, and
the Indemnitee shall cooperate fully with  the Indemnitor in the defense of
such claim, provided that in the case  of any settlement providing for
remedies other than monetary damages  for which indemnification is provided,
the Indemnitee shall have the  right to approve the settlement, which
approval shall not be  unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Indemnitor
does not so elect  to defend any claim as aforesaid or shall fail to defend
any claim  diligently and in good faith (after having so elected), the
Indemnitee  may assume the defense of such claim and take such other action
as it  may elect to defend or settle such claim as it may determine in its 
reasonable discretion, provided that the Indemnitor shall have the  right to
approve any settlement, which approval will not be  unreasonably withheld or
delayed.   (iv) Pulitzer and Purchaser, upon consummation of the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, release each of the  Journal
Register Parties from any and all Environmental Liabilities  whatsoever which
are in any way, directly or indirectly, related to  ownership or operation of
the SLSJ Assets and may be asserted under  any Environmental Law. This
release shall include, but not be limited  to, any Environmental Remediation
Costs Purchaser or Pulitzer may  incur and any costs Purchaser may incur in
performing any Study or  Phase II Study described at Section 8.4 of this
Agreement. Claims  against the Sellers for any breach of warranty or
indemnification  pursuant to subsections (a) through (d) of this Section 19
shall not  be precluded by this release, but shall, upon consummation of
the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, constitute the sole 
remedy available to either Pulitzer or Purchaser in the event any 
Environmental Liabilities arise which may be asserted      -54-  
63   against the Journal Register Parties, except with respect to claims 
included within the definition of Excluded Obligations.   20. Remedies on
Default. Time is of the essence in the performance of this Agreement. If any
party defaults in the timely performance of its obligations under this
Agreement and fails to consummate this Agreement on the Closing Date and the
other party is not in default, such non-defaulting party shall have all
rights and remedies available to it at law or equity, including specific
performance. The parties agree that because of the unique value and special
nature of the Suburban Journals, failure of either party to carry out its
obligations under this Agreement would cause irreparable injury which could
not be calculated in money damages.   21. Costs and Expenses. Except as
otherwise specifically set forth herein, each of the parties hereto shall
bear all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with this Agreement
and in the preparation for and consummation of the transactions provided for
herein, including the fees and expenses of counsel, accountants and
consultants, whether or not such transactions shall be consummated, and shall
not be entitled to any reimbursement therefor from the other party. All
sales, use and motor vehicle transfer Taxes and real estate transfer Taxes,
including, without limitation, documentary stamp Taxes payable on or with
respect to the documents and instruments of conveyance, if any, in respect of
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be divided and paid equally by the
Journal Register Parties, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand.
All filing fees under the H-S-R Antitrust Act and the cost of any experts
retained jointly by the parties in an effort to obtain regulatory clearance
for the transactions shall be split equally between Purchaser, on one hand,
and the Journal Register Parties, on the other hand.   22. Aged Accounts
Receivable. Purchaser agrees to make commercially reasonable efforts (and no
less favorable than the efforts which are generally exerted by the newspapers
operated by its affiliates) to collect each Aged Accounts Receivable,
including, but not limited to disputed receivables, for a period of 120 days
after the Closing Date. On or before the 20th day of each of the second,
third, fourth and, if necessary, fifth month after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall furnish the Journal Register with (i) a list of, and pay over
to the Journal Register, the amounts collected during the preceding month
with respect to an Aged Accounts Receivable, and (ii) a list of all disputed
amounts and the status of each Aged Accounts Receivable yet to be paid.
Purchaser will be available to meet with Sellers\' representative on
a monthly basis to review Purchaser\'s progress on collection of such Aged
Accounts Receivable and Sellers shall have reasonable access to all related
records during this 120-day period. Any payment received by Purchaser from
any customer whose account includes an Aged Accounts Receivable shall be
first applied in reduction of the Aged Accounts Receivable, unless such
customer either disputes that specific obligation or otherwise specifies that
such payment is made in respect of a specific invoice which is not an Aged
Accounts Receivable. As soon as reasonably possible after the expiration of
the 120-day period, Purchaser shall furnish Journal Register with a list of,
and reassign without recourse to Journal Register, each Aged Accounts
Receivable which is uncollected, together with all files concerning the
collection or attempts to collect the reassigned Aged Accounts Receivable,
and thereafter Purchaser shall have no further responsibility for the
collection of the reassigned Aged    -55-    64   Accounts
Receivable. Purchaser shall not be obligated to refer any Aged
Accounts Receivable to a collection agency or to an attorney for collection,
and Purchaser shall not make any such referrals or compromise, settle or
adjust the amount of any Aged Accounts Receivable without first obtaining
approval of Journal Register; provided, however, that Purchaser (i) shall
evaluate on a regular basis the need for sending an Aged Accounts Receivable
to a collection agency or attorney or compromising an Aged Accounts
Receivable, (ii) will make recommendations on a regular basis to Sellers with
respect to such evaluations, and (iii) if directed by Sellers, Purchaser will
reassign such Aged Accounts Receivable to Sellers at any time prior to the
expiration of the 120-day period in the manner described in the preceding
sentence. Sellers shall be free, however, to take any action it deems
appropriate with respect to any Aged Accounts Receivable reassigned pursuant
hereto.   23. Headings and Entire Agreement. The section and
subsection headings do not constitute any part of this Agreement and are
inserted herein for convenience of reference only. This Agreement, together
with the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, embody the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement may not be
amended, modified or changed orally, but only in writing signed by the party
against whom enforcement of any amendment, modification, change, waiver,
extension or discharge is sought.   24. Waiver. No waiver of a breach of, or
default under, any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of
such provision or of any subsequent breach or default of the same or similar
nature or of any other provision or condition of this Agreement.   25.
Binding Effect and Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties. Neither
this Agreement nor any obligation hereunder shall be assignable except with
the prior written consent of the other party; provided, however, that
Purchaser may assign this Agreement or any of its rights and
obligations hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary or
affiliate of Pulitzer without the prior written consent of the Journal
Register Parties so long as the obligations of such assignee are guaranteed
by Pulitzer pursuant to Section 31(b). Neither party assumes any duty
hereunder to any other person or entity, and this Agreement shall operate
exclusively for the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns
and not for the benefit of any other person or entity. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to vest or create rights in any person or entity not a
party to this Agreement and no such other person or entity shall be deemed a
third party beneficiary hereof.   26. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall
be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of
New York, other than the conflicts of laws principles thereof.   27.
Neutral Construction. The parties to this Agreement agree that this Agreement
was negotiated fairly between them at arms\' length and that the final terms
of this Agreement are the product of the parties\' negotiations. Each party
represents and warrants that it has    -56-     65   sought and
received legal counsel of its own choosing with regard to the contents of
this Agreement and the rights and obligations affected hereby. The parties
agree that this Agreement shall be deemed to have been jointly and equally
drafted by them, and that the provisions of this Agreement therefore should
not be construed against a party or parties on the grounds that the party or
parties drafted or was more responsible for drafting the provisions.   28.
Severability. In the event that any term or provision of this Agreement is
determined to be void, unenforceable or contrary to law, the remainder of
this Agreement shall not be affected and shall remain in full force and
effect, provided that such continuation would not materially diminish
the benefits of or rights under this Agreement for the Journal Register
Parties, on one hand, and Pulitzer and Purchaser, on the other hand.   29.
Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of
which, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed an original, but all
of which taken together shall constitute one agreement.   30. Schedules. The
fact that any disclosure on any Schedule is not required to be disclosed in
order to render the applicable representation or warranty to which it relates
true, or that the absence of such disclosure on any Schedule would not
constitute a breach of such representation or warranty, shall not be deemed
or construed to expand the scope of any representation or warranty hereunder
or to establish a standard of disclosure in respect of any representation or
warranty. In addition, the disclosure of a particular matter on any Schedule
shall not in any circumstance be construed to mean that such matter would be
reasonably likely to have a MAE.   31. Guaranties. (a) Journal Register
hereby guarantees to the Purchaser, as a primary obligor, payment and
performance by each Seller of their respective obligations under this
Agreement and under each of the other agreements contemplated by this
Agreement to which they are parties (including without limitation, all
amendments hereof and thereof), in each case, subject to the terms,
conditions and limitations hereof and thereof. Journal Register hereby waives
suretyship defenses, demand, payment, protest and notice of dishonor or
nonperformance of any such obligations, and no consent of Journal Register
shall be required with respect to any amendment or waiver of this Agreement
(other than this Section 31(a)) that is effected in accordance with this
Agreement. The liability of Journal Register under this Agreement by
reason of this Section 31(a) is primary, and Purchaser shall not be required
to make any demand on the Sellers for performance of any of their obligations
under this Agreement, nor to exhaust any legal, contractual or equitable
remedies against the Sellers, prior to proceeding against Journal
Register   (b) Pulitzer hereby guarantees to the Journal Register
Parties, as a primary obligor, payment and performance by the Purchaser of
its obligations under this Agreement and under each of the other
agreements contemplated by this Agreement to which it is a party (including
without limitation, all amendments hereof and thereof), in each case, subject
to the terms, conditions and limitations hereof and thereof. Pulitzer hereby
waives suretyship defenses, demand, payment, protest and notice of dishonor
or nonperformance of any such obligations, and no consent of Pulitzer shall
be required with respect to any amendment or waiver of this Agreement (other
than this Section 31(b)) that is effected in accordance with this Agreement.
The liability of Pulitzer under this         -57-  66   Agreement
by reason of this Section 31(b) is primary, and no Journal Register Party
shall be required to make any demand on the Purchaser for performance of any
of its obligations under this Agreement, nor to exhaust any
legal, contractual or equitable remedies against the Purchaser, prior to
proceeding against Pulitzer.            -58-   67    IN
WITNESS WHEREOF, each party has caused this Agreement to be duly executed,
sealed and delivered in its name and on its behalf, all as of the date and
year first above written.   PULITZER INC.   By: /s/ Ronald H. Ridgway
