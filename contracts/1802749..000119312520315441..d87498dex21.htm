shall be cancelled ab initio, and such Holder shall not have the power to vote or to transfer the Excess Shares. Upon delivery of a written notice to the Company, any Holder may from time to time increase (with such increase not effective until the
sixty-first (61st) day after delivery of such notice) or decrease the Maximum Percentage of such Holder to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% as specified in such notice; provided that (i)&nbsp;any such increase in the Maximum Percentage
will not be effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to the Company and (ii)&nbsp;any such increase or decrease will apply only to such Holder and the other Attribution Parties and not to any other Holder that is not

any purpose including for purposes of Section&nbsp;13(d) or Rule <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">16a-1(a)(1)</FONT> of the 1934 Act. No prior inability to convert such Notes pursuant to this paragraph shall have any effect on the applicability of
the provisions of this paragraph with respect to any subsequent determination of convertibility. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this
Section&nbsp;14.13 to the extent necessary to correct this paragraph (or any portion of this paragraph) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership limitation contained in this Section&nbsp;14.13 or to make changes
