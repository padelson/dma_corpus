Basis together with all other shares of Company Capital Stock held by the

(d) each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by GigCapital3 and

14

    

 provided, further, that in the case of any Exchanged Option to which Section

Surviving Corporation stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be
determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as
are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the
Code. Except as specifically provided above or as agreed to in writing with
any holder of a Company Option, following the Effective Time, each Exchanged
Option shall continue to be governed by the same vesting and exercisability
terms and otherwise substantially similar terms and conditions as were
applicable to the corresponding former Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time. At or prior to the Effective Time, the parties and their
boards, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that
are necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Company Options pursuant to
this subsection.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i)
the portion of the Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration issuable to any
Person pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)_ shall be calculated on an
aggregate basis with respect to all shares of Company Capital Stock held of
record by such Person immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) after
such aggregation, any fractional share of GigCapital3 Common Stock that would
otherwise be issuable to such Person following such aggregation shall be
rounded up to a whole share of GigCapital3 Common Stock.

SECTION 3.02 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. On the Closing Date, GigCapital3 shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company that shall be designated
by GigCapital3 and is reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange
Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Company Capital Stock, for
exchange in accordance with this _Article III_ , the number of shares of
GigCapital3 Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement (such shares of GigCapital3
Common Stock, the Stockholder Earnout Shares and any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto (pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.02(c)_),
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). GigCapital3 shall
cause the Exchange Agent pursuant to irrevocable instructions, to pay the Per
Share Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this
Agreement. Except as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 3.02(c)_ and _Section_ __
_ 3.07_, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, GigCapital3 shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of Company Capital Stock entitled to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01_:
a letter of transmittal, which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to
GigCapital3 and the Company (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and shall
specify (i) that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates evidencing such shares of Company Capital Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent or confirmation of cancellation of such Certificates from
the Companys transfer agent, eShares, Inc. DBA Carta, Inc. (each, a "
_Transfer Agent Cancellation_ "); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to the Letter of Transmittal.
Within two (2) Business Days (but in no event prior to the Effective Time)
after the surrender to the Exchange Agent of all Certificates held by such
holder for cancellation (or a Transfer Agent Cancellation), together with a
Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto and such other documents as may be reasonably
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificates shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefore, and GigCapital3 shall cause the
Exchange Agent to deliver, the Per Share Closing Merger Consideration in
accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3.01_, and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.02_, each Certificate entitled to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.01(a)_ shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent
only (A) the right to receive upon such surrender the Per Share Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive in accordance with the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)_ and (B) the contingent right to
receive a portion of the Stockholder Earnout Shares, if, as and when payable
in accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3.07_.

 



15

    

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of GigCapital3 Common
Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to the GigCapital3 Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of GigCapital3 Common Stock
represented thereby until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.02(b)_. Subject to the effect
of escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, GigCapital3 shall pay or cause to be paid to the holder of the
certificates representing shares of GigCapital3 Common Stock issued in
exchange therefore, without interest, (i) promptly, but in any event within
five (5) Business Days of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid
with respect to such shares of GigCapital3 Common Stock, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment
date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such shares of
GigCapital3 Common Stock.

(d) _No Further Rights in Company Capital Stock_. The Per Share
Merger Consideration and the Stockholder Earnout Shares payable upon
conversion of the Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof
shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Company Capital Stock.

(e) _Adjustments to Per Share Consideration_. The Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to GigCapital3 Common Stock occurring on or after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _
3.07_ hereto, any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to
the holders of Company Capital Stock for one year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to GigCapital3, upon demand, and any holders of Company
Capital Stock who have not theretofore complied with this _Section_ __ _
3.02_ shall thereafter look only to GigCapital3 for the Per Share Merger
Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed
by holders of Company Capital Stock as of a date which is immediately prior
to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any government entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become
the property of GigCapital3 free and clear of any claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

(g) _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, GigCapital3 or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Company Capital Stock for any
such Company Capital Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.02_.

 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and GigCapital3
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to Person such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") or
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority
by the Surviving Corporation or GigCapital3, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Surviving Corporation or GigCapital3, as the case may be. The
Surviving Corporation, GigCapital3 and any holder of Company Capital Stock,
as applicable, shall reasonably cooperate to reduce or seek an exemption from
any withholding, including by timely providing IRS Form W-9. 

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Per
Share Merger

 Consideration that such holder is otherwise entitled to receive pursuant to,
and in accordance with, the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)_.

 

SECTION 3.03 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Company Capital Stock thereafter on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
representing Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Capital Stock, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by
Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the
Exchange Agent or GigCapital3 for any reason shall be converted into (a) the
Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with the provisions of _Section_
__ _ 3.01(a)_ and (b) the contingent right to receive a portion of the
Stockholder Earnout Shares if, as and when payable in accordance with the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3.07_.

in writing appraisal for such Company Capital Stock in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL and otherwise complied with all of the provisions of the DGCL

Consideration or the contingent right to receive any portion of the
Stockholder Earnout Shares, unless and until such stockholder fails to

payment under the DGCL. Any stockholder of the Company who fails to perfect or
who 

 



17

    

 effectively withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its rights to appraisal
of such shares of Company Capital Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become

Agreement by the Company will not (i) conflict with or violate the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws or any equivalent organizational documents of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) conflict with or violate any
statute, law, ordinance, regulation, rule, code, executive order, injunction,

affected, or (iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default)
under, or give to others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien (other than any Permitted
Lien) on any material property or asset of the Company or any Company

to, any United States federal, state, county or local or non-United States
government, governmental or quasi-governmental, regulatory or administrative
authority or office, any political or other subdivision thereof, agency,
instrumentality, bureau, authority, body or commission or any court, tribunal,
or judicial or arbitral body (a " _Governmental Authority_ "), except (i) for

"blue sky" laws (" _Blue Sky Laws_ ") and state takeover laws, the pre-merger
notification requirements of the HSR Act, and filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL, and (ii) where the

for each of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate
its properties or to carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the
" _Company Permits_ "), except where the failure to have such Company Permits
does not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or
cancellation of any of the Company Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened in writing. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is in conflict with, or in default, breach or violation of, (a) any
Law applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any
property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or
affected, or (b) any Material Contract or Company Permit, except, in each

limitation, ERISA and the Code. The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have
performed, in all material respects, all obligations required to be performed
by them under, are not in any material respect in default under or in
violation of, and have no knowledge of any default or violation in any
material respect by any party to, any Plan that has resulted or is reasonably

Subsidiary. No Action is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,

exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code or (ii)
with respect to a preapproved plan, is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion
or advisory letter from the IRS with respect to the underlying preapproved
plan, and to the knowledge of Company, no fact or event has occurred since the
date of such determination, opinion or advisory letter or letters from the IRS
that would reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of
the qualified status of any such Plan or the exempt status of any such trust
by the IRS.

 



26

    

(h) To the knowledge of the Company, there has not been any non-exempt
prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code) that is reasonably likely to result in material liability of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary. There have been no acts or omissions
by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates that have given or would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material fines, penalties, taxes or
related charges on the Company or any Company Subsidiary under Sections 502
or 4071 of ERISA or Chapter 43 of the Code.

(i) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect
to any Plan have been timely made to the extent due or properly accrued on the
consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
except as would not result in material liability to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
maintains, administers or has any liability (contingent or otherwise) with
respect to a defined benefit plan that is subject to Section 412 of the Code
or Title IV of ERISA. Each Plan required to be funded by applicable Law or
the terms of such Plan has been, is and will be materially funded as of the

Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code.

 

(k) The Company and each Plan that is a "group health plan" as defined in
Section 733(a)(1) of ERISA (each, a " _Health Plan_ ") is and has been in
compliance, in all material respects, with the applicable provisions of the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended (" _PPACA_ "),
and no event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, that
would reasonably be expected to subject the Company, any ERISA Affiliate or
any Health Plan to any material liability for penalties or excise taxes under
Code Section 4980D or 4980H or any other provision of the PPACA.

(l) Each Plan that constitutes a nonqualified deferred compensation plan
subject to Section 409A of the Code has been documented, administered and
operated, in all material respects, in good faith compliance with the
provisions of Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder, and no additional Tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code has
been or would reasonably be expected to be incurred by a participant in any
such Plan.

(a) GigCapital3 has filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents, including any exhibits thereto, required to be filed by it with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since May 13, 2020,
together with any amendments, restatements or supplements thereto
(collectively, the " _GigCapital3 SEC Reports_ "). GigCapital3 has heretofore
furnished to the Company true and correct copies of all amendments and
modifications that have not been filed by GigCapital3 with the SEC to all
agreements, documents and other instruments that previously had been filed by
GigCapital3 with the SEC and are currently in effect. As of their respective

the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "), the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time
they were filed, or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Each director and executive officer of GigCapital3 has filed
with the SEC on a timely basis all documents required with respect to
GigCapital3 by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

 

(b) Each of the financial statements (including, in each case, any notes
thereto) contained in the GigCapital3 SEC Reports was prepared in accordance
with GAAP (applied on a consistent basis) and Regulation S-X and Regulation
S-K, as applicable, throughout the periods indicated (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited financial
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and each fairly presents, in
all material respects, the financial position, results of operations, changes
in stockholders equity and cash flows of GigCapital3 as at the respective
dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein, (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments
which have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to individually or in
the aggregate be material). GigCapital3 has no off-balance sheet arrangements
that are not disclosed in the GigCapital3 SEC Reports. No financial statements
other than those of GigCapital3 are required by GAAP to be included in the
consolidated financial statements of GigCapital3.

 

(c) Except as and to the extent set forth in the GigCapital3 SEC Reports,
neither GigCapital3 nor Merger Sub has any liability or obligation of a
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required to be
reflected on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for

GigCapital3s and Merger Subs business.

(d) GigCapital3 is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the New York Stock

controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to GigCapital3 and other material information required to be
disclosed by GigCapital3 in the reports and other documents that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
GigCapital3s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting GigCapital3s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer to material information required to be included in
GigCapital3s periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

 

(f) GigCapital3 maintains systems of internal control over financial reporting
that are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance: (i) that GigCapital3 maintains
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect, in all
material respects, its transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) that
transactions are

 



41

    

 recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP; (iii) that receipts and expenditures are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management and its board of directors;
and (iv) regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of its assets that could have a material effect on its
financial statements. GigCapital3 has delivered to the Company a true and
complete copy of any disclosure (or, if unwritten, a summary thereof) by any
representative of GigCapital3 to GigCapital3s independent auditors relating
to any material weaknesses in internal controls and any
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls that
would adversely affect the ability of GigCapital3 to record, process,
summarize and report financial data. GigCapital3 has no knowledge of any fraud
or whistle-blower allegations, whether or not material, that involve
management or other employees or consultants who have or had a significant
role in the internal control over financial reporting of GigCapital3. Since
May 13, 2020, there have been no material changes in GigCapital3 internal
control over financial reporting.

(g) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by
GigCapital3 to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the
Exchange Act) or director of GigCapital3. GigCapital3 has not taken any action
prohibited by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(h) Neither GigCapital3 (including any employee thereof) nor GigCapital3s
independent auditors has identified or been made aware of (i) any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls
utilized by GigCapital3, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves GigCapital3s management or other employees who have a role in the
preparation of financial statements or the internal accounting controls
utilized by GigCapital3 or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding any of the
foregoing.

 

(i) As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding SEC comments from the SEC
with respect to the GigCapital3 SEC Reports. To the knowledge of GigCapital3,
none of the GigCapital3 SEC Reports filed on or prior to the date hereof is
subject to ongoing SEC review or investigation as of the date hereof.

conducted its business in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with
past practice, and (b) there has not been any GigCapital3 Material Adverse
Effect.

 

SECTION 5.09 _Absence of Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the
knowledge of GigCapital3, threatened against GigCapital3, or any property or
asset of GigCapital3, before any Governmental Authority. Neither GigCapital3

by, any Governmental Authority.

with the giving of notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a
breach or default by GigCapital3 or the Trustee. There are no separate
contracts, agreements, side letters or other understandings (whether written
or unwritten, express or implied): (i) between GigCapital3 and the Trustee
that would cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the GigCapital3
SEC Reports to be inaccurate in any material respect; or (ii) to the knowledge
of GigCapital3, that would entitle any person (other than stockholders of
GigCapital3 who shall have elected to redeem their shares of GigCapital3
Common Stock pursuant to the GigCapital3 Organizational Documents) to any
portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of
the funds held in the Trust Account may be released except: (A) to pay income
and franchise taxes from any interest income earned in the Trust Account; and
(B) upon the exercise of Redemption Rights in accordance with the provisions
of the GigCapital3 Organizational Documents. As of the date hereof, there are
no Actions pending or, to the knowledge of GigCapital3, threatened in writing
with respect to the Trust Account. Upon consummation of the Merger and notice
thereof to the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement, GigCapital3 shall
cause the Trustee to, and the Trustee shall thereupon be obligated to, release
to GigCapital3 as promptly as practicable, the Trust Funds in accordance with
the Trust Agreement at which point the Trust Account shall terminate; 
_provided_ , _however_ that the liabilities and obligations of GigCapital3 due
and owing or incurred at or prior to the Effective Time shall be paid as and
when due, including all amounts payable (a) to stockholders of GigCapital3
who shall have exercised their Redemption Rights, (b) with respect to
filings, applications and/or other actions taken pursuant to this Agreement
required under Law, (c) to the Trustee for fees and costs incurred in
accordance with the Trust Agreement; and (d) to third parties (e.g.,
professionals, printers, etc.) who have rendered services to GigCapital3 in
connection with its efforts to effect the Merger (including deferred fees owed
by GigCapital3 to Nomura and Oppenheimer, pursuant to that certain
Underwriting Agreement, dated May 13, 2020, among Nomura, Oppenheimer and
GigCapital3). As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company herein and the compliance by
the Company with its respective obligations hereunder, GigCapital3 has no
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the use of funds in the Trust
Account will not be satisfied or funds available in the Trust Account will not
be available to GigCapital3 at the Effective Time.

GigCapital3 nor the consummation of the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (either alone or in combination with another event) will (i) result
in the payment of severance or any other amount to any employee, director,

persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such persons).

 

SECTION 10.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without
regard to any conflict of law rule or principle that would result in the
application of any laws other than the laws of the State of New York;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any matter of corporate law that would be

unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a

to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that
it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in New York as
described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (c) that (i) the Action in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Action is improper or (iii)
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by
such courts.

SECTION 10.07 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have
to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or
the Transactions. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that
it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the
Transactions, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this  _Section_ __ _ 10.07_.

(including by facsimile or portable document format (pdf) transmission) in one
or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

obtaining equitable relief.

LIGHTNING SYSTEMS, INC.

 

STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT

 

OCTOBER 23, 2020

 



1

    

LIGHTNING SYSTEMS, INC.

 

STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT

 

THIS STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_ ") is made as of the 23rd day
of October, 2020, by and among Lightning Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ "), and the persons listed as Major Investors on _Exhibit_ __
_ A_ attached hereto (each of which is referred to in this Agreement as a "
_Major Investor_ " and collectively as the " _Major Investors_ "). Capitalized
terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in
the Certificate.

RECITALS

 

A. The Company and the Major Investors have reviewed that certain letter of
intent, dated September 21, 2020, by and between the Company and GigCapital3,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _GigCapital3_ "), which is attached hereto as
_Exhibit B_ (the " _Term Sheet_ "), pursuant to which the Company intends to
combine with GigCapital3 upon the terms and conditions provided therein, as
amended, revised and approved by the Companys Board of Directors and
stockholders (the " _Transaction_ ").

 

B. The Company and the Major Investors agree that, pursuant to the Companys
Certificate of Incorporation dated December 31, 2019, as amended prior to the
date of this Agreement (as amended, the " _Certificate_ "), the Transaction
shall not be treated as a Deemed Liquidation Event, nor does it constitute a
Qualified Public Offering. The Company and the Major Investors, however,
agree that upon consummation of the Transaction the intent of the parties is
to provide rights and benefits to the Major Investors that are tantamount to a
Qualified Public Offering in all material respects, all as expressly
set forth in this Agreement.

C. Pursuant to the Certificate, all of the outstanding shares of the Companys
Preferred Stock shall be mandatorily converted into shares of the Companys
Common Stock (a " _Mandatory Conversion_ _")_ __ upon (i) the vote or written
consent of the holders of at least 70% of the outstanding Series B Preferred
Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an
as-converted to Common Stock basis (the " _Requisite Holders_ "), or (ii) the
occurrence of a Qualified Public Offering.

D. The undersigned Major Investors (as defined in that certain Amended and
Restated Investor Rights Agreement, dated as of May 18, 2020, by and between
the Company and the parties thereto, (the " _Investor Rights Agreement_ "))
hold at least (i) [97%] of the Companys Series B Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock, collectively as a single class on an as-converted to Common
Stock basis, and (ii) [75%] of the Companys capital stock, collectively as a
single class, on a fully diluted basis (inclusive of Company warrants to
purchase equity securities of the Company (collectively the " _Warrants_ ") as
well as outstanding convertible notes issued by the Company).

 

E. The Major Investors constitute the "Requisite Holders" and therefore are
entitled to force a Mandatory Conversion based on the conversion ratio as set
forth in the Certificate, plus any declared but unpaid dividends.

F. In order to induce GigCapital3 to enter into the Transaction, the Major
Investors and the Company hereby agree that this Agreement shall govern the
rights and obligations of the Major Investors and the Company regarding the
matters set forth herein.

 

G. In order to further induce GigCapital3 to enter into the Transaction, the
parties desire that, upon the consummation of the Transaction, that certain
Voting Agreement, dated as of December 31, 2019, by and between the Company
and the parties thereto (the " _Voting Agreement_ ") and that certain Co-Sale
Agreement, dated as of December 31, 2019, by and between the Company and the
parties thereto (the " _Co-Sale Agreement_") shall be terminated and of no
further force or effect, subject to the survival of those rights and
obligations that, by their terms, survive termination.

AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1\. Mandatory Conversion. Provided that (i) the Companys stockholders have
approved the Transaction and its terms as required by the Certificate and the
Investor Rights Agreement, (ii) the aggregate value of the shares of
GigCapital3 common stock to be received by the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to the Transaction is at least $500,000,000 and (iii) all conditions
to the consummation of the Transaction as set forth in the business
combination agreement to be entered into between the Company and GigCapital 3
(the " _Business Combination Agreement_ ") __ have been satisfied or waived
by the other party affected (clauses (i)  (iii), collectively, the "
_Conditions_ "), each Major Investor hereby agrees and consents to the
conversion of all outstanding shares of the Companys Preferred Stock into
shares of the Companys Common Stock, pursuant to Section 5.1(b) of the
Certificate, at the then effective conversion rate as calculated pursuant to
Section 4.1.1 of the Certificate (the " _Conversion_ ") immediately prior to
consummation of the Transaction. For clarity, to the extent the Transaction is
not consummated, the Conversion as contemplated by this Agreement will not
occur.

 

2\. Dividends. Provided that all of the Conditions have been satisfied, the
Major Investors hereby agree that all accrued and unpaid dividends on
the Preferred Stock at the time of Conversion shall be paid, immediately
prior to the conversion of the Companys Common Stock into shares of common
stock of GigCapital 3 as contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement,
in shares of the Companys Common Stock based on the PIK Conversion Shares
(as defined below) for each holder. For purposes of this Section 2, the PIK
Conversion Shares for each holder of Preferred Stock shall be calculated as
follows:

 

PIK Conversion Shares = Dividend Value divided by the Exchange Ratio



      |  |  |

Dividend Value = the aggregate dollar value of all accrued and unpaid
dividends on all shares of Preferred Stock held by a such holder at the time
of conversion 

---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  |

Exchange Ratio = (i) the Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration Value (as
defined in the Business Combination Agreement) divided by (ii) the total
number of shares of Common Stock of the Company (calculated on a fully-diluted
basis assuming the conversion of all outstanding securities of the Company
that are convertible into shares of Common Stock).  

---|---|---|--- 

3\. Warrants.

 

(a) The Company and each Major Investor agree to the following amendments to
the Companys outstanding Warrants ((i) and (ii) below, together, the "
_Warrant Amendments_ "):

(1) The termination, expiration and exercise period for all outstanding
Warrants shall be the time immediately prior to the consummation of the
Transaction, and in no event shall any Warrants be exercisable following the
consummation of the Transaction; and

 

(2) In the event that the Transaction has not been consummated by December 31,
2020 (despite all of the Conditions to the Transaction having been satisfied
or waived by the Company), the termination date, expiration date and exercise
period of the Warrants currently scheduled to expire on December 31, 2020 (the
"Short Term Warrants") are hereby amended to be the earlier of (1) the time
set forth in clause (i) above and (2) March 31, 2021.

(b) The parties further agree that any action by the Company, its Board of
Directors or agents, any Major Investor or any third party in preparation for
or anticipation of the Transaction (including actions taken pursuant to this
Agreement) shall be exempt from the provisions of Section 7 of the Warrants
relating to early termination of the Warrants upon the occurrence of certain
events, and from any other provisions of any Warrant that would have a similar
effect on one or more of the Warrants, and none of such actions singly or
together shall be deemed to cause any early termination of one or more
Warrants or to have a

 



3

    

 comparable result. Each Major Investor agrees either to (1) exercise in full
all outstanding Warrants held by such Major Investor on a net basis or
standard cash basis, at the Warrant holders discretion, immediately prior to
the consummation of the Transaction or (2) provide five days written notice
to the Company of its determination not to exercise its Warrants, or a
combination of (1) and (2) if the Warrant holder so chooses, in which case
any such unexercised Warrants shall terminate and expire immediately prior to
the Transaction.

4\. Termination of Other Agreements. Provided that all the Conditions have
been satisfied, the Company and each of the undersigned Major Investors hereby
agree that, contemporaneously with the consummation of the Transaction, each
of the Investor Rights Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the Co-Sale
Agreement shall be terminated and have no further force or effect, subject to
the survival of those rights and obligations (a) that have accrued under
such contracts prior to the date the Transaction is consummated or (b) that,
by their terms, survive termination.

5\. Confidentiality. Each Major Investor agrees that such Major Investor will
keep confidential and will not disclose, divulge, or use for any purpose
(other than to monitor its investment in the Company) any confidential
information obtained from the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
unless such confidential information is known or becomes known to the public
in general; provided, however, that a Major Investor may disclose confidential
information to its attorneys, accountants, consultants, and
other professionals to the extent necessary to obtain their services in
connection with monitoring its investment in the Company and the Transaction,
or as may otherwise be required by law, regulations or government rules,
including those adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission and
applicable state securities authorities, provided that the Major Investor
promptly notifies the Company of such disclosure and takes reasonable steps to
minimize the extent of any such required disclosure.

 

6\. Reservation of Common Stock. The Company will at all times reserve and
keep available for issuance such number of shares of Common Stock sufficient
to effect the Mandatory Conversion and to permit the full exercise of the
Warrants and the conversion of the Companys outstanding convertible
promissory notes and other convertible securities, and to permit the
subsequent conversion of Company securities issued upon such exercise and
conversion into shares of the Companys Common Stock.

7\. Covenants. Subject to all the Conditions being satisfied, each Major
Investor agrees:

(a) to vote or cause to be voted (in person, by proxy or by action by written
consent or in any other manner permitted by applicable law, as applicable) all
shares of Company stock owned by such Major Investor, or over which such Major
Investor has voting control, from time to time and at all times to effectuate

or after the Effective Time, the Holders holding at least a majority in
interest of the then-outstanding number of Registrable Securities held by all
the Holders (such Holders, the "Demanding Holders"), may make a written
demand for Registration under the Securities Act of all or part of their
Registrable Securities, which written demand shall describe the amount and
type of securities to be included in such Registration and the intended
method(s) of distribution thereof (such written demand a "Demand

Registration, a "Requesting Holder") shall so notify the Company, in writing,
within five (5) days after the receipt by the Holder of the notice from the
Company. Upon receipt by the Company of any such written notification from a
Requesting Holder(s) to the Company, such Requesting Holder(s) shall be
entitled to have their Registrable Securities included in a Registration
pursuant to a Demand Registration and the Company shall effect, as soon
thereafter as practicable, but not more than forty five (45) days immediately
after the Companys receipt of the Demand Registration, the Registration of
all Registrable Securities requested by the Demanding Holders and Requesting
Holders pursuant to such Demand Registration. Under no circumstances shall the
Company be obligated to effect more than an aggregate of three (3)
Registrations pursuant to a Demand Registration under this _Section_ __ _
2.1.1_ initiated by Holders; _provided_ , that a Registration shall not be
counted for such purposes unless a Form S-1 or any similar long-form
registration statement that may be available at such time ("Form S-1") has

Requesting Holders to be registered on behalf of the Requesting Holders in
such Form S-1 Registration have been sold, in accordance with _Section_ __ _

(i) a Form S-1 filed with the Commission in connection with the Registration
has been declared effective by the Commission and (ii) the Company has
complied with all of its obligations under this Agreement with respect
thereto; _provided_ , that if, after such Registration Statement has been
declared effective, the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a
Demand Registration is interfered with by any stop order or injunction of the
Commission or any other governmental agency or court, the Registration
Statement with respect to such Demand Registration will be deemed not to have
been declared effective, unless and until, (i) such stop order or injunction

interest of the Demanding Holders initiating such Demand Registration

be received by the Company not later than five (5) days after the removal of
any such stop order or injunction; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company

that the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant thereto shall be in the
form of an Underwritten Offering, then the right of such Demanding Holder or
Requesting Holder (if any) to include its Registrable Securities in such
Registration shall be conditioned upon such Holders participation in such
Underwritten Offering and the inclusion of such Holders Registrable
Securities in such Underwritten Offering to the extent provided herein. All
such Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through an
Underwritten Offering under this _Section_ __ _ 2.1.3_ shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for
such Underwritten Offering by a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders

2.1.4 _Reduction of Underwritten Offering_. If the managing Underwriter(s) for
a Demand Registration that is to be an Underwritten Offering, in good faith,
advises the Company, the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders in
writing that the dollar amount or number of Registrable Securities which the
Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) desire to sell, taken
together with all other shares of Common Stock or other equity securities
which the Company desires to sell and the shares of Common Stock, if any, as
to which a Registration has been requested pursuant to separate written
contractual piggy-back registration rights held by other stockholders of the
Company who desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum
number of equity securities that can be sold in the Underwritten Offering
without adversely affecting the proposed offering price, the timing, the
distribution method, or the probability of success of such Underwritten
Offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of securities, as

persons and that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of

Demanding Holders initiating a Demand Registration pursuant to a Registration

whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the Underwriter(s) (if
any) of their intention to withdraw from such Registration prior to
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement filed with the Commission
with respect to the Registration of their Registrable Securities pursuant to
such Demand Registration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 

 



5

    

 Agreement, if with respect to a Demand Registration, a majority-in-interest
of the Demanding Holders initiating a Demand Registration so withdraw from a
Registration pursuant to such Demand Registration, such Registration shall not
count as a Demand Registration provided for in _Section_ __ _ 2.1.1_ and the
Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in
connection with a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration prior to its
withdrawal under this _Section_ __ _ 2.1.5_.

or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer or offering of securities

such proposed filing to all of the Holders of Registrable Securities as soon
as practicable but in no event less than ten (10) days before the anticipated

other than the Holders of Registrable Securities, then the Company shall
include in any such Registration (A) first, the Common Stock or other equity
securities, if any, of such requesting persons or entities, other than the
Holders of Registrable Securities, which can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause (A), the

Maximum Number of Securities; (C) third, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and

exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

 

2.2.3 _Piggyback Registration Withdrawal_. Any Holder of Registrable
Securities shall have the right to withdraw from a Piggyback Registration for
any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the
Underwriter(s) of his, her or its intention to withdraw from such Piggyback
Registration prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement
filed with the Commission with respect to such Piggyback Registration. The
Company (whether on its own good faith determination or as the result of a
request for withdrawal by persons pursuant to separate written contractual
obligations) may withdraw a Registration Statement filed with the Commission
in connection with a Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the
effectiveness of such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the
Registration Expenses incurred in connection with the Piggyback Registration
prior to its withdrawal under this _subsection_ __ _ 2.2.3. _

 

2.2.4 _Unlimited Piggyback Registration Rights_. For purposes of clarity, any
Registration effected pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ hereof shall not be
counted as a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration effected under
_Section_ __ _ 2.1_ hereof.

 

Section 2.3 Registration on Form S-3. The Holders of Registrable
Securities may at any time, and from time to time, request in writing that
the Company, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor
rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission), register the resale of any or
all of their Registrable Securities on Form S-3 or any similar short-form
registration statement that may be available at such time ("Form S-3");
_provided_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to effect such request
through an Underwritten Offering. Within five (5) days of the Companys
receipt of a written request from a Holder or Holders of Registrable
Securities for a Registration on Form S-3, the Company shall promptly give
written notice of the proposed Registration on Form S-3 to all other Holders
of Registrable Securities, and each Holder of Registrable Securities who
thereafter wishes to include all or a portion of such Holders Registrable
Securities in such Registration on Form S-3 shall so notify the Company, in
writing, within ten (10) days after the receipt by the Holder of the notice
from the Company. As soon as practicable thereafter, but not more than twelve
(12) days after the Companys initial receipt of such written request for a
Registration on Form S-3, the Company shall register all or such portion of
such Holders Registrable Securities as are specified in such written request,
together with all or such portion of Registrable Securities of any
other Holder or Holders joining in such request as are specified in the
written notification given by such Holder or Holders; _provided_ , that the
Company shall not

 



7

    

 be obligated to effect any such Registration pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.3_ hereof if (i) a Form S-3 is not available for such offering; or (ii) the
Holders of Registrable Securities, together with the Holders of any other
equity securities of the Company entitled to inclusion in such Registration,
propose to sell the Registrable Securities and such other equity securities
(if any) at any aggregate price to the public of less than $5,000,000.
Registrations effected pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ shall not be
counted as Demand Registrations effected pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1_.

Section 2.4 Restrictions on Registration Rights. If (A) during the period
starting with the date sixty (60) days prior to the Companys good faith
estimate of the date of the filing of, and ending on a date one hundred and
twenty (120) days after the effective date of, a Company
initiated Registration and provided that the Company has delivered written
notice to the Holders prior to receipt of a Demand Registration pursuant to
_subsection 2.1.1_ and it continues to actively employ, in good faith, all
reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Registration Statement to become
effective; (B) the Holders have requested an Underwritten Registration and the
Company and the Holders are unable to obtain the commitment of underwriters to
firmly underwrite the offer; or (C) in the good faith judgment of the Board
such Registration would be seriously detrimental to the Company and the Board
concludes as a result that it is essential to defer the filing of such
Registration Statement at such time, then in each case the Company shall
furnish to such Holders a certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board
stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board it would be seriously
detrimental to the Company for such Registration Statement to be filed in
the near future and that it is therefore essential to defer the filing of
such Registration Statement. In such event, the Company shall have the right
to defer such filing for a period of not more than thirty (30) days;
_provided_ , that the Company may not defer its obligation in this manner
more than once in any 12-month period.

 

ARTICLE III

 

REGISTRATION PROCEDURES

 

Section 3.1 General Procedures. If at any time on or after the Effective Time
the Company is required to effect the registration of any Registrable
Securities pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2_, the Company shall use its best
efforts to effect the Registration to permit the sale of such Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended plan of distribution thereof, and
pursuant thereto the Company shall, as expeditiously as practicable and in
connection with any such request:

 

3.1.1 prepare and file with the Commission as soon as practicable a
Registration Statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to
become effective and remain effective until all Registrable Securities covered
by such Registration Statement have been sold;

 

3.1.2 prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and post-effective
amendments to the Registration Statement, and such supplements to the
Prospectus, as may be reasonably requested by the Holders or any Underwriter
of Registrable Securities or as may be required by the rules, regulations or
instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company or by the
Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder to keep the Registration
Statement effective until all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement are sold in accordance with the intended plan of
distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or supplement to the
Prospectus;

3.1.3 prior to filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment
or supplement thereto, furnish without charge to the Underwriters, if any,
and the Holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration, and
such Holders legal counsel, copies of such Registration Statement as proposed
to be filed, each amendment and supplement to such Registration Statement (in
each case including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by
reference therein), the Prospectus included in such Registration Statement
(including each preliminary Prospectus), and such other documents as the
Underwriters and the Holders of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration or the legal counsel for any such Holders may request in order to
facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such
Holders;

 



8

    

3.1.4 prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use its best
efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement under such securities or "blue sky" laws of such
jurisdictions in the United States as the Holders of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement (in light of their intended plan of
distribution) may request and (ii) take such action necessary to cause such
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be registered
with or approved by such other governmental authorities as may be necessary
by virtue of the business and operations of the Company and do any and all
other acts and things that may be necessary or advisable to enable the Holders
of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement to
consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities in such
jurisdictions; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be required to qualify
generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be
required to qualify or take any action to which it would be subject to general
service of process or taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then
otherwise so subject;

 

3.1.5 cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed on each securities
exchange or automated quotation system on which similar securities issued by
the Company are then listed;

3.1.6 provide a transfer agent or warrant agent, as applicable, and registrar
for all such Registrable Securities no later than the effective date of such
Registration Statement;

3.1.7 advise each seller of such Registrable Securities, promptly after it
shall receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance of any stop
order by the Commission suspending the effectiveness of such Registration
Statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose
and promptly use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any
stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order should be issued;

 

3.1.8 advise each Holder of Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement, promptly after the Company receives notice
thereof, of the time when such registration statement has been declared
effective or a supplement to any Prospectus forming a part of such
registration statement has been filed;

 

3.1.9 at least five (5) days prior to the filing of any Registration Statement
or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement
or Prospectus or any document that is to be incorporated by reference into
such Registration Statement or Prospectus, furnish a copy thereof to each
seller of such Registrable Securities or its counsel, including,
without limitation, providing copies promptly upon receipt of any comment
letters received with respect to any such Registration Statement or
Prospectus;

 

3.1.10 notify the Holders at any time when a Prospectus relating to such
Registration Statement is required to be delivered under the Securities Act,
of the happening of any event as a result of which the Prospectus included in
such Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes a Misstatement, and
then to correct such Misstatement as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 3.4_
hereof;

3.1.11 permit a representative of the Holders (such representative to be
selected by a majority of the participating Holders), the Underwriters, if
any, and any attorney or accountant retained by such Holders or Underwriter to
participate, at each such persons own expense, in the preparation of the
Registration Statement, and cause the Companys officers, directors and
employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such
representative, Underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with the
Registration; _provided_ , that such representatives or Underwriters enter
into a confidentiality agreement, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, prior to the release or disclosure of any such
information;

 

3.1.12 obtain a "comfort" letter from the Companys independent registered
public accountants in the event of an Underwritten Registration, in customary
form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by "comfort"
letters as the managing Underwriter may reasonably request, and may be found
reasonably satisfactory to a majority-in-interest of the participating
Holders;

3.1.13 on the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for sale pursuant
to such Registration, obtain an opinion and negative assurance letter, dated
such date, of counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such
Registration, addressed to the Holders, the placement agent or sales agent,
if any, and the Underwriters, if any, covering such legal matters with respect
to the Registration in respect of which such opinion is being given

 



9

    

 as the Holders, placement agent, sales agent, or Underwriter may reasonably
request and as are customarily included in such opinions and negative
assurance letters, and may be found reasonably satisfactory to a majority in
interest of the participating Holders;

3.1.14 in the event of any Underwritten Offering, enter into and perform its
obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with
the managing Underwriters of such offering;

 

3.1.15 make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably
practicable, an earnings statement covering the period of at least
twelve (12) months beginning with the first day of the Companys first full
calendar quarter after the effective date of the Registration Statement which
satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule
158 thereunder (or any successor rule promulgated thereafter by the
Commission);

3.1.16 if the Registration involves the Registration of Registrable
Securities involving gross proceeds in excess of $25,000,000, use its
reasonable efforts to make available senior executives of the Company to
participate in customary "road show" presentations that may be reasonably
requested by the Underwriter in any Underwritten Offering; and

3.1.17 otherwise, in good faith, cooperate reasonably with, and take such
customary actions as may reasonably be requested by the Holders, in
connection with such Registration.

Section 3.2 Registration Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
Registration Expenses of all Registrations shall be borne by the Company. It
is acknowledged by the Holders that the Holders shall bear all incremental
selling expenses relating to the sale of Registrable Securities, such as
Underwriters commissions and discounts, brokerage fees, Underwriter marketing
costs and, other than as set forth in the definition of "Registration
Expenses," all reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel representing
the Holders.

Section 3.3 Requirements for Participation in Underwritten Offerings. No
person or entity may participate in any Underwritten Offering for equity
securities of the Company pursuant to a Registration initiated by the Company
hereunder unless such person or entity (i) agrees to sell such persons or
entitys securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements
approved by the Company and (ii) completes and executes all customary
questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, lock-up agreements,
underwriting agreements and other customary documents as may be reasonably
required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

 

Section 3.4 Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure. Upon receipt of written
notice from the Company that a Registration Statement or Prospectus contains
a Misstatement, each of the Holders shall forthwith discontinue disposition of
Registrable Securities until such Holder has received copies of a supplemented
or amended Prospectus correcting the Misstatement (it being understood that
the Company hereby covenants to prepare and file such supplemented or amended
Prospectus as soon as practicable after the time of such notice), or until he,
she or it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus
may be resumed. If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of a
Registration Statement in respect of any Registration at any time would
require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure or would require
the inclusion in such Registration Statement of financial statements that are
unavailable to the Company for reasons beyond the Companys control, the
Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such action to the Holders,
delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such
Registration Statement for the shortest period of time, but in no event more
than thirty (30) days, determined in good faith by the Company to be necessary
for such purpose. In the event the Company exercises its rights under the
preceding sentence, the Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon their
receipt of the notice referred to above, their use of the Prospectus relating
to any Registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable
Securities. The Company shall immediately notify the Holders of the expiration
of any period during which it exercised its rights under this _Section_ __ _
3.4_, and upon the expiration of such period the Holders shall be entitled to
resume the use of any such Prospectus in connection with any sale or offer to
sell Registrable Securities, and upon the expiration of such period the

 



10

    

 Holders shall be entitled to resume the use of any such Prospectus in
connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable Securities

 

Section 3.5 Reporting Obligations. As long as any Holder shall own Registrable
Securities, the Company, at all times while it shall be reporting under the
Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain extensions in respect
thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to
be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to _Sections_ __ _
13(a)_ or _15(d)_ of the Exchange Act and to promptly furnish the Holders
with true and complete copies of all such filings. The Company further
covenants that it shall take such further action as any Holder may reasonably
request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to
sell Registrable Securities held by such Holder without registration under the
Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act (or any successor rule promulgated
thereafter by the Commission), including providing any legal opinions. Upon
the request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written
certification of a duly authorized officer as to whether it has complied with
such requirements.

ARTICLE IV

 

INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

 

Section 4.1 Indemnification by the Company. The Company agrees to indemnify,
to the extent permitted by law, and hold harmless each Holder of Registrable
Securities, its officers and directors and each person who controls such
Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) from and against any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact
contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus,
or any amendment or supplement to any of them, or any omission or alleged
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same is contained
in any information furnished in writing to the Company by the Holder expressly
for use therein. The Company also shall indemnify any Underwriter of the
Registrable Securities, their officers and directors and each person who
controls such Underwriter (within the meaning of the Securities Act) on
substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the Holder
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 4.1_.

Section 4.2 Indemnification by Holders of Registrable Securities. In
connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of Registrable
Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the Company in
writing such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably requests
for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or Prospectus and,
to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify the Company, its directors and
officers and agents and each person who controls the Company (within the
meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys
fees) resulting from any untrue statement of material fact contained in
the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is
contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such
Holder expressly for use therein; _provided_ , that the obligation to
indemnify shall be several, not joint and several, among such Holders of
Registrable Securities, and the liability of each such Holder of Registrable
Securities shall be in proportion to and limited to the net proceeds received
by such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to
such Registration Statement. Each Holder shall indemnify any Underwriter of
Registrable Securities sold by such Holder, their officers, directors and each
person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities
Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with respect to
indemnification of the Company.

Section 4.3 Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. Any person entitled to
indemnification herein shall (i) give prompt written notice to the
indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification
(provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall not impair any
persons right to

 



11

    

 indemnification hereunder to the extent such failure has not materially
prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified partys
reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and
indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such
indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is assumed, the
indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement
made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or
elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the
fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such
indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable
judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between
such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect
to such claim. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the
indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement which cannot be settled in all respects by the payment of money
(and such money is so paid by the indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of
such settlement) or which settlement does not include as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party
of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

 

Section 4.4 Survival. The indemnification provided for under this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling
person of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities.
The Company and each Holder of Registrable Securities participating in an
offering also agrees to make such provisions as are reasonably requested by
any indemnified party for contribution to such party in the event the
Companys or such Holders indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

Section 4.5 Contribution. If the indemnification provided under  _Section_ __
_ 4.1_ hereof from the indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to
hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in
lieu of indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified
party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including
any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact, was made by, or relates to
information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and
the indemnifying partys and indemnified partys relative intent, knowledge,
access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action;
_provided_ , that the liability of any Holder under this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_
shall be limited to the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in
such offering giving rise to such liability. The amount paid or payable by a
party as a result of the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall
be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in _Sections 4.1_ ,
_4.2_ and _4.3_ above, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably
incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding.
The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation, which does not take account
of the equitable considerations referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

 

ARTICLE V

5.2.9 pursuant to a bona fide third-party tender offer, merger, stock sale,
recapitalization, consolidation or other transaction involving a Change in

merger, recapitalization, consolidation or other such transaction is not
completed, the Common Stock subject to this Agreement shall remain subject to
this Agreement; and

5.2.10 the establishment of a trading plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1
promulgated under the Exchange Act, provided that such plan does not provide

_provided_ , that in the case of any Transfer or distribution pursuant to
_Sections 2.2.2_ through _2.2.7_ , each donee, distributee or other
transferee shall agree in writing, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE VI

GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 6.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including _Schedule A_ hereto)
constitutes the entire understanding and agreement between the parties as to
the matters covered herein and supersedes and replaces any prior
understanding, agreement or statement of intent, in each case, written or
oral, of any and every nature with respect thereto.

Section 6.2 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted
to be delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be deemed properly delivered, given and received (a) upon receipt when
delivered by hand, (b) upon transmission, if sent by facsimile or electronic

service, specifying next day delivery, with proof of receipt. The addresses,
email addresses and

numbers as may be designated in writing hereafter, in the same manner, by any
such person.

Section 6.3 Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and the
rights, duties and obligations of the Company hereunder may not be assigned or
delegated by the Company in whole or in part. This Agreement and the rights,
duties and obligations of the Holders hereunder may be freely assigned or
delegated by such Holder in conjunction with and to the extent of any transfer
of Common Stock by any such Holder. This Agreement and the provisions hereof
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of each of the parties
and the permitted assigns of the applicable Holder or of any assignee of the
applicable Holder. This Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or
benefits on any persons that are not party hereto other than as expressly set
forth in  _Article 4_ and this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_. No assignment by any
party hereto of such partys rights, duties and obligations hereunder shall be
binding upon or obligate the Company unless and until the Company shall
have received (i) written notice of such assignment and (ii) the written
agreement of the assignee, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company,
to be bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement (which may be
accomplished by an addendum or certificate of joinder to this Agreement).

Section 6.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood
that all parties need not sign the same counterpart and such counterparts may
be delivered by the parties hereto via facsimile or electronic transmission.

 

Section 6.5 Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended or modified, and
any provision hereof may be waived, in whole or in part, at any time pursuant
to an agreement in writing executed by the Company and Holders holding a
majority of the Registrable Securities at such time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment hereto or waiver hereof
that adversely affects one Holder, solely in his, her or its capacity as a
holder of the shares of capital stock of the Company, in a manner that is
materially different from the other Holders (in such capacity) shall
require the consent of the Holder so affected. Any failure by any party at
any time to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement shall not be
construed a waiver of such provision or any other provisions hereof.

 

Section 6.6 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto.

Section 6.7 Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by,
interpreted under, and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the

State of New York, without giving effect to any choice-of-law provisions
thereof that would compel the application of the substantive laws of any other
jurisdiction.

 

Section 6.8 Specific Performance. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the
other parties hereto would be irreparably harmed and would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed by such first party in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached by such first party. Accordingly,
each party agrees that the other parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which such parties are entitled at law or in
equity.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Section 5.1 _Board Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall
be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the
powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation ("
_Bylaws_ "), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do
all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation,
subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate, and any Bylaws adopted by the stockholders of the
Corporation; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the
stockholders of the Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board
that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

 

Section 5.2 _Number, Election and Term_.

 

(a) The number of directors of the Corporation, other than those who may be
elected by the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock voting
separately by class or series, shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by
the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board.

 

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ hereof, the Board shall be divided into
three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I,
Class II, and Class III. The Board is authorized to assign members of the
Board already in office to Class I, Class II, or Class III. The term of the
initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate, the term of the initial Class II Directors
shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate, and the term of the initial Class III directors shall expire at
the third annual meeting of the stockholders following the effectiveness of
this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each succeeding annual
meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first
annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the
effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, each of the
successors elected to replace the class of directors whose term expires at
that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the
election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject
to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to _Section_ __ _
5.5_ hereof, if the number of directors that constitutes the Board is changed,
any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes
so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as
possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors
constituting the Board shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to
the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting
separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one
or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall
be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in
person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon.
The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions
thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid
classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (and
therefore such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.

 

(c) Subject to _ Section_ __ _ 5.5_ hereof, a director shall hold office
until the next annual meeting for the year in which his or her term expires
and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified, subject,
however, to such directors earlier death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification or removal.

 

(d) Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws shall so require, the
election of directors need not be by written ballot. The holders of shares of
Common Stock shall not have cumulative voting rights.

Section 5.3 _Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies_. Subject to _
Section_ __ _ 5.5_ hereof, newly created directorships resulting from an
increase in the number of directors and any vacancies on the Board resulting
from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal or other cause
may be filled solely and exclusively by a majority vote of the remaining
directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining
director (and not by stockholders), and any director so chosen shall hold
office for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors to which
the new directorship was added or in which the vacancy occurred and until his
or her successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such
directors earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or
removal.

Section 5.4 _Removal_. Subject to _ Section_ __ _ 5.5_ hereof, any or all
of the directors may be removed from office, but only for cause, by the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of all then
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, at
a meeting called for that purpose.

 

Section 5.5 _Preferred Stock Directors_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this _ Article_ __ _ V_, and except as otherwise required by law,
whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have
the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more
directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from
office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms
of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such
directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this
_ Article_ __ _ V_ unless expressly provided by such terms.

 

ARTICLE VI

BYLAWS 

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law,
the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend,
alter or repeal the Bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total
number of directors present at a regular or special meeting of the Board at
which there is a quorum or by unanimous written consent. The Bylaws also may
be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders of the
Corporation; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of
any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by
this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock
Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting
together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders of the
Corporation to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further,
however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the
Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been
valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

 

ARTICLE VII

 

SPECIAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS; ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT

 

Section 7.1 _Special Meetings_. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders
of any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, and to the requirements of
applicable law, special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be
called only by the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer of the
Corporation, or the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of
the Board, and the ability of the stockholders of the Corporation to call a
special meeting is hereby specifically denied. Except as provided in the
foregoing sentence, special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may
not be called by another person or persons.

Section 7.2 _Advance Notice_. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for
the election of directors and of business to be brought by stockholders
before any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in
the manner provided in the Bylaws.

Section 7.3 _Action by Written Consent_. Except as may be otherwise
provided for or fixed pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) relating to the rights
of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, subsequent to the
consummation of the Corporations initial public offering of securities (the
" _Offering_ "), any action required or permitted to be taken by the
stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called annual or
special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written
consent of the stockholders of the Corporation.

ARTICLE VIII

 

LIMITED LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 8.1 _Limitation of Director Liability_. A director of the Corporation
shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the
extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted
under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended unless
a director violated his or her duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law,
authorized unlawful payments of dividends, unlawful stock purchases or
unlawful redemptions, or derived improper personal benefit from its actions
as a director. Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence
shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the
Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to
the time of such amendment, modification or repeal.

Section 8.2 _Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless
each person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a party to
or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "
_proceeding_ ") by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation,
is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to
an employee benefit plan (an " _indemnitee_ "), whether the basis of such
proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer,
employee or agent, or in any other capacity while serving as a director,
officer, employee or agent, against all liability and loss suffered and
expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees, judgments, fines,
ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably
incurred by such indemnitee in connection with such proceeding. The
Corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law pay
the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an indemnitee in
defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding in advance of its
final disposition; provided, however, that, to the extent required by
applicable law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition
of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking, by or on
behalf of the indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified
under this _ Section_ __ _ 8.2_ or otherwise. The rights to indemnification
and advancement of expenses conferred by this _ Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall be
contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has
ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to
the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _ Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_,
except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses, the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to an
indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Board.

 

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any
indemnitee by this _ Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall not be exclusive of any other
rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

 



5

    

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this _ Section_ __ _ 8.2_ by
the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of
any other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate
inconsistent with this _ Section_ __ _ 8.2_, shall, unless otherwise
required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or
change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification
rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in
any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the
time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in
respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first
threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or
omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such
inconsistent provision.

(d) This _ Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall not limit the right of the Corporation,
to the extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify
and to advance expenses to persons other than indemnitees.

 

ARTICLE IX

Section 9.1 _Corporate Opportunities and_ __ _ Non-Employee_ __ _
Directors_.

(a) In recognition and anticipation that members of the Board who are not
employees of the Corporation (the "Non-Employee Directors") and their
respective Affiliates may now engage and may continue to engage in the same
or similar activities or related lines of business as those in which the
Corporation, directly or indirectly, may engage and/or other business
activities that overlap with or compete with those in which the Corporation,
directly or indirectly, may engage, the provisions of this __ _ Article IX_
are set forth to regulate and define the conduct of certain affairs of the
Corporation with respect to certain classes or categories of business
opportunities as they may involve any of the Non-Employee Directors or their
respective Affiliates and the powers, rights, duties and liabilities of the
Corporation and its directors, officers and stockholders in connection
therewith. For purposes of this __ _ Article IX_, (i) "Affiliate" shall mean,
(a) in respect of each Non-Employee Director, any Person that, directly or
indirectly, is controlled by such Non-Employee Director (other than the
Corporation and any entity that is controlled by the Corporation) and (b) in
respect of the Corporation, any Person that, directly or indirectly, is
controlled by the Corporation; and (ii) "Person" shall mean any individual,
corporation, general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, trust, association or any other entity.

(b) No Non-Employee Director (including any Non-Employee Director who serves
as an officer of the Corporation in both his or her director and officer
capacities) or his or her Affiliates (such Persons being referred to,
collectively, as "Identified Persons" and, individually, as an "Identified
Person") shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, have any duty to
refrain from directly or indirectly (1) engaging in the same or similar
business activities or lines of business in which the Corporation or any of
its Affiliates now engages or proposes to engage or (2) otherwise competing
with the Corporation or any of its Affiliates, and, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, no Identified Person shall be liable to the Corporation or
its stockholders or to any Affiliate of the Corporation for breach of any
fiduciary duty solely by reason of the fact that such Identified Person
engages in any such activities. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the
Corporation hereby renounces any interest or expectancy in, or right to be
offered an opportunity to participate in, any business opportunity which may
be a corporate opportunity for an Identified Person and the Corporation or any
of its Affiliates, except as provided in __ _ Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_ of this
__ _ Article IX_. Subject to said __ _ Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_ of this __ _
Article IX_, in the event that any Identified Person acquires knowledge of a
potential transaction or other business opportunity which may be a corporate
opportunity for itself, herself or himself and the Corporation or any of its
Affiliates, such Identified Person shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, have no duty to communicate or offer such transaction or other
business opportunity to the Corporation or any of its Affiliates and, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, shall not be liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders or to any Affiliate of the Corporation for breach of any
fiduciary duty as a stockholder, director or officer of the Corporation
solely by reason of the fact that such

 



6

    

 Identified Person pursues or acquires such corporate opportunity for itself,
herself or himself, or offers or directs such corporate opportunity to another
Person.

 

(c) The Corporation does not renounce its interest in any corporate
opportunity offered to any Non-Employee Director (including any Non-Employee
Director who serves as an officer of this Corporation) if such opportunity is
expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director
or officer of the Corporation, and the provisions of __ _ Section_ __ _
9.1(b)_ of this __ _Article IX_ shall not apply to any such corporate
opportunity.

 

(d) In addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this __ _
Article IX_, a corporate opportunity shall not be deemed to be a potential
corporate opportunity for the Corporation if it is a business opportunity that
(i) the Corporation is unable, financially or legally, or is not contractually
permitted to undertake, (ii) from its nature, is not in the line of the
Corporations business or is of no practical advantage to the Corporation or
(iii) is one in which the Corporation has no interest or reasonable
expectancy.

 

(e) To the fullest extent permitted by law, any Person purchasing or otherwise
acquiring any interest in any shares of capital stock of the Corporation
shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of
this __ _ Article IX_.

which is within the scope of  _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ immediately above is
filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a "

deemed to have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and
federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any
action brought in any such court to enforce _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ immediately
above (an " _FSC Enforcement Action_ ") and (ii) having service of process
made upon such stockholder in any such FSC Enforcement Action by service upon
such stockholders counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for
such stockholder.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the Sponsor, GigCapital3 and the Company hereby agree
as follows:

 

1\. _Voting Agreement_. The Sponsor agrees that, at the GigCapital3
Stockholders Meeting, at any other meeting of the stockholders
of GigCapital3 (whether annual or special and whether or not an adjourned or
postponed meeting, however called and including any adjournment or
postponement thereof) and in connection with any written consent of the
stockholders of GigCapital3, the Sponsor shall:

a. when such meeting is held, appear at such meeting or otherwise cause the
Sponsor Shares to be counted as present thereat for the purpose of
establishing a quorum;

b. vote (or execute and return an action by written consent), or cause to be
voted at such meeting (or validly execute and return and cause such consent
to be granted with respect to), all of the Sponsor Shares in favor of (i) the
approval and adoption of the BCA and approval of the Merger and all other
transactions contemplated by the BCA and (ii) against any action, agreement
or transaction or proposal that would result in a breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of GigCapital3
under the BCA or that would reasonably be expected to result in the failure
of the Merger from being consummated and (iii) each of the proposals and any
other matters necessary or reasonably requested by GigCapital3 for
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
BCA; and

c. vote (or execute and return an action by written consent), or cause to be
voted at such meeting (or validly execute and return and cause such consent

with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the Merger or

   

 any of the other transactions contemplated by the BCA, or (y) result in a
breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or
agreement of the Sponsor contained in this Agreement.

2\. _Transfer of Shares_. Except as otherwise contemplated by the BCA or this
Agreement, the Sponsor agrees that it shall not, directly or indirectly, (a)
sell, assign, transfer (including by operation of law), create any lien or
pledge, dispose of or otherwise encumber any of the Sponsor Shares or
otherwise agree to do any of the foregoing, (b) deposit any Sponsor Shares

this Agreement or (c) enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or
undertaking requiring the direct acquisition or sale, assignment, transfer or
other disposition of any Sponsor Shares.

3\. _No Solicitation of Transactions_. The Sponsor agrees not to directly or
indirectly, through any officer, director, representative, agent or otherwise,
(a) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by furnishing
information) the submission of, or participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, any transaction in violation of the BCA or (b)

encourage, any unsolicited proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Business Combination Proposal or other transaction in
violation of the BCA. Sponsor shall, and shall cause its affiliates and
Representatives to, immediately cease any and all existing discussions or

or result in, a Business Combination Proposal. If the Sponsor receives any
inquiry or proposal with respect to a Business Combination Proposal, then
Sponsor shall promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours
after the Sponsor becomes aware of such inquiry or proposal) notify such
person in writing that GigCapital3 is subject to an exclusivity agreement with
respect to the Merger that prohibits Sponsor from considering such inquiry or
proposal.

 

4\. _Representations and Warranties of the Sponsor_. The Sponsor hereby
represents and warrants to GigCapital3 and the Company as follows:

other transactions contemplated by the BCA. 

e. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Sponsor
does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or the

or result in (i) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the limited
liability company agreement or similar governing documents of the Sponsor,
(ii) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of,
a termination (or right of termination) of or a default under, the loss of any

the Sponsor pursuant to any contract binding upon the Sponsor or, assuming
(solely with respect to performance of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby), compliance with the matters referred to in
_ Section_ __ _ 1_, under any applicable Law to which the Sponsor is subject
or (iii) any change in the rights or obligations of any party under any
contract legally binding upon the Sponsor, except, in the case of clause (ii)
or (iii) directly above, for any such breach, violation, termination, default,
creation, acceleration or change that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or impair
the Sponsors ability to perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, the consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by the BCA.

f. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no action, proceeding or

Company.

 

8\. _Waiver_. No failure or delay by any party hereto exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and

Exhibit G

 

STOCKHOLDER SUPPORT AGREEMENT

 

STOCKHOLDER SUPPORT AGREEMENT, dated as of December 10, 2020 (this "
_Agreement_ "), by and among GigCapital3, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_GigCapital3_ "), and certain of the stockholders of Lightning Systems, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), whose names appear on the
signature pages of this Agreement (each, a " _Stockholder_ " and,
collectively, the " _Stockholders_ ").

WHEREAS, GigCapital3, Project Power Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and wholly owned subsidiary of GigCapital3 (" _Merger Sub_ "), and the Company
have negotiated a Business Combination Agreement in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit_ __ _ B_ (the " _BCA_ "; terms used but not defined in this
Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the BCA), which
provides, among other things, that, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the
" _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of GigCapital3; and

 

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, each Stockholder owns of record the number of
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock as set forth
opposite such Stockholders name on _ Exhibit A_ hereto (all such shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock and any shares of Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock of which ownership of record or the
power to vote is hereafter acquired by the Stockholders prior to the
termination of this Agreement being referred to herein as the " _Shares_ ").

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants
and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

1\. _BCA Approved; Agreement to Vote_. Each Stockholder, with respect to such
Stockholders Shares, severally and not jointly, hereby agrees to vote, at any
meeting of the stockholders of the Company, and in any action by written
consent of the stockholders of the Company (which written consent shall be
delivered promptly, and in any event within twenty four (24) hours, after the
Company requests such delivery), all of the Shares held by such Stockholder at
such time in favor of the approval and adoption of the BCA and approval of the
Merger and all other transactions contemplated by the BCA (including but not
limited to the conversion of all Company Preferred Stock into Company Common
Stock and the exercise or termination of all Company Warrants pursuant to the
Stockholders Agreement, in each case subject to and effective immediately
prior to the consummation of the Merger under the BCA) _provided_ in all cases
that no changes have been made in the BCA or in the Merger or related
transactions or ancillary agreements under the BCA that are material to one
or more of the Stockholders. Provided no changes are made in the BCA or in the
Merger or related transactions or ancillary agreements under the BCA that are
material to one or more of the Stockholders, each Stockholder, severally and
not jointly, hereby agrees to vote at any meeting of the stockholders of the
Company, and to act by written consent of Company stockholders, against any
action, agreement, transaction or proposal that would cause a material breach
of any covenant, representation, warranty or other obligation or agreement of
the Company under the BCA or that would reasonably be expected to prevent the
Merger from being consummated. Each Stockholder acknowledges receipt and
review of a copy of the BCA.

2\. _Termination of Stockholder Agreements, Related Agreements_. Subject to
the consummation of the Closing pursuant to the BCA each Stockholder,
severally and not jointly, hereby agrees that the following shall terminate
effective immediately prior to the Closing under the BCA (provided that all
Terminating Rights (as defined below) between the Company or any of
its subsidiaries and any other holder of Company capital stock shall also

stockholders of the Company named therein (the " _Voting Agreement_ " and,

rights under any letter agreement providing for redemption rights, put
rights, purchase rights or other similar rights not generally available to
stockholders of the Company (the " _Terminating Rights_ ") between Stockholder
and the Company, but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any rights such

   

 Stockholder may have that relate to any commercial or employment agreements
or arrangements between such Stockholder and the Company or any subsidiary,
which shall survive in accordance with their terms.

3\. _Transfer of Shares_. Each Stockholder, severally and not jointly, agrees
that it shall not, directly or indirectly, (a) sell, assign, transfer
(including by operation of law), create any lien or pledge, dispose of or
otherwise encumber any of the Shares or otherwise agree to do any of the
foregoing, except for a sale, assignment or transfer pursuant to the BCA or
to another stockholder of the Company that is a party to this Agreement and
bound by the terms and obligations hereof, (b) deposit any Shares into a
voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement or grant any
proxy or power of attorney with respect thereto that is inconsistent with
this Agreement or (c) enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or
undertaking with respect to the direct acquisition or sale, assignment,
transfer or other disposition of any Shares, except as set forth in the
Stockholders Agreement; provided, that the foregoing shall not prohibit the
transfer of the Shares to an affiliate of Stockholder, but only if such
affiliate of such Stockholder shall execute this Agreement or a joinder
agreeing to become a party to this Agreement.

4\. _No Solicitation of Transactions_. Each of the Stockholders severally and
not jointly, agrees not to directly or indirectly, through any officer,
director, representative, agent or otherwise, (a) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage (including by furnishing information) the submission of,
or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, any transaction
in violation of the BCA or (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person or other entity or "group" within the
meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, any information with the intent
to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with respect to, or knowingly assist,
participate in, facilitate or encourage, any unsolicited proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative
Transaction in violation of the BCA. Each Stockholder shall, and shall direct
its representatives and agents to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any discussions or negotiations with any parties that may be
ongoing with respect to any Alternative Transaction (other than the
transactions contemplated by the BCA) to the extent required by the BCA. If
any Stockholder receives any inquiry or proposal with respect to an
Alternative Transaction, then such Stockholder shall promptly (and in no
event later than twenty-four (24) hours after such Stockholder becomes aware
of such inquiry or proposal) notify such person in writing that the Company is
subject to an exclusivity agreement with respect to the sale of the Company
that prohibits such Stockholder from considering such inquiry or proposal.

5.  _Representations and Warranties_. Each Stockholder severally and not
jointly, represents and warrants to GigCapital3 as follows:

provision of such Stockholders governing documents.

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, such Stockholder owns exclusively of
record and has good and valid title to the Shares set forth opposite the
Stockholders name on _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ free and clear of any security
interest, lien, claim, pledge, proxy, option, right of first refusal,
agreement, voting restriction, limitation on disposition, charge, adverse
claim of ownership or use or other encumbrance of any kind and has the sole
power to vote and the right, power and authority to sell, transfer
and deliver such Shares, other than pursuant and subject to: (i) this
Agreement, (ii) applicable securities laws, (iii) the Companys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, (iv) the Stockholders Agreement and (v)
the Stockholder Agreements. Such Stockholder is not the registered owner of
any Shares other than those set forth on _Exhibit A_.

This SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT (this " _Subscription Agreement_ ") is entered

corporation (" _Lightning_ "), and Project Power Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, providing for the combination of the Company and Lightning (the "
_Transaction Agreement_ " and the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreement, the " _Transaction_ ");

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Subscription Agreement, the
Company is entering into Subscription Agreements with certain investors in
substantially the form attached to the Business Combination Agreement (the "
_Notes Subscription Agreements_ "), pursuant to which such investors, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Notes Subscription
Agreements, shall purchase from the Company, and the Company shall issue to
such investors, (i) $100,000,000 of unsecured promissory notes convertible
into shares of the Companys common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("
_Common Stock_ "), at a conversion price of $11.50 in accordance with the
terms thereof (the " _Convertible Notes_ "), and (ii) warrants to purchase up
to 8,695,652 shares of Common Stock for a per share exercise price of $11.50
(the transactions described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii),
collectively, the " _Notes Financing_ "), in each case to be consummated
concurrently with the Transaction; and

 

WHEREAS, in connection with the Transaction, Subscriber desires to subscribe
for and purchase from the Company, immediately prior to the consummation of
the Transaction, that number of shares of the Companys common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), set forth on the signature
page hereto (the " _Subscribed Shares_ ") for a purchase price of $10.00 per
share (the " _Per Share Price_ " and the aggregate of such Per Share Price for
all Subscribed Shares being referred to herein as the " _Purchase Price_ "),
and the Company desires to issue and sell to Subscriber the Subscribed Shares
in consideration of the payment of the Purchase Price by or on behalf of
Subscriber to the Company.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties and covenants, and subject to the

a custodian designated by Subscriber, as applicable, and (ii) written notice
from the Company or its transfer agent evidencing the issuance to Subscriber
of the Subscribed Shares on and as of the Closing Date. In the event that the

hand, or the Subscriber, on the other, of the conditions that, on the Closing

authority located outside the United States where such judgment, order, law,
rule or regulation would not be reasonably expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below)); and no such governmental
authority shall have instituted or threatened in writing a proceeding seeking
to impose any such restraint or prohibition (except in the case of
a governmental authority located outside the United States where such
restraint or prohibition would not be reasonably expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect); and

conditions that, on the Closing Date:

 

(i) all representations and warranties of Subscriber contained in this
Subscription Agreement are true and correct in all material respects (other
than representations and warranties that are qualified as to materiality or
Subscriber Material Adverse Effect (as defined below), which representations
and warranties shall be true in all respects) at and as of the Closing Date,
and consummation of the Closing shall constitute a reaffirmation by Subscriber
of each of the representations and warranties of Subscriber contained in this
Subscription Agreement as of the Closing; and

 



2

    

(ii) Subscriber shall have performed, satisfied and complied in all
material respects with all covenants, agreements and conditions required by
this Subscription Agreement to be performed, satisfied or complied with by it
at or prior to the Closing, except where the failure of such performance or
compliance would not or would not reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay, or materially impair the ability of the Company to
consummate the Closing.

 

e. The obligation of Subscriber to consummate the Closing shall be subject to
the satisfaction or valid waiver by Subscriber of the additional conditions
that, on the Closing Date:

(i) all representations and warranties of the Company contained in this

than representations and warranties that are qualified as to materiality or
Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below), which representations and
warranties shall be true in all respects) at and as of the Closing Date, and
consummation of the Closing shall constitute a reaffirmation by the Company of
each of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Subscription Agreement as of the Closing;

(ii) the Company shall have performed, satisfied and complied in all material
respects with all covenants, agreements and conditions required by this
Subscription Agreement to be performed, satisfied or complied with by it at or
prior to the Closing;

 

(iii) there shall have been no amendment, waiver or modification to the

_Section_ __ _ 3_, the term "Company" shall refer to the Company as of the
date hereof and, for purposes of only the representations contained in
subsections (f), (i), (k) and (n) of this _Section_ __ _ 3_ and to the
extent such representations and warranties are made as of the Closing Date,
the combined company after giving effect to the Transaction as of the Closing
Date. _ _ The Company represents and warrants to Subscriber that:

a. The Company (i) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware, (ii) has the requisite power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties, to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted and to enter into and perform its obligations
under this Subscription Agreement, and (iii) is duly licensed or qualified to
conduct its business and, if applicable, is in good standing under the laws of
each jurisdiction (other than its jurisdiction of incorporation) in which the
conduct of its business or the ownership of its properties or assets requires
such license or qualification, except, with respect to the foregoing clause
(iii), where the failure to be in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Subscription Agreement, a " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means an
event, change, development, occurrence, condition or effect with respect to
the Company and its subsidiaries, taken together as a whole (on a
consolidated basis), that, individually or in the aggregate, has a material
adverse effect on the business, financial condition, prospects or results of
operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken together as a whole (on
a consolidated basis).

b. The Subscribed Shares have been duly authorized and, when issued and
delivered to Subscriber against full payment therefor in accordance with the
terms of this Subscription Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable and will not have been issued in violation of any preemptive
rights created under the Companys organizational documents or the laws of the
State of Delaware.

c. The Subscribed Shares are not, and following the Closing, will not be,
subject to any Transfer Restriction. The term "Transfer Restriction" means any
condition to or restriction on the ability of the 

 



3

    

 undersigned to pledge, sell, assign or otherwise transfer the Shares under
any organizational document, policy or agreement of, by or with the Company,
but excluding the restrictions on transfer described in Section 4(e) of this
Subscription Agreement with respect to the status of the Shares as "restricted
securities" pending their registration for resale under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") in accordance with the terms of
this Subscription Agreement.

d. This Subscription Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company, and assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the
same by Subscriber, this Subscription Agreement shall constitute the valid and
legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting
creditors generally and by the availability of equitable remedies.

 

e. The execution and delivery of this Subscription Agreement, the issuance and
sale of the Subscribed Shares and the compliance by the Company with all of
the provisions of this Subscription Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein will not conflict with or result in a breach
or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default
under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or
encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of the Company pursuant to the
terms of (i) any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease,
license or other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or
by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the
Company is subject; (ii) the organizational documents of the Company; or (iii)
any statute or any judgment, order, rule or regulation of any court or
governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the
Company or any of its properties that, in the case of clauses (i) and (iii),
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
have a material adverse effect on the Companys ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the issuance and sale of the
Subscribed Shares.

 

f. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Subscriber, the Company is not required to obtain any consent, waiver,
authorization or order of, give any notice to, or make any filing or
registration with, any court or other federal, state, local or other
governmental authority, self-regulatory organization (including the New York
Stock Exchange or other person in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Subscription Agreement (including, without limitation, the
issuance of the Subscribed Shares), other than (i) filings required by
applicable state securities laws, (ii) the filing of the Registration
Statement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5_ below, (iii) those required by the
New York Stock Exchange, including with respect to obtaining stockholder
approval, (iv) those required to consummate the Transaction as provided under
the Transaction Agreement, (v) the filing of notification under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, if applicable, and (vi) the
failure of which to obtain would not be reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or have a material adverse effect on the Companys
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
issuance and sale of the Subscribed Shares.

 

g. As of their respective dates, all reports required to be filed by the
Company with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("
_Commission_ ")(the " _SEC Reports_ ") complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder,
and none of the SEC Reports, when filed, contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial
statements of the Company included in the SEC Reports comply in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the rules and regulations
of the Commission with respect thereto as in effect at the time of filing and
fairly present in all material respects the financial position of the Company
as of and for the dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows
for the periods then ended, subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal, year-end audit adjustments.

 

h. As of the date hereof and as of immediately prior to the Closing, the
authorized share capital of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares of

(and immediately after the consummation of the Transaction), the authorized
share capital of the Company will consist of 250,000,000 shares of Common
Stock and 1,000,000 Preferred Shares. As of the date hereof and as of
immediately prior to the Closing: (i) 25,893,479 shares of Common Stock and no
Preferred Shares were issued and outstanding; (ii) 15,670,108 warrants, each
exercisable to purchase a whole share of Common Stock at $11.50 per full share
(the " _Warrants_ "), were issued and outstanding; and (iii) no Common Stock
was subject to issuance upon exercise of outstanding options. As of the date
hereof, the Company had no outstanding long-term indebtedness (other than fees
payable under the business combination marketing agreement entered into in
connection with its initial public offering) and will not have any long-term
indebtedness immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that the Company
shall consummate the Notes Financing concurrently with the Closing and the
terms and conditions of the Note Financing shall be consistent with the
provisions of the term sheet for the Note Financing attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_. No Warrants are exercisable on or prior to the Closing. All (i)
issued and outstanding Common Stock has been duly authorized and validly
issued, is fully paid and non-assessable and is not subject to preemptive
rights and (ii) issued and outstanding Warrants and Rights constitute legal,
valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company
in accordance with their terms. As of the date hereof, except as set forth
above and pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, there are no outstanding
options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire from
the Company any Common Stock or other equity interests in the Company
(collectively, " _Equity Interests_ ") or securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for Equity Interests. As of the date hereof, the
Company has no subsidiaries and does not own, directly or indirectly,
interests or investments (whether equity or debt) in any person, whether
incorporated or unincorporated. There are no stockholder agreements, voting
trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the Company is a party
or by which it is bound relating to the voting of any Equity Interests, other
than (A) the letter agreements entered into by the Company in connection with
the Companys initial public offering on May 13, 2020 pursuant to which the
Companys sponsor and the Companys executive officers and independent
directors agreed to vote in favor of any proposed Business Combination (as
defined therein), which includes the Transaction, and (B) as contemplated by
the Transaction Agreement. There are no securities or instruments issued by or
to which the Company is a party containing anti-dilution or similar provisions
that will be triggered by the issuance of the Subscribed Shares.

i. Except for such matters as have not had and would not be reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or have a material adverse effect
on the Companys ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the issuance and sale of the Subscribed Shares, as of the date
hereof, there is no (i) suit, action, proceeding or arbitration before a
governmental authority or arbitrator pending, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened in writing against the Company or (ii) judgment, decree,
injunction, ruling or order of any governmental authority or arbitrator
outstanding against the Company.

j. The issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock are registered
pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the " _Exchange Act_ "), and are listed for trading on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol "GIK" (it being understood that the trading
symbol will be changed in connection with the Transaction). There is no suit,
action, proceeding or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company by the New York Stock Exchange or the
Commission with respect to any intention by such entity to deregister the
shares of Common Stock or prohibit or terminate the listing of the shares of
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange. The Company has taken no action
that is designed to terminate the registration of the shares of Common Stock
under the Exchange Act.

k. Assuming the accuracy of Subscribers representations and warranties set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 4_ of this Subscription Agreement, no registration
under the Securities Act is required for the offer and sale of the Subscribed
Shares by the Company to Subscriber.

 



5

    

l. Neither the Company nor any person acting on its behalf has engaged
or will engage in any form of general solicitation or general advertising
(within the meaning of Regulation D) in connection with any offer or sale of
the Subscribed Shares.

 

m. Except for the Placement Agent (as defined below), no broker or finder is
entitled to any brokerage or finders fee or commission from the Company
solely in connection with the sale of the Subscribed Shares to Subscriber.

n. Except for such matters as have not had a Company Material Adverse Effect,
the Company is, and has been since its inception, in compliance with all state
and federal laws applicable to the conduct of its business. The Company has
not received any written, or to its knowledge, other communication from a
governmental entity that alleges that the Company is not in compliance with or
is in default or violation of any applicable law, except where such non-
compliance, default or violation would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Except for such
matters as have not had and would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, there is no (i)
action, lawsuit, claim or other proceeding, in each case by or before any
governmental authority pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or (ii) judgment, decree, injunction, ruling
or order of any governmental entity or arbitrator outstanding against the
Company.

4\. _Subscriber Representations and Warranties_ _._ Subscriber represents and
warrants to the Company and the Placement Agent that:

a. Subscriber (i) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and (ii) has the
requisite power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under
this Subscription Agreement. 

b. This Subscription Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Subscriber, and assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the
same by the Company, this Subscription Agreement shall constitute the valid
and legally binding obligation of Subscriber, enforceable against Subscriber
in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting
creditors generally and by the availability of equitable remedies.

 

c. The execution and delivery of this Subscription Agreement, the purchase of
the Subscribed Shares and the compliance by Subscriber with all of the
provisions of this Subscription Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein will not conflict with or result in a breach
or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a
default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or
encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of Subscriber pursuant to the
terms of (i) any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease,
license or other agreement or instrument to which Subscriber is a party or by
which Subscriber is bound or to which any of the property or assets of
Subscriber is subject; (ii) the organizational documents of Subscriber; or
(iii) any statute or any judgment, order, rule or regulation of any court or
governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over
Subscriber or any of its properties that, in the case of clauses (i) and
(iii), would reasonably be expected to have a Subscriber Material Adverse
Effect. For purposes of this Subscription Agreement, a " _Subscriber Material
Adverse Effect_ " means an event, change, development, occurrence, condition
or effect with respect to Subscriber that would reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on Subscribers ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the purchase of the Subscribed
Shares.

 

d. Subscriber (i) is a "qualified institutional buyer" (as defined in Rule
144A under the Securities Act) or an institutional "accredited investor"
(within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities
Act) satisfying the applicable requirements set forth on Annex A hereto and an
"institutional account" as defined in FINRA Rule 4512(c), (ii) is acquiring
the Subscribed Shares only for its own account and not for the account of
others, or if Subscriber is subscribing for the Subscribed Shares as a
fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, each owner of such
account is a qualified institutional buyer and

 



6

    

 Subscriber has full investment discretion with respect to each such account,
and the full power and authority to make the acknowledgements, representations
and agreements herein on behalf of each owner of each such account, and (iii)
is not acquiring the Subscribed Shares with a view to, or for offer or sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act
(and has provided the Company with the requested information on Annex A
following the signature page hereto). Subscriber is not an entity formed for
the specific purpose of acquiring the Subscribed Shares.

 

e. Subscriber understands that the Subscribed Shares are being offered in a
transaction not involving any public offering within the meaning of the
Securities Act and that the Subscribed Shares have not been registered under
the Securities Act. Subscriber understands that the Subscribed Shares may not
be resold, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of by Subscriber absent
an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, except (i) to
the Company or a subsidiary thereof, or (ii) pursuant to an applicable
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and, in
each of cases (i) and (ii), in accordance with any applicable securities laws
of the applicable states and other jurisdictions of the United States, and

to making any offer, resale, pledge or transfer of any of the Subscribed
Shares.

certificate (if any) evidencing the Shares shall be stamped or otherwise
imprinted with a legend, in substantially the following form:

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED
STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE
OR OTHER JURISDICTION, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF
SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM.

 

f. Subscriber understands and agrees that Subscriber is purchasing the
Subscribed Shares directly from the Company. Subscriber further acknowledges
that there have not been, and Subscriber hereby agrees that it is not relying
on, any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made to
Subscriber by the Company, any other party to the Transaction or any other
person or entity (including the Placement Agent), expressly or by
implication, other than those representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Company set forth in this Subscription Agreement. Subscriber
acknowledges that certain information provided by the Company was based on
projections, and such projections were prepared based on assumptions and
estimates that are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of
significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the
projections.

g. In making its decision to purchase the Subscribed Shares, Subscriber has
relied solely upon independent investigation made by Subscriber. Subscriber
acknowledges and agrees that Subscriber has received such information as
Subscriber deems necessary in order to make an investment decision with
respect to the Subscribed Shares, including with respect to the Company and
the Transaction (including Lightning and its respective subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Acquired Companies_ ")). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Subscriber acknowledges that Subscriber has
reviewed the Companys filings with the Commission. Subscriber represents and
agrees that Subscriber and Subscribers professional advisor(s), if any, have
had the full opportunity to ask such questions, receive such answers and
obtain such information as Subscriber and such undersigneds professional
advisor(s), if any, have deemed necessary to make an investment decision with
respect to the Subscribed Shares. Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that
none of Oppenheimer and Co. Inc. and Nomura Securities International, Inc., each
acting as a placement agent to the Company (the " _Placement Agent_ "), nor
any affiliate of the Placement Agent has provided

 



7

    

 Subscriber with any information or advice with respect to the Subscribed
Shares nor is such information or advice necessary or desired. Neither the
Placement Agent nor any of its affiliates has made or makes any
representation as to the Company or the Acquired Companies or the quality or
value of the Subscribed Shares and the Placement Agent and any of its
respective affiliates may have acquired non-public information with respect
to the Company or the Acquired Companies which Subscriber agrees need not be
provided to it. In connection with the issuance of the Subscribed Shares to
Subscriber, neither the Placement Agent nor any of its affiliates has acted
as a financial advisor or fiduciary to Subscriber.

h. Subscriber became aware of this offering of the Subscribed Shares solely
by means of direct contact between Subscriber and the Company or by means of
contact from the Placement Agent, Lightning and/or their respective advisors
(including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, bankers, consultants
and financial advisors), agents, control persons, representatives, affiliates,
directors, officers, managers, members, and/or employees, and/or the
representatives of such persons (such parties referred to collectively as "
_Representatives_ "). The Subscribed Shares were offered to Subscriber solely
by direct contact between Subscriber and the Company, the Placement Agent,
Lightning and/or their respective Representatives. Subscriber acknowledges
that it is not relying upon, and has not relied upon, any statement,
representation or warranty made by any person or entity (including, without
limitation, the Company, the Placement Agent, Lightning and/or their
respective Representatives), other than the representations and warranties
contained in this Subscription Agreement, in making its investment or decision
to invest in the Company. Subscriber did not become aware of this offering of
the Subscribed Shares, nor were the Subscribed Shares offered to Subscriber,
by any other means, and none of the Company, the Placement Agent, Lightning or
their respective Representatives acted as investment advisor, broker or dealer
to Subscriber. Subscriber acknowledges that the Company represents and
warrants that the Subscribed Shares (i) were not offered by any form of
general solicitation or general advertising and (ii) are not being offered in
a manner involving a public offering under, or in a distribution in violation
of, the Securities Act, or any state securities laws.

i. Subscriber acknowledges that it is aware that there are substantial risks
incident to the purchase and ownership of the Subscribed Shares. Subscriber
has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Subscribed
Shares, and Subscriber has had an opportunity to seek, and has sought, such
accounting, legal, business and tax advice as Subscriber has considered
necessary to make an informed investment decision.

 

j. Alone, or together with any professional advisor(s), Subscriber represents
and acknowledges that Subscriber has adequately analyzed and fully considered
the risks of an investment in the Subscribed Shares and determined that the
Subscribed Shares are a suitable investment for Subscriber and that Subscriber
is able at this time and in the foreseeable future to bear the economic risk
of a total loss of Subscribers investment in the Company. Subscriber
acknowledges specifically that a possibility of total loss exists.

 

k. Subscriber understands and agrees that no federal or state agency has
passed upon or endorsed the merits of the offering of the Subscribed Shares
or made any findings or determination as to the fairness of this investment.

l. Subscriber is not (i) a person or entity named on the List of Specially
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons administered by the U.S. Treasury
Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control (" _OFAC_ ") or in any Executive
Order issued by the President of the United States and administered by OFAC,
or a person or entity prohibited by any OFAC sanctions program, or a person or
entity whose property and interests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction
are otherwise blocked under any U.S. laws, Executive Orders or regulations,
(ii) a person or entity listed on the Sectoral Sanctions Identifications ("
_SSI_ ") List maintained by OFAC or otherwise determined by OFAC to be subject
to one or more of the Directives issued under Executive Order 13662 of March
20, 2014, or on any other of the OFAC Consolidated Sanctions Lists, (iii) an
entity owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50
percent or more by one or more persons described in subsections (i) or (ii),
(iv) a person or entity named on the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of
Industry and Security (" _BIS_ ") Denied Persons List, Entity List, or
Unverified List (" _BIS Lists_ ") (collectively with (i) through (iv), a "
_Restricted Person_ ") or (v) a

 



8

    

 non-U.S. shell bank or providing banking services indirectly to a non-U.S.
shell bank. Subscriber agrees to provide law enforcement agencies, if
requested thereby, such records as required by applicable law, provided that
Subscriber is permitted to do so under applicable law. Subscriber represents
that if it is a financial institution subject to the Bank Secrecy Act (31
U.S.C. Section 5311 et seq.), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and
its implementing regulations (collectively, the " _BSA/PATRIOT Act_ "), that
Subscriber maintains policies and procedures reasonably designed to comply
with applicable obligations under the BSA/PATRIOT Act. Subscriber also
represents that, to the extent required, it maintains policies and procedures
reasonably designed for the screening of its investors against the OFAC and
BIS sanctions programs, including for Restricted Persons, and otherwise to
ensure compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws, statutes,
and regulations. Subscriber further represents and warrants that, to the
extent required, it maintains policies and procedures reasonably designed to
ensure that the funds held by Subscriber and used to purchase the Subscribed
Shares were legally derived.

 

m. Subscriber does not have, as of the date hereof, and during the 30-day
period immediately prior to the date hereof such Subscriber has not entered
into, any "put equivalent position" as such term is defined in Rule 16a-1
under the Exchange Act or short sale positions with respect to the securities
of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Subscriber
that is a multi-managed investment vehicle whereby separate portfolio managers
manage separate portions of such Subscribers assets and the portfolio
managers have no direct knowledge of the investment decisions made by the
portfolio managers managing other portions of such Subscribers assets, the
representation set forth above shall only apply with respect to the portion
of assets managed by the portfolio manager that made the investment decision
to purchase the Subscribed Shares covered by this Agreement.

 

n. If Subscriber is an employee benefit plan that is subject to Title I of
ERISA, a plan, an individual retirement account or other arrangement that is
subject to Section 4975 of the Code or an employee benefit plan that is a
governmental plan (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), a church plan (as
defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA), a non-U.S. plan (as described in Section
4(b)(4) of ERISA) or other plan that is not subject to the foregoing but may
be subject to provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or
other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or an entity whose underlying
assets are considered to include "plan assets" of any such plan, account or
arrangement (each, a " _Plan_ ") subject to the fiduciary or prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, the Subscriber
represents and warrants that neither the Company, nor any of its respective
affiliates (the " _Transaction Parties_ ") has acted as the Plans fiduciary,
or has been relied on for advice, with respect to its decision to acquire and
hold the Subscribed Shares, and none of the Transaction Parties shall at any
time be relied upon as the Plans fiduciary with respect to any decision to
acquire, continue to hold or transfer the Subscribed Shares.

 

o. Subscriber at the Closing will have sufficient funds to pay the Purchase
Price pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2(b)_ of this Subscription Agreement.

p. No disclosure or offering document has been prepared by the Placement
Agent in connection with the offer and sale of the Subscribed Shares. The
Placement Agent and each of its directors, officers, employees,
representatives and controlling persons have made no independent investigation
with respect to the Company or the Subscribed Shares or the accuracy,
completeness or adequacy of any information supplied to the Subscriber by the
Company. In connection with the issue and purchase of the Common Stock, the
Placement Agent has not acted as the Subscribers financial advisor or
fiduciary.

q. Subscriber agrees that, notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _ 8(i)_ of this
Subscription Agreement, the Placement Agent may rely upon the representations
and warranties made by Subscriber to the Company in this Subscription
Agreement.

 

5\. _Registration of Subscribed Shares_.

 

a. The Company agrees that, within forty five (45) calendar days after the
consummation of the Transaction (the " _Filing Deadline_ "), the Company will
file with the Commission (at the Companys sole

 



9

    

 cost and expense) a registration statement (the " _Registration Statement_
") registering the resale of the Subscribed Shares, and the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but no
later than the 60th calendar day (or 120th calendar day if the Commission
notifies the Company that it will "review" the Registration Statement)
following the Filing Deadline (such date, the " _Effectiveness Date_
"); provided, however, that the Companys obligations to include the
Subscribed Shares in the Registration Statement are contingent upon the
undersigned furnishing in writing to the Company such information regarding
the undersigned, the securities of the Company held by the undersigned and
the intended method of disposition of the Subscribed Shares as shall be
reasonably requested by the Company to effect the registration of the
Subscribed Shares, and shall execute such documents in connection with such
registration as the Company may reasonably request that are customary of a
selling stockholder in similar situations. The Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the continuous effectiveness of
the Registration Statement, and to be supplemented and amended to the extent
necessary to ensure that such Registration Statement is available or, if not
available, that another registration statement is available for the resale of
the Subscribed Shares, until the earliest of (i) the date on which the
Subscribed Shares may be resold without volume or manner of sale limitations
pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, (ii) the date on
which such Subscribed Shares have actually been sold and (iii) the date which
is two years after the Closing. For purposes of clarification, any failure by
the Company to file the Registration Statement by the Filing Deadline or to
effect such Registration Statement by the Effectiveness Date shall not
otherwise relieve the Company of its obligations to file or effect the
Registration Statement set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5_.

 

b. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Subscription Agreement,
the Company shall be entitled to delay or postpone the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, and from time to time to require any Subscriber not to
sell under the Registration Statement or to suspend the effectiveness thereof,
if the negotiation or consummation of a transaction by the Company or its
subsidiaries is pending or an event has occurred, which negotiation,
consummation or event, the Companys board of directors reasonably believes,
upon the advice of legal counsel, would require additional disclosure by the
Company in the Registration Statement of material information that the
Company has a bona fide business purpose for keeping confidential and the non-
disclosure of which in the Registration Statement would be expected, in
the reasonable determination of the Companys board of directors, upon the
advice of legal counsel, to cause the Registration Statement to fail to comply
with applicable disclosure requirements (each such circumstance, a "
_Suspension Event_ "); provided, however, that the Company may not delay or
suspend the Registration Statement on more than two occasions or for more than
sixty (60) consecutive calendar days, or more than ninety (90) total calendar
days, in each case during any twelve-month period. Upon receipt of any
written notice from the Company of the happening of any Suspension Event
(which notice shall not contain material non-public information) during the
period that the Registration Statement is effective or if as a result of a
Suspension Event the Registration Statement or related prospectus contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made (in the case of the
prospectus) not misleading, Subscriber agrees that (i) it will immediately
discontinue offers and sales of the Subscribed Shares under the Registration
Statement (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, sales conducted pursuant to
Rule 144) until such Subscriber receives copies of a supplemental or amended
prospectus (which the Company agrees to promptly prepare) that corrects the
misstatement(s) or omission(s) referred to above and receives notice that any
post-effective amendment has become effective or unless otherwise notified by
the Company that it may resume such offers and sales, and (ii) it will
maintain the confidentiality of any information included in such written
notice delivered by the Company unless otherwise required by law or subpoena.
If so directed by the Company, Subscriber will deliver to the Company or,
in such Subscribers sole discretion destroy, all copies of the prospectus
covering the Subscribed Shares in such Subscribers possession; provided,
however, that this obligation to deliver or destroy all copies of the
prospectus covering the Subscribed Shares shall not apply (i) to the extent
such Subscriber is required to retain a copy of such prospectus (a) in order
to comply with applicable legal, regulatory, self-regulatory or professional 

 



10

    

 requirements or (b) in accordance with a bona fide pre-existing document
retention policy or (ii) to copies stored electronically on archival servers
as a result of automatic data back-up.

c. The Company shall, notwithstanding any termination of this Subscription
Agreement, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Subscriber (to the extent a
seller under the Registration Statement), and its officers, directors and
agents, and each person who controls such Subscriber (within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys fees) and expenses (collectively, " _Losses_ "), as
incurred, that arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any
prospectus included in the Registration Statement or any form of prospectus or
in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or
arising out of or relating to any omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of any prospectus or form of prospectus or
supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were made)
not misleading, or (ii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of
the Securities Act, Exchange Act or any state securities law or any rule or
regulation thereunder, in connection with the performance of its obligations
under this  _Section_ __ _ 5_, except to the extent, but only to the extent,
that such untrue statements, alleged untrue statements, omissions or alleged
omissions are based upon information regarding such Subscriber furnished in
writing to the Company by such Subscriber expressly for use therein or such
Subscriber has omitted a material fact from such information or otherwise
violated the Securities Act, Exchange Act or any state securities law or any
rule or regulation thereunder; provided, however, that the indemnification
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5_ shall not apply to amounts paid in
settlement of any Losses if such settlement is effected without the consent of
the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), nor shall the Company be liable for any Losses to the extent they
arise out of or are based upon a violation which occurs (A) in reliance upon
and in conformity with written information furnished by a Subscriber, (B) in
connection with any failure of such person to deliver or cause to be delivered
a prospectus made available by the Company in a timely manner, (C) as a result
of offers or sales effected by or on behalf of any person by means of a
freewriting prospectus (as defined in Rule 405) that was not authorized in
writing by the Company, or (D) in connection with any offers or sales effected
by or on behalf of a Subscriber in violation of  _Section_ __ _ 5(b)_ of
this Subscription Agreement. The Company shall notify such Subscriber promptly
of the institution, threat or assertion of any proceeding arising from or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5_ of
which the Company is aware. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and
effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of an indemnified
party and shall survive the transfer of the Subscribed Shares by such
Subscriber.

d. If the total number of shares of Common Stock that the Subscriber and any
other person(s) intend to include in an underwritten offering exceeds the
number of shares of Common Stock that can be sold in an underwritten offering
without being likely to have an adverse effect on the price, timing or
distribution of shares of the Common Stock offered or the market for the
shares of Common Stock, then the shares of Common Stock to be included in such
offering shall include the number of shares of Common Stock that the managing
underwriter of the offering advises the Company can be sold without having
such adverse effect, with such number to be allocated (i) first, to the
Company or other party or parties requesting or initiating such registration
or to any other holder of securities of the Company having rights
of registration pursuant to an existing registration rights agreement and
(ii) second, by the Subscriber who has requested participation in such
underwritten offering and by the other holders of shares of Common Stock with
registration rights entitling them to participate in such underwritten
offering, allocated among the Subscriber and other holders pro rata on the
basis of the number of shares of Common Stock proposed to be sold by each
applicable holder in such underwritten offering (based, for each such
participant, on the percentage derived by dividing (x) the number of shares of
Common Stock proposed to be sold by such participant in such underwritten
offering by (y) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock proposed to be
sold by all participants in such underwritten offering) or in such manner as
they may agree.

 



11

    

e. Subscriber shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
directors, officers, agents and employees, and each person who controls the
Company (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20
of the Exchange Act), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from
and against all Losses, as incurred, arising out of or based upon any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration
Statement, any prospectus included in the Registration Statement, or any form
of prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any
preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or relating to any omission or
alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein (in the case of any prospectus, or any form of
prospectus or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made) not misleading to the extent, but only to the extent, that
such untrue statements or omissions are based upon information regarding such
Subscriber furnished in writing to the Company by such Subscriber expressly
for use therein; provided, however, that the indemnification contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 5_ shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any
Losses if such settlement is effected without the consent of such Subscriber
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In
no event shall the liability of any Subscriber be greater in amount than the
dollar amount of the net proceeds received by such Subscriber upon the sale of
the Subscribed Shares giving rise to such indemnification obligation.
Subscriber shall notify the Company promptly of the institution, threat or
assertion of any proceeding arising from or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5_ of which such Subscriber
is aware. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of an indemnified party and shall
survive the transfer of the Subscribed Shares by such Subscriber.

6\. _Termination_. This Subscription Agreement shall terminate and be void
and of no further force and effect, and all rights and obligations of the
parties hereunder shall terminate without any further liability on the part of
any party in respect thereof, upon the earlier to occur of (a) such date and
time as the Transaction Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms,
(b) upon the mutual written agreement of the Company and the Subscriber to
terminate this Subscription Agreement, (c) if, on the Closing Date of the
Transaction, any of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2_
of this Subscription Agreement have not been satisfied as of the time required
hereunder to be so satisfied or waived (to the extent a valid waiver is
capable of being issued) by the party entitled to grant such waiver and, as a
result thereof, the transactions contemplated by this Subscription Agreement
are not consummated, or (d) June 30, 2021 (the " _Outside Date_ "); provided,
that nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for any willful
breach hereof (including, for the avoidance of doubt, a Subscribers willful
breach of  _Section_ __ _ 2(c)_ of this Subscription Agreement with respect
to its representations, warranties and covenants as of the date of the
Closing) prior to the time of termination, and each party will be entitled to
any remedies at law or in equity to recover losses, liabilities or damages
arising from such breach. The Company shall notify Subscriber of the
termination of the Transaction Agreement promptly after the termination
thereof.

 

7\. _Trust Account Waiver_. Subscriber hereby acknowledges that the Company
has established a trust account (the " _Trust Account_ ") containing the
proceeds of its initial public offering (the " _IPO_ ") and from certain
private placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO (including interest
accrued from time to time thereon) for the benefit of the Companys public
stockholders and certain other parties (including the underwriters of the
IPO). For and in consideration of the Company entering into this Subscription
Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Subscriber hereby (i) agrees
that it does not now and shall not at any time hereafter have any right,
title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any assets held in the Trust
Account, and shall not make any claim against the Trust Account, regardless
of whether such claim arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in
any way to this Subscription Agreement or any other matter, and regardless of
whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory
of legal liability (any and all such claims are collectively referred to
hereafter as the " _Released Claims_ "), (ii) irrevocably waives any Released
Claims that it may have against the Trust Account now or in the future as a
result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with
the Company, and (iii) will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for
any reason whatsoever; provided however, that nothing in this _Section_ __ _
7_ shall be deemed to limit any Subscribers right to distributions from the
Trust Account in

 



12

    

 accordance with the Companys amended and restated certificate of
incorporation in respect of any redemptions by Subscriber of its shares of
public Common Stock of the Company acquired by any means other than pursuant
to this Subscription Agreement. Subscriber agrees not to seek recourse or make
or bring any action, suit, claim or other proceeding against the Trust Account
as a result of, or arising out of, this Subscription Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby or the Subscribed Shares regardless of
whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory
of legal liability. Each Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that it shall not
have any redemption rights with respect to the Subscribed Shares pursuant to
the Companys organizational documents in connection with the Transaction or
any other business combination, any subsequent liquidation of the Trust
Account, the Company or otherwise. In the event Subscriber has any claim
against the Company as a result of, or arising out of, this Subscription
Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the Subscribed Shares, it
shall pursue such claim solely against the Company and its assets outside the
Trust Account and not against the Trust Account or any monies or other assets
in the Trust Account.

8.  _Miscellaneous_.

a. All notices, requests, demands, claims, and other communications hereunder
shall be in writing. Any notice, request, demand, claim, or other

b. Subscriber acknowledges that the Company and others (including Placement
Agent) will rely on the acknowledgments, understandings, agreements,
representations and warranties contained in this Subscription Agreement. Prior
to the Closing, Subscriber agrees to promptly notify the Company and the
Placement Agent if it becomes aware that any of the
acknowledgments, understandings, agreements, representations and warranties
of Subscriber set forth herein are no longer accurate in all material
respects. The Company acknowledges that Subscriber and others (including
Placement Agent) will rely on the acknowledgments, understandings,
agreements, representations and warranties contained in this Subscription
Agreement. Prior to the Closing, the Company agrees to promptly notify
Subscriber if it becomes aware that any of the
acknowledgments, understandings, agreements, representations and warranties
of the Company set forth herein are no longer accurate in all material

this Subscription Agreement or a copy hereof to any interested party in any
administrative or legal proceeding or official inquiry with respect to the
matters covered hereby.

 

d. Subscriber shall pay all of its own expenses in connection with this
Subscription Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein.

e. Neither this Subscription Agreement nor any rights that may accrue to
Subscriber hereunder (other than the Subscribed Shares acquired hereunder, if
any) may be transferred or assigned. Neither this Subscription Agreement nor
any rights that may accrue to the Company hereunder may be transferred or
assigned (provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company may
transfer the Subscription Agreement and its rights hereunder solely in
connection with the consummation of the Transaction and exclusively to another
entity under the control of, or under common control with, the
Company). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Subscriber may assign its rights and
obligations under this Subscription Agreement to one or more of its affiliates
(including other investment funds or accounts managed or advised by the
investment manager who acts on behalf of the Subscriber) or, with the
Companys prior written consent, to another person, provided that no such
assignment shall relieve Subscriber of its obligations hereunder if any such

 



13

    

 assignee fails to perform such obligations, unless the Company has given its
prior written consent to such relief.

 

f. All the agreements, representations and warranties made by each party
hereto in this Subscription Agreement shall survive the Closing.

g. The Company may request from Subscriber such additional information as the
Company may reasonably deem necessary to evaluate the eligibility of
Subscriber to acquire the Subscribed Shares, and Subscriber shall provide such
information as may be reasonably requested, to the extent readily available
and to the extent consistent with its internal policies and procedures
provided that Company agrees to keep any such information provided by
Subscriber confidential.

h. This Subscription Agreement may not be amended, modified, waived or
terminated except by an instrument in writing, signed by the party against
whom enforcement of such modification, waiver, or termination is sought;
provided, that this Subscription Agreement may be amended, modified, waived
or terminated with the written consent of the Company and the Subscriber then
holding a majority of the Subscribed Shares then committed to be purchased at
the Closing by (or, if after the Closing, then held by) the Subscriber (the "
_Required Subscriber_ "), and provided further, that _Section_ __ _ 4_, this
_Section_ __ _ 8(h)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8(j)_ of this
Subscription Agreement may not be amended, terminated or waived in a manner
that is material and adverse to the Placement Agent without the written
consent of the Placement Agent. Upon the effectuation of such waiver,
modification, amendment or termination with the consent of the Required
Subscriber (and if required, the Placement Agent) in conformance with this
_Section_ __ _ 8(h)_, such amendment, modification, waiver or termination
shall be binding on the Subscriber and effective as to all of this
Subscription Agreement. The Company shall promptly give written notice thereof
to Subscriber if Subscriber has not previously consented to such amendment,
modification, waiver or termination in writing; provided that the failure to
give such notice shall not affect the validity of such amendment,
modification, waiver or termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, (i) no amendment, modification or waiver shall be effective against
the Subscriber unless such amendment, modification or waiver applies to the
Subscriber, (ii) any amendment, modification or waiver that has a
disproportionate effect on a Subscriber (considered apart from any
disproportionate effect owing to the number of Subscribed Shares held by such
Subscriber), shall require the consent of such Subscriber, (iii) any amendment
to _Section_ __ _ 3(i)_, _Section_ __ _ 5_, or _Section_ __ _ 6_ (to extend
the Outside Date beyond June 30, 2021) of this Subscription Agreement and
(iv) any amendment, modification or other change that alters the Per Share
Purchase Price, the Purchase Price, or the number of Subscribed Shares shall
require the consent of the undersigned Subscriber.

i. This Subscription Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, and
supersedes all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties, both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof, except that any confidentiality agreement with respect
to the undersigned or its affiliates shall remain in full force and effect.

j. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Subscription Agreement shall be
binding upon, and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their heirs,
executors, administrators, successors, legal representatives, and permitted
assigns, and the agreements, representations, warranties, covenants and
acknowledgments contained herein shall be deemed to be made by, and be
binding upon, such heirs, executors, administrators, successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. The parties hereto agree that the
Placement Agent is an express third-party beneficiary of its express rights
in _Section_ __ _ 3_, _Section_ __ _ 4_, _Section_ __ _ 8(h)_ and this
_Section_ __ _ 8(j)_ of this Subscription Agreement. Each of the parties
hereto shall be entitled to seek and obtain equitable relief, without proof
of actual damages, including an injunction or injunctions or order for
specific performance to prevent breaches of this Subscription Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Subscription Agreement
to cause Subscriber to fund the Purchase Price and cause the Closing to occur
if the conditions in _Section_ __ _ 2(c)_ this Subscription Agreement have
been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waived. Each
party hereto further agrees that the none of the parties hereto or the
Placement Agent shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or
similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 8(j)_, and each party

 



14

    

 hereto irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument

such representations and warranties are made as of the Closing Date, the
combined company after giving effect to the Transaction as of the Closing
Date. __ The Company represents and warrants to Subscriber that:

 

a. The Company (i) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing

b. The Subscribed Securities have been duly authorized and, when issued
and delivered to Subscriber against full payment therefor in accordance with
the terms of this Subscription Agreement, will be validly issued and will
constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with their terms, except that the
enforcement thereof may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar laws affecting creditors rights generally or by equitable principles
relating to enforceability (collectively, the " _Enforceability Exceptions_
"), and will not have been issued in violation of any preemptive rights
created under the Companys organizational documents or the laws of the State
of Delaware. The Indenture has been duly authorized by the Company and, when
duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee, will constitute a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company, respectively, in accordance with its terms, except that
the enforcement thereof may be subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

c. The Subscribed Securities are not, and following the Closing, will not be,
subject to any Transfer Restriction. The term "Transfer Restriction" means any
condition to or restriction on the ability of the undersigned to pledge, sell,
assign or otherwise transfer the Notes or the Warrants under any
organizational document, policy or agreement of, by or with the Company, but
excluding the restrictions on transfer described in the Indenture, the Warrant
Agreement and Section 4(C) of this Subscription Agreement with respect to the

_Securities Act_ ") in accordance with the terms of this Subscription
Agreement.

 

d. This Subscription Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company, and assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the
same by Subscriber, this Subscription Agreement shall constitute the valid and
legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

e. The execution and delivery of this Subscription Agreement, the issuance and
sale of the Subscribed Securities and the compliance by the Company with all
of the provisions of this Subscription Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein will not conflict with or result in a breach
or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default
under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or
encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of the Company pursuant to the
terms of (i) any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease,
license or other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by
which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the
Company is subject; (ii) the organizational documents of the Company; or
(iii) any statute or any judgment, order, rule or regulation of any court or
governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the
Company or any of its properties that, in the case of clauses (i) and
(iii), would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect
or have a material adverse effect on the Companys ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the issuance and sale of the
Subscribed Securities. 

f. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Subscriber, the Company is not required to obtain any consent, waiver,
authorization or order of, give any notice to, or make any filing or
registration with, any court or other federal, state, local or other
governmental authority, self-regulatory organization (including the New York

Company Material Adverse Effect or have a material adverse effect on the
Companys ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the issuance and sale of the Subscribed Securities.

 

g. As of their respective dates, all reports required to be filed by the
Company with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("
_Commission_ ") (the " _SEC Reports_ ") complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder,
and none of the SEC Reports, when filed, contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial
statements of the Company included in the SEC Reports comply in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the rules and regulations
of the Commission with respect thereto as in effect at the time of filing and
fairly present in all material respects the financial position of the Company
as of and for the dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows

normal, year-end audit adjustments.

issued and outstanding; (ii) 15,670,108 warrants, each exercisable to
purchase a whole share of Common Stock at $11.50 per full share (the "
_Warrants_ "), were issued and outstanding; and (iii) no Common Stock was

hereof, the Company had no outstanding long-term indebtedness (other than fees
payable under the business combination marketing agreement entered into in
connection with its initial public offering) and will not have any long-term
indebtedness immediately prior to the Closing. No Warrants are exercisable on
or prior to the Closing. All (i) issued and outstanding Common Stock has been
duly authorized and validly issued, is fully paid and non-assessable and is
not subject to preemptive rights and (ii) issued and outstanding Warrants and
Rights constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms. As of the
date hereof, except as set forth above and pursuant to (i) the Other
Subscription Agreements, or (ii) the Transaction Agreement, there are no
outstanding options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or
acquire from the Company any Common Stock or other equity interests in the
Company (collectively, " _Equity Interests_ ") or securities convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for Equity Interests. As of the date hereof,
the Company has no subsidiaries and does not own, directly or indirectly,
interests or investments (whether equity or debt) in any person, whether
incorporated or unincorporated. There are no stockholder agreements,
voting trusts or

 



6

    

 other agreements or understandings to which the Company is a party or by
which it is bound relating to the voting of any Equity Interests, other than
(A) the letter agreements entered into by the Company in connection with the
Companys initial public offering on May 13, 2020 pursuant to which the
Companys sponsor and the Companys executive officers and independent
directors agreed to vote in favor of any proposed Business Combination (as
defined therein), which includes the Transaction, and (B) as contemplated by
the Transaction Agreement. There are no securities or instruments issued by or
to which the Company is a party containing anti-dilution or similar
provisions that will be triggered by the issuance of (i) the Subscribed
Securities or (ii) the shares to be issued pursuant to any Other Subscription
Agreement.

 

i. Except for such matters as have not had and would not be reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or have a material adverse effect
on the Companys ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the issuance and sale of the Subscribed Securities, as of the date
hereof, there is no (i) suit, action, proceeding or arbitration before a
governmental authority or arbitrator pending, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened in writing against the Company or (ii) judgment, decree,
injunction, ruling or order of any governmental authority or
arbitrator outstanding against the Company.

j. The issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock are registered pursuant
to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
_Exchange Act_ "), and are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol "GIK" (it being understood that the trading symbol will be
changed in connection with the Transaction). There is no suit, action,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company by the New York Stock Exchange or the
Commission with respect to any intention by such entity to deregister the
shares of Common Stock or prohibit or terminate the listing of the shares of
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange. The Company has taken no action
that is designed to terminate the registration of the shares of Common Stock
under the Exchange Act.

k. Assuming the accuracy of Subscribers representations and warranties set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 4_ of this Subscription Agreement, no registration
under the Securities Act is required for the offer and sale of the Subscribed
Securities by the Company to Subscriber.

 

l. Neither the Company nor any person acting on its behalf has engaged or will
engage in any form of general solicitation or general advertising (within the
meaning of Regulation D) in connection with any offer or sale of the
Subscribed Securities.

 

m. Except for the Placement Agent (as defined below), no broker or finder is
entitled to any brokerage or finders fee or commission from the Company
solely in connection with the sale of the Subscribed Securities to Subscriber.

n. Except for such matters as have not had a Company Material Adverse Effect,
the Company is, and has been since its inception, in compliance with all state
and federal laws applicable to the conduct of its business. The Company has
not received any written, or to its knowledge, other communication from a
governmental entity that alleges that the Company is not in compliance with or
is in default or violation of any applicable law, except where such non-
compliance, default or violation would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Except for such
matters as have not had and would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the 

 



7

    

 aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, there is no (i) action, lawsuit, claim
or other proceeding, in each case by or before any governmental authority
pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company
or (ii) judgment, decree, injunction, ruling or order of any governmental
entity or arbitrator outstanding against the Company.

 

4\. _Subscriber Representations and Warranties_ _._ Subscriber represents and
warrants to the Company and the Placement Agent that: 

a. Subscriber (i) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and (ii) has the
requisite power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under
this Subscription Agreement.

 

b. This Subscription Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Subscriber, and assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the
same by the Company, this Subscription Agreement shall constitute the valid
and legally binding obligation of Subscriber, enforceable against Subscriber
in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting
creditors generally and by the availability of equitable remedies.

 

c. The execution and delivery of this Subscription Agreement, the purchase of
the Subscribed Securities and the compliance by Subscriber with all of the
provisions of this Subscription Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein will not conflict with or result in a breach
or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a
default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or
encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of Subscriber pursuant to the
terms of (i) any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease,
license or other agreement or instrument to which Subscriber is a party or by
which Subscriber is bound or to which any of the property or assets of
Subscriber is subject; (ii) the organizational documents of Subscriber; or
(iii) any statute or any judgment, order, rule or regulation of any court or
governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over
Subscriber or any of its properties that, in the case of clauses (i) and
(iii), would reasonably be expected to have a Subscriber Material Adverse
Effect. For purposes of this Subscription Agreement, a " _Subscriber Material
Adverse Effect_ " means an event, change, development, occurrence, condition
or effect with respect to Subscriber that would reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on Subscribers ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the purchase of the Subscribed
Securities.

 

d. Subscriber (i) is a "qualified institutional buyer" (as defined in Rule
144A under the Securities Act) or an institutional "accredited investor"
(within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities
Act) satisfying the applicable requirements set forth on Annex A hereto and an
"institutional account" as defined in FINRA Rule 4512(c), (ii) is acquiring
the Subscribed Securities only for its own account and not for the account of
others, or if Subscriber is subscribing for the Subscribed Securities as a
fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, each owner of such
account is a qualified institutional buyer and Subscriber has full investment
discretion with respect to each such account, and the full power and authority
to make the acknowledgements, representations and agreements herein on behalf
of each owner of each such account, and (iii) is not acquiring the Subscribed
Securities with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any
distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act (and has provided
the Company with the requested information on Annex A following the signature
page hereto). Subscriber is not an entity formed for the specific purpose of
acquiring the Subscribed Securities.

 



8

    

e. Subscriber understands that the Subscribed Securities are being offered in
a transaction not involving any public offering within the meaning of the
Securities Act and that the Subscribed Securities have not been registered
under the Securities Act. Subscriber understands that the Subscribed
Securities may not be resold, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of
by Subscriber absent an effective registration statement under the Securities
Act, except (i) to the Company or a subsidiary thereof, or (ii) pursuant to an
applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act, and, in each of cases (i) and (ii), in accordance with any applicable
securities laws of the applicable states and other jurisdictions of the United
States, and that any book-entry position or certificates representing the
Subscribed Securities shall contain a legend to such effect. Subscriber
understands and agrees that the Subscribed Securities will be subject to
transfer restrictions and, as a result of these transfer
restrictions, Subscriber may not be able to readily resell the Subscribed
Securities and may be required to bear the financial risk of an investment in
the Subscribed Securities for an indefinite period of time. Subscriber
understands that it has been advised to consult legal counsel prior to making
any offer, resale, pledge or transfer of any of the Subscribed Securities.

Each book entry for the Subscribed Securities shall contain a notation, and
each certificate (if any) evidencing the Notes and the Warrants shall be
stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend, in substantially the following
form:

 

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED
STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY
STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE
OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM.

 

f. Subscriber understands and agrees that Subscriber is purchasing the
Subscribed Securities directly from the Company. Subscriber further
acknowledges that there have not been, and Subscriber hereby agrees that it is
not relying on, any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made
to Subscriber by the Company, any other party to the Transaction or any other
person or entity (including the Placement Agent), expressly or by implication,
other than those representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Company set forth in this Subscription Agreement. Subscriber acknowledges that
certain information provided by the Company was based on projections, and
such projections were prepared based on assumptions and estimates that are
inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant
business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those contained in the projections.

g. In making its decision to purchase the Subscribed Securities, Subscriber
has relied solely upon independent investigation made by Subscriber.
Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that Subscriber has received such
information as Subscriber deems necessary in order to make an investment
decision with respect to the Subscribed Securities, including with respect to
the Company and the Transaction (including Lightning and its respective
subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Acquired Companies_ ")). Without limiting

 



9

    

 the generality of the foregoing, Subscriber acknowledges that Subscriber has
reviewed the Companys filings with the Commission. Subscriber represents and
agrees that Subscriber and Subscribers professional advisor(s), if any, have
had the full opportunity to ask such questions, receive such answers and
obtain such information as Subscriber and such undersigneds professional
advisor(s), if any, have deemed necessary to make an investment decision with
respect to the Subscribed Securities. Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that
none of Oppenheimer and Co. Inc. and Nomura Securities International, Inc., each
acting as a placement agent to the Company (the " _Placement Agent_ "), nor
any affiliate of the Placement Agent has provided Subscriber with any
information or advice with respect to the Subscribed Securities nor is such
information or advice necessary or desired. Neither the Placement Agent nor
any of its affiliates has made or makes any representation as to the Company
or the Acquired Companies or the quality or value of the Subscribed Securities
and the Placement Agent and any of its respective affiliates may
have acquired non-public information with respect to the Company or the
Acquired Companies which Subscriber agrees need not be provided to it. In
connection with the issuance of the Subscribed Securities to Subscriber,
neither the Placement Agent nor any of its affiliates has acted as a financial
advisor or fiduciary to Subscriber.

 

h. Subscriber became aware of this offering of the Subscribed Securities
solely by means of direct contact between Subscriber and the Company or by
means of contact from the Placement Agent, Lightning and/or their respective
advisors (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, bankers,
consultants and financial advisors), agents, control
persons, representatives, affiliates, directors, officers, managers, members,
and/or employees, and/or the representatives of such persons (such parties
referred to collectively as " _Representatives_ "). The Subscribed Securities
were offered to Subscriber solely by direct contact between Subscriber and
the Company, the Placement Agent, Lightning and/or their respective
Representatives. Subscriber acknowledges that it is not relying upon, and has
not relied upon, any statement, representation or warranty made by any person
or entity (including, without limitation, the Company, the Placement Agent,
Lightning and/or their respective Representatives), other than the
representations and warranties contained in this Subscription Agreement, in
making its investment or decision to invest in the Company. Subscriber did not
become aware of this offering of the Subscribed Securities, nor were the
Subscribed Securities offered to Subscriber, by any other means, and none of
the Company, the Placement Agent, Lightning or their respective
Representatives acted as investment advisor, broker or dealer to Subscriber.
Subscriber acknowledges that the Company represents and warrants that the
Subscribed Securities (i) were not offered by any form of general
solicitation or general advertising and (ii) are not being offered in a manner
involving a public offering under, or in a distribution in violation of, the
Securities Act, or any state securities laws.

i. Subscriber acknowledges that it is aware that there are substantial risks
incident to the purchase and ownership of the Subscribed Securities.
Subscriber has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters
as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the
Subscribed Securities, and Subscriber has had an opportunity to seek, and has
sought, such accounting, legal, business and tax advice as Subscriber has
considered necessary to make an informed investment decision.

 

j. Alone, or together with any professional advisor(s), Subscriber represents
and acknowledges that Subscriber has adequately analyzed and fully considered
the risks of an investment in the Subscribed Securities and determined that
the Subscribed Securities are a suitable investment for Subscriber and that
Subscriber is able at this time and in the foreseeable future to bear the
economic risk of a total loss of Subscribers investment in the Company.
Subscriber acknowledges specifically that a possibility of total loss exists.

 



10

    

k. Subscriber understands and agrees that no federal or state agency
has passed upon or endorsed the merits of the offering of the Subscribed
Securities or made any findings or determination as to the fairness of this
investment.

 

l. Subscriber is not (i) a person or entity named on the List of Specially
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons administered by the U.S. Treasury
Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control (" _OFAC_ ") or in any Executive
Order issued by the President of the United States and administered by OFAC,
or a person or entity prohibited by any OFAC sanctions program, or a person
or entity whose property and interests in property subject to U.S.
jurisdiction are otherwise blocked under any U.S. laws, Executive Orders or
regulations, (ii) a person or entity listed on the Sectoral Sanctions
Identifications (" _SSI_ ") List maintained by OFAC or otherwise determined by
OFAC to be subject to one or more of the Directives issued under Executive
Order 13662 of March 20, 2014, or on any other of the OFAC Consolidated
Sanctions Lists, (iii) an entity owned, directly or indirectly, individually
or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more persons described in
subsections (i) or (ii), (iv) a person or entity named on the U.S. Department
of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (" _BIS_ ") Denied Persons List,
Entity List, or Unverified List (" _BIS Lists_ ") (collectively with (i)
through (iv), a " _Restricted Person_ ") or (v) a non-U.S. shell bank or
providing banking services indirectly to a non-U.S. shell bank. Subscriber
agrees to provide law enforcement agencies, if requested thereby, such
records as required by applicable law, provided that Subscriber is permitted
to do so under applicable law. Subscriber represents that if it is a financial
institution subject to the Bank Secrecy Act (31 U.S.C. Section 5311 et seq.),
as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and its implementing regulations
(collectively, the " _BSA/PATRIOT Act_ "), that Subscriber maintains policies
and procedures reasonably designed to comply with applicable obligations
under the BSA/PATRIOT Act. Subscriber also represents that, to the extent
required, it maintains policies and procedures reasonably designed for the
screening of its investors against the OFAC and BIS sanctions
programs, including for Restricted Persons, and otherwise to ensure
compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws, statutes, and
regulations. Subscriber further represents and warrants that, to the extent
required, it maintains policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that the funds held by Subscriber and used to purchase the Subscribed
Securities were legally derived.

 

m. Subscriber does not have, as of the date hereof, and during the 30-day
period immediately prior to the date hereof such Subscriber has not entered
into, any "put equivalent position" as such term is defined in Rule 16a-1
under the Exchange Act or short sale positions with respect to the securities
of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Subscriber
that is a multi-managed investment vehicle whereby separate portfolio managers
manage separate portions of such Subscribers assets and the portfolio
managers have no direct knowledge of the investment decisions made by the
portfolio managers managing other portions of such Subscribers assets, the
representation set forth above shall only apply with respect to the portion
of assets managed by the portfolio manager that made the investment decision
to purchase the Subscribed Securities covered by this Agreement.

 



11

    

n. If Subscriber is an employee benefit plan that is subject to Title I
of ERISA, a plan, an individual retirement account or other arrangement that
is subject to Section 4975 of the Code or an employee benefit plan that is a
governmental plan (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), a church plan (as
defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA), a non-U.S. plan (as described in Section
4(b)(4) of ERISA) or other plan that is not subject to the foregoing but may
be subject to provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or
other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or an entity whose underlying
assets are considered to include "plan assets" of any such plan, account or
arrangement (each, a " _Plan_ ") subject to the fiduciary or prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, the Subscriber
represents and warrants that neither the Company, nor any of its respective
affiliates (the " _Transaction Parties_ ") has acted as the Plans fiduciary,
or has been relied on for advice, with respect to its decision to acquire and
hold the Subscribed Securities, and none of the Transaction Parties shall at
any time be relied upon as the Plans fiduciary with respect to any decision
to acquire, continue to hold or transfer the Subscribed Securities.

 

o. Subscriber at the Closing will have sufficient funds to pay the Purchase
Price pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2(b)_ of this Subscription Agreement.

p. No disclosure or offering document has been prepared by the Placement
Agent in connection with the offer and sale of the Subscribed Securities. The
Placement Agent and each of its directors, officers, employees,
representatives and controlling persons have made no independent
investigation with respect to the Company or the Subscribed Securities or the
accuracy, completeness or adequacy of any information supplied to the
Subscriber by the Company. In connection with the issue and purchase of the
Common Stock, the Placement Agent has not acted as the Subscribers financial
advisor or fiduciary.

q. Subscriber agrees that, notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _ 8(j)_ of this
Subscription Agreement, the Placement Agent may rely upon the representations
and warranties made by Subscriber to the Company in this Subscription
Agreement.

 

5\. _Registration of Subscribed Securities_.

 

a. The Company agrees that, within forty five (45) calendar days after the
consummation of the Transaction (the " _Filing Deadline_ "), the Company will
file with the Commission (at the Companys sole cost and expense) a
registration statement (the " _Registration Statement_ ") registering the
resale of the (I) shares of Common Stock issuable upon (x) conversion of the
Subscribed Notes and (y) exercise of the Subscribed Warrants and (II) the
Warrants (together, the " _Registrable Securities_ "), and the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but no
later than the 60th calendar day (or 90th calendar day if the Commission
notifies the Company that it will "review" the Registration Statement)
following the Filing Deadline (such date, the " _Effectiveness Date_
"); provided, however, that the Companys obligations to include the
Registrable Securities in the Registration Statement are contingent upon the
undersigned furnishing in writing to the Company such information regarding
the undersigned, the securities of the Company held by the undersigned and
the intended method of disposition of the Registrable Securities as shall be
reasonably requested by the Company to effect the registration of the
Registrable Securities, and shall execute such documents in connection with
such registration as the Company may reasonably request that are customary of
a selling stockholder in similar situations. The Company will provide a draft
of the Registration Statement to the Subscriber for review at least three (3)
business days in advance of filing the Registration

 



12

    

 Statement. In no event shall the Subscriber be identified as a statutory
underwriter in the Registration Statement unless requested by the Commission;
_provided_ , that if the Commission requests that the Subscriber be
identified as a statutory underwriter in the Registration Statement, the
Subscriber will have an opportunity to withdraw from the Registration
Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Commission prevents
the Company from including any or all of the shares proposed to be registered
under the Registration Statement due to limitations on the use of Rule 415 of
the Securities Act for the resale of the Registrable Securities by the
applicable shareholders or otherwise, such Registration Statement shall
register for resale such number of Registrable Securities which is equal to
the maximum number of Registrable Securities as is permitted by the SEC. In
such event, the number of Registrable Securities to be registered for each
selling shareholder named in the Registration Statement shall be reduced pro
rata among all such selling shareholders. The Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the continuous effectiveness
of the Registration Statement, and to be supplemented and amended to the
extent necessary to ensure that such Registration Statement is available or,
if not available, that another registration statement is available for the
resale of the Registrable Securities, until the earliest of (i) the date on
which the Registrable Securities may be resold without volume or manner of
sale limitations pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act,
(ii) the date on which such Registrable Securities have actually been sold
and (iii) the date which is three years after the Closing. For purposes of
clarification, any failure by the Company to file the Registration Statement
by the Filing Deadline or to effect such Registration Statement by the
Effectiveness Date shall not otherwise relieve the Company of its obligations
to file or effect the Registration Statement set forth in this _Section_ __ _
5_.

 

b. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Subscription Agreement,
the Company shall be entitled to delay or postpone the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, and from time to time to require any Subscriber not to
sell under the Registration Statement or to suspend the effectiveness thereof,
if the negotiation or consummation of a transaction by the Company or its
subsidiaries is pending or an event has occurred, which negotiation,
consummation or event, the Companys board of directors reasonably believes,
upon the advice of legal counsel, would require additional disclosure by the
Company in the Registration Statement of material information that the
Company has a bona fide business purpose for keeping confidential and the non-
disclosure of which in the Registration Statement would be expected, in
the reasonable determination of the Companys board of directors, upon the
advice of legal counsel, to cause the Registration Statement to fail to comply
with applicable disclosure requirements (each such circumstance, a "
_Suspension Event_ "); provided, however, that the Company may not delay or
suspend the Registration Statement on more than two occasions or for more than
sixty (60) consecutive calendar days, or more than ninety (90) total calendar
days, in each case during any twelve-month period. Upon receipt of any
written notice from the Company of the happening of any Suspension Event
(which notice shall not contain material non-public information) during the
period that the Registration Statement is effective or if as a result of a
Suspension Event the Registration Statement or related prospectus contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made (in the case of the
prospectus) not misleading, Subscriber agrees that (i) it will immediately
discontinue offers and sales of the Registrable Securities under the
Registration Statement (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, sales conducted
pursuant to Rule 144) until such Subscriber receives copies of a supplemental
or amended prospectus (which the Company agrees to promptly prepare) that
corrects the misstatement(s) or

 



13

    

 omission(s) referred to above and receives notice that any post-effective
amendment has become effective or unless otherwise notified by the Company
that it may resume such offers and sales, and (ii) it will maintain the
confidentiality of any information included in such written notice delivered
by the Company unless otherwise required by law or subpoena. If so directed by
the Company, Subscriber will deliver to the Company or, in such Subscribers
sole discretion destroy, all copies of the prospectus covering the Registrable
Securities in such Subscribers possession; provided, however, that this
obligation to deliver or destroy all copies of the prospectus covering the
Registrable Securities shall not apply (i) to the extent such Subscriber is
required to retain a copy of such prospectus (a) in order to comply with
applicable legal, regulatory, self-regulatory or professional requirements
or (b) in accordance with a bona fide pre-existing document retention policy
or (ii) to copies stored electronically on archival servers as a result of
automatic data back-up.

c. The Company shall, notwithstanding any termination of this Subscription
Agreement, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Subscriber (to the extent a
seller under the Registration Statement), and its officers, directors and
agents, and each person who controls such Subscriber (within the meaning
of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys fees) and expenses (collectively, " _Losses_ "), as
incurred, that arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any
prospectus included in the Registration Statement or any form of prospectus
or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or
arising out of or relating to any omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of any prospectus or form of prospectus or
supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were made)
not misleading, or (ii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of
the Securities Act, Exchange Act or any state securities law or any rule or
regulation thereunder, in connection with the performance of its obligations
under this _Section_ __ _ 5_, except to the extent, but only to the extent,
that such untrue statements, alleged untrue statements, omissions or alleged
omissions are based upon information regarding such Subscriber furnished in
writing to the Company by such Subscriber expressly for use therein or such
Subscriber has omitted a material fact from such information or otherwise
violated the Securities Act, Exchange Act or any state securities law or any
rule or regulation thereunder; provided, however, that the
indemnification contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5_ shall not apply to
amounts paid in settlement of any Losses if such settlement is effected
without the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), nor shall the Company be liable for any
Losses to the extent they arise out of or are based upon a violation which
occurs (A) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished by a Subscriber, (B) in connection with any failure of such person
to deliver or cause to be delivered a prospectus made available by the Company
in a timely manner, (C) as a result of offers or sales effected by or on
behalf of any person by means of a freewriting prospectus (as defined in Rule
405) that was not authorized in writing by the Company, or (D) in connection
with any offers or sales effected by or on behalf of a Subscriber in violation
of _Section_ __ _ 5(b)_ of this Subscription Agreement. The Company shall
notify such Subscriber promptly of the institution, threat or assertion of any
proceeding arising from or in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 5_ of which the Company is aware. Such indemnity shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of an indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of the
Registrable Securities by such Subscriber.

 



14

    

d. If the total number of shares of Common Stock that the Subscriber and
any other person(s) intend to include in an underwritten offering exceeds the
number of shares of Common Stock that can be sold in an underwritten offering
without being likely to have an adverse effect on the price, timing or
distribution of shares of the Common Stock offered or the market for the
shares of Common Stock, then the shares of Common Stock to be included in such
offering shall include the number of shares of Common Stock that the managing
underwriter of the offering advises the Company can be sold without having
such adverse effect, with such number to be allocated (i) first, to the
Company or other party or parties requesting or initiating such registration
or to any other holder of securities of the Company having rights of
registration pursuant to an existing registration rights agreement and (ii)
second, by the Subscriber who has requested participation in such underwritten
offering and by the other holders of shares of Common Stock with
registration rights entitling them to participate in such underwritten
offering, allocated among the Subscriber and other holders pro rata on the
basis of the number of shares of Common Stock proposed to be sold by each
applicable holder in such underwritten offering (based, for each such
participant, on the percentage derived by dividing (x) the number of shares of
Common Stock proposed to be sold by such participant in such underwritten
offering by (y) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock proposed to be
sold by all participants in such underwritten offering) or in such manner as
they may agree.

 

e. Subscriber shall, severally and not jointly with the Other Subscribers,
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers, agents and
employees, and each person who controls the Company (within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against all Losses, as
incurred, arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, any prospectus
included in the Registration Statement, or any form of prospectus, or in any
amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising
out of or relating to any omission or alleged omission of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in
the case of any prospectus, or any form of prospectus or supplement thereto,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading to
the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statements or omissions
are based upon information regarding such Subscriber furnished in writing to
the Company by such Subscriber expressly for use therein; provided, however,
that the indemnification contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5_ shall not apply
to amounts paid in settlement of any Losses if such settlement is effected
without the consent of such Subscriber (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In no event shall the
liability of any Subscriber be greater in amount than the dollar amount of
the net proceeds received by such Subscriber upon the sale of the Registrable
Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. Subscriber shall
notify the Company promptly of the institution, threat or assertion of
any proceeding arising from or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5_ of which such Subscriber is aware.
Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of an indemnified party and shall survive
the transfer of the Registrable Securities by such Subscriber.

6\. _Termination_. This Subscription Agreement shall terminate and be void and
of no further force and effect, and all rights and obligations of the parties
hereunder shall terminate without any further liability on the part of any
party in respect thereof, upon the earlier to occur of (a) such date and time
as the Transaction Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, (b)
upon the mutual written agreement of the Company and the Subscriber to
terminate this Subscription Agreement, (c) if, on the Closing Date of the
Transaction, any of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2_
of this Subscription Agreement have not been satisfied as of the time required
hereunder to be so satisfied or waived (to the extent a valid waiver is
capable of being issued) by the party entitled to grant such waiver and, as a
result thereof, the transactions contemplated by this Subscription Agreement
are not consummated, or (d) June 30, 2021 (the " _Outside Date_ "); provided,
that nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for any willful
breach hereof (including, for the avoidance of doubt, a Subscribers willful
breach of _Section_ __ _ 2(c)_ of this Subscription Agreement with respect to
its representations, warranties and covenants as of the date of the Closing)
prior to the time of termination, and each party will be entitled to any
remedies at law or in equity to recover losses, liabilities or damages arising
from such breach. The Company shall notify Subscriber of the termination of
the Transaction Agreement promptly after the termination thereof.

7\. _Trust Account Waiver_. Subscriber hereby acknowledges that the Company
has established a trust account (the " _Trust Account_ ") containing the
proceeds of its initial public offering (the " _IPO_ ") and from certain
private placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO (including interest
accrued from time to time thereon) for the benefit of the Companys public
stockholders and certain other parties (including the underwriters of the
IPO). For and in consideration of the Company entering into this Subscription
Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Subscriber hereby (i) agrees
that it does not now and shall not at any time hereafter have any right,
title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any assets held in the Trust
Account, and shall not make any claim against the Trust Account, regardless of
whether such claim arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in
any way to this Subscription Agreement or any other matter, and regardless of
whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory
of legal liability (any and all such claims are collectively referred to
hereafter as the " _Released Claims_ "), (ii) irrevocably waives any Released
Claims that it may have against the Trust Account now or in the future as a
result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with
the Company, and (iii) will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for
any reason whatsoever; provided however, that nothing in this _Section_ __ _
7_ shall be deemed to limit any Subscribers right to distributions from the
Trust Account in accordance with the Companys amended and restated
certificate of incorporation in respect of any redemptions by Subscriber of
its shares of public Common Stock of the Company acquired by any means other
than pursuant to this Subscription Agreement. Subscriber agrees not to seek
recourse or make or bring any action, suit, claim or other proceeding against
the Trust Account as a result of, or arising out of, this Subscription
Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the Subscribed Securities
regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any
other theory of legal liability. Each Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that
it shall not have any redemption rights with respect to the Subscribed
Securities pursuant to the Companys organizational documents in connection
with the Transaction or any other business combination, any subsequent
liquidation of the Trust Account, the Company or otherwise. In the
event Subscriber has any claim against the Company as a result of, or arising
out of, this Subscription Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or
the Subscribed Securities, it shall pursue such claim solely against the
Company and its assets outside the Trust Account and not against the Trust
Account or any monies or other assets in the Trust Account.

8\. _Miscellaneous_.

the foregoing, Subscriber may assign its rights and obligations under this
Subscription Agreement to one or more of its affiliates (including other
investment funds or accounts managed or advised by the investment manager who
acts on behalf of the Subscriber) or, with the Companys prior written
consent, to another person, provided that no such assignment shall
relieve Subscriber of its obligations hereunder if any such assignee fails to
perform such obligations, unless the Company has given its prior written
consent to such relief.

 

g. All the agreements, representations and warranties made by each party
hereto in this Subscription Agreement shall survive the Closing.

 



17

    

h. The Company may request from Subscriber such additional information as the
Company may reasonably deem necessary to evaluate the eligibility of

by Subscriber confidential.

 

i. This Subscription Agreement may not be amended, modified, waived or
terminated except by an instrument in writing, signed by the party against

provided, that _Section_ __ _ 4_, this _Section_ __ _ 8(i)_ and _Section_ __
_ 8(k)_ of this Subscription Agreement may not be amended, terminated or
waived in a manner that is material and adverse to the Placement Agent without
the written consent of the Placement Agent.

 

j. This Subscription Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, and
supersedes all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties, both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof, except that any confidentiality agreement with respect

k. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Subscription Agreement shall be
binding upon, and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their heirs,

acknowledgments contained herein shall be deemed to be made by, and be
binding upon, such heirs, executors, administrators, successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. The parties hereto agree that the
Placement Agent is an express third-party beneficiary of its express rights
in  _Section_ __ _ 3_, _Section_ __ _ 4_, _Section_ __ _ 8(i)_ and this
_Section_ __ _ 8(k)_ of this Subscription Agreement. Each of the parties
hereto shall be entitled to seek and obtain equitable relief, without proof
of actual damages, including an injunction or injunctions or order for
specific performance to prevent breaches of this Subscription Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Subscription Agreement

Each party hereto further agrees that the none of the parties hereto or the
Placement Agent shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or

or posting of any such bond or similar instrument

l. If any provision of this Subscription Agreement shall be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable, the validity, legality or enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Subscription Agreement shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby and shall continue in full force and effect.

 

m. This Subscription Agreement may be executed and delivered in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic mail or in .pdf) and by
different parties in separate counterparts, with the same effect as if all
parties hereto had signed the same document. All counterparts so executed and
delivered shall be construed together and shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

 



18

    

n. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Subscription Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction

law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OR RELATED TO THIS
SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR OTHER LITIGATION OF ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY AGAINST ANY
OTHER PARTY OR ANY AFFILIATE OF ANY OTHER SUCH PARTY, WHETHER WITH RESPECT TO
CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY SUCH
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE TRIED BY A COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY.
WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THEIR
RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS WAIVED BY OPERATION OF THIS SECTION AS
TO ANY ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER PROCEEDING WHICH SEEKS, IN WHOLE OR IN
PART, TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS SUBSCRIPTION
AGREEMENT OR ANY PROVISION HEREOF. THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT
AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS SUBSCRIPTION
AGREEMENT.

q. The parties agree that all disputes, legal actions, suits and proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Subscription Agreement must be brought
exclusively in the state courts of New York or in the federal courts located
in the state and county of New York (collectively the " _Designated Courts_
"). Each party hereby consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Designated Courts. No legal action, suit or proceeding with respect to
this subscription agreement may be brought in any other forum. Each party
hereby irrevocably waives all claims of immunity from jurisdiction and any
objection which such party may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any suit, action or proceeding in any Designated Court, including any right
to object on the basis that any dispute, action, suit or proceeding brought in
the Designated Courts has been brought in an improper or inconvenient forum or
venue. Each of the parties also agrees that delivery of any process, summons,
notice or document to a party hereof in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 8(a)_
of this Subscription Agreement shall be effective service of process for any
action, suit or proceeding in a Designated Court with respect to any matters

r. This Subscription Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim,
action, suit or other legal proceeding based upon, arising out of, or related

are expressly named as parties

 



19

    

 hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth
herein with respect to such party. No past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member, partner, stockholder,
affiliate, agent, attorney or other representative of any party hereto or of
any affiliate of any party hereto, or any of their successors or permitted
assigns, shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of
any party hereto under this Subscription Agreement or for any claim, action,
suit or other legal proceeding based on, in respect of or by reason of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

s. The Company shall, by 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first
(1st) business day immediately following the date of this Subscription
Agreement, issue one or more press releases or file with the Commission a
Current Report on Form 8-K (collectively, the " _Disclosure Document_ ")
disclosing, to the extent not previously publicly disclosed, all material
terms of the transactions contemplated hereby (and by the Other Subscription
Agreements), the Transaction and any other material, nonpublic
information that the Company has provided to Subscriber at any time prior to
the filing of the Disclosure Document. From and after the issuance of the
Disclosure Document, Subscriber shall not be in possession of any
material, non-public information received from the Company or any of its
officers, directors or employees or the Placement Agent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not publicly disclose the name of Subscriber or
any affiliate or investment advisor of Subscriber, or include the name of
Subscriber or any affiliate or investment advisor of Subscriber in any press
release or in any filing with the Commission or any regulatory agency or
trading market, without the prior written consent (including by e-mail) of
Subscriber, except as required by the federal securities laws, rules or
regulations and to the extent such disclosure is required by other laws,
rules or regulations, at the request of the staff of the Commission or
regulatory agency or under New York Stock Exchange regulations, in which case
the Company shall provide Subscriber with prior written notice (including by
e-mail) of such permitted disclosure, and shall reasonably consult with
Subscriber regarding such disclosure.

 

t. The obligations of Subscriber under this Subscription Agreement are several
and not joint with the obligations of any Other Subscriber or any other
investor under the Other Subscription Agreements, and Subscriber shall not be
responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any Other
Subscriber under this Subscription Agreement or any other investor under the
Other Subscription Agreements. The decision of Subscriber to purchase
Subscribed Securities pursuant to this Subscription Agreement has been made by
Subscriber independently of any Other Subscriber or any other investor and
independently of any information, materials, statements or opinions as to the
business, affairs, operations, assets, properties, liabilities, results of
operations, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries which may have been made or given by any Other
Subscriber or investor or by any agent or employee of any Other Subscriber or
investor, and neither Subscriber nor any of its agents or employees shall have
any liability to any Other Subscriber or investor (or any other person)
relating to or arising from any such information, materials, statements or
opinions. Nothing contained herein or in any Other Subscription Agreement, and
no action taken by Subscriber or investor pursuant hereto or thereto, shall
be deemed to constitute the Subscriber and other investors as a partnership,
an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a
presumption that the Subscriber and other investors are in any way acting in
concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions
contemplated by the this Subscription Agreement and the Other Subscription
Agreements. Subscriber acknowledges that no Other Subscriber has acted as
agent for the Subscriber in connection with making its investment hereunder
and no Other Subscriber will be acting

 



20

    

 as agent of the Subscriber in connection with monitoring its investment in
the Subscribed Securities or enforcing its rights under this Subscription
Agreement. Subscriber shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce
its rights, including without limitation the rights arising out of this
Subscription Agreement, and it shall not be necessary for any Other Subscriber
or investor to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such
purpose.

Trustee, the Note Registrar or any co-Note Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be
accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Trustee or Note Registrar and duly executed, by the
Holder thereof or its attorney-in-fact duly authorized in writing.

 

No service charge shall be imposed on a Holder by the Company, the Trustee,
the Note Registrar, any co-Note Registrar or the Paying Agent for any
exchange or registration of transfer of Notes, but the Company may require a
Holder to pay a sum sufficient to cover any documentary, stamp or similar
issue or transfer tax required in connection therewith as a result of the
name of the Holder of new Notes issued upon such exchange or registration of
transfer being different from the name of the Holder of the old Notes
surrendered for exchange or registration of transfer.

None of the Company, the Trustee, the Note Registrar or any co-Note Registrar
shall be required to exchange or register a transfer of (i) any Notes
surrendered for conversion or, if a portion of any Note is surrendered for
conversion, such portion thereof surrendered for conversion or (ii) any Notes,
or a portion of any Note, surrendered for repurchase (and not withdrawn) in
accordance with Article 15\.

All Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes in
accordance with this Indenture shall be the valid obligations of the Company,
evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this
Indenture as the Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or
exchange.

(b) So long as the Notes are eligible for book-entry settlement with the
Depositary, unless otherwise required by law, subject to the fourth paragraph
from the end of Section 2.05(c), all Notes shall be represented by one or more
Notes in global form (each, a "Global Note") registered in the name of the
Depositary or the nominee of the Depositary. The transfer and exchange of
beneficial interests in a Global Note that does not involve the issuance of a
Physical Note shall be effected through the Depositary (but not the Trustee or
the Custodian) in accordance with this Indenture (including the restrictions
on transfer set forth herein) and the Applicable Procedures.

(c) Every Note that bears or is required under this Section 2.05(c) to bear
the legend set forth in this Section 2.05(c) (together with any Common Stock
issued upon conversion of the Notes that is required to bear the legend set
forth in Section 2.05(d), collectively, the "Restricted Securities") shall be
subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section 2.05(c)
(including the legend set forth below), unless such restrictions on transfer
shall be eliminated or otherwise waived by written consent of the Company,
and the Holder of each such Restricted Security, by such Holders acceptance
thereof, agrees to be bound by all such restrictions on transfer. As used in
this Section 2.05(c) and Section 2.05(c), the term "transfer" encompasses any
sale, pledge, transfer or other disposition whatsoever of any Restricted
Security.

(d) Each Global Note shall bear a legend in substantially the following form
(the "Restrictive Legend") (or any similar legend, not inconsistent with this
Indenture, required by the Depositary for such Global Note):

 

THIS SECURITY AND THE COMMON STOCK, IF ANY, ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION OF THIS
SECURITY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE. BY ITS
ACQUISITION HEREOF OR OF A BENEFICIAL INTEREST HEREIN, THE ACQUIRER: 

(1) REPRESENTS THAT IT AND ANY ACCOUNT FOR WHICH IT IS ACTING IS A "QUALIFIED
INSTITUTIONAL BUYER" (WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT) AND THAT IT EXERCISES SOLE INVESTMENT DISCRETION WITH RESPECT TO EACH
SUCH ACCOUNT, AND

 

(2) AGREES FOR THE BENEFIT OF [LIGHTNING EMOTORS, INC.] (THE "COMPANY") THAT
IT WILL NOT OFFER, SELL, PLEDGE OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER THIS SECURITY OR ANY
BENEFICIAL INTEREST HEREIN PRIOR TO THE DATE THAT IS THE LATER OF (X) ONE YEAR
AFTER THE LAST ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE HEREOF OR SUCH SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME AS
PERMITTED BY RULE 144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR ANY SUCCESSOR PROVISION
THERETO AND (Y) SUCH LATER DATE, IF ANY, AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
EXCEPT:

(A) TO THE COMPANY OR ANY SUBSIDIARY THEREOF, OR

(B) PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT THAT HAS BECOME EFFECTIVE UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT AND IS EFFECTIVE AT THE TIME OF SUCH TRANSFER, OR

(C) TO A PERSON THAT YOU REASONABLY BELIEVE TO BE A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL
BUYER IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, OR

(D) PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION PROVIDED BY RULE 144 UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OR ANY OTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT.

 

PRIOR TO THE REGISTRATION OF ANY TRANSFER IN ACCORDANCE WITH CLAUSE (2)(D)
ABOVE, THE COMPANY AND THE TRUSTEE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE THE DELIVERY
OF SUCH LEGAL OPINIONS, CERTIFICATIONS OR OTHER EVIDENCE AS MAY REASONABLY BE
REQUIRED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THAT THE PROPOSED TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN
COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS.
NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE AS TO THE AVAILABILITY OF ANY EXEMPTION FROM THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT.

NO AFFILIATE (AS DEFINED IN RULE 144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT) OF THE COMPANY
OR PERSON THAT HAS BEEN AN AFFILIATE (AS DEFINED IN RULE 144 UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT) OF THE COMPANY DURING THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THREE MONTHS
MAY PURCHASE, OTHERWISE ACQUIRE OR HOLD THIS SECURITY OR A BENEFICIAL
INTEREST HEREIN.

 



17

    

Any Note (or security issued in exchange or substitution therefor) (i) as to
which such restrictions on transfer shall have expired in accordance with
their terms or (ii) that has been sold pursuant to the exemption from
registration provided by Rule 144 or any similar provision then in force under
the Securities Act, may, upon surrender of such Note for exchange to the Note
Registrar in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.05, be exchanged
for a new Note or Notes, of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, which
shall not bear the Restrictive Legend required by this Section 2.05(c) and
shall not be assigned (or deemed assigned) a restricted CUSIP number. The
Restrictive Legend set forth above and affixed on any Note will be deemed, in
accordance with the terms of the certificate representing such Note, to be
removed therefrom upon the Companys delivery to the Trustee of written notice
to such effect, without further action by the Company, the Trustee, the
Holder(s) thereof or any other Person; at such time, such Note will be deemed
to be assigned an unrestricted CUSIP number as provided in the certificate
representing such Note, it being understood that the Depositary of any Global
Note may require a mandatory exchange or other process to cause such Global
Note to be identified by an unrestricted CUSIP number in the facilities of
such Depositary. Without limiting the generality of any other provision of
this Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to receive an instruction letter
from the Company before taking any action with respect to effecting any such
mandatory exchange or other process. The Company and the Trustee reserve the
right to require the delivery of such legal opinions, certifications or other
evidence as may reasonably be required in order to determine that any
proposed transfer of any Note is being made in compliance with the Securities
Act and applicable state securities laws.

 

The Company shall be entitled to instruct the Custodian in writing to so
surrender any Global Note as to which any of the conditions set forth in
clause (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence have been satisfied,
and, upon such instruction, the Custodian shall so surrender such Global Note
for exchange; and any new Global Note so exchanged therefor shall not bear
the Restrictive Legend specified in this Section 2.05(c) and shall not be
assigned (or deemed assigned) a restricted CUSIP number.

 

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture (other than the
provisions set forth in this Section 2.05(c)), a Global Note may not be
transferred as a whole or in part except (i) by the Depositary to a nominee of
the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another
nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to
a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary and (ii) for
exchange of a Global Note or a portion thereof for one or more Physical Notes
in accordance with the second immediately succeeding paragraph.

 

The Depositary shall be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act.
The Company initially appoints The Depository Trust Company to act as
Depositary with respect to each Global Note. Initially, each Global Note shall
be issued to the Depositary, registered in the name of Cede and Co., as the
nominee of the Depositary, and deposited with the Trustee as custodian
for Cede and Co.

If (i) the Depositary notifies the Company at any time that the Depositary is
unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes and a
successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days, (ii) the Depositary
ceases to be registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act and a
successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days or (iii) an Event of
Default with respect to the Notes has occurred and is continuing and a
beneficial owner of any Note requests that its beneficial interest therein be
issued as a Physical Note, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee,
upon receipt of an Officers Certificate and a Company Order for the
authentication and delivery of Notes, shall authenticate and deliver (x) in
the case of clause (iii), a Physical Note to such beneficial owner in a
principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Note corresponding to
such beneficial owners beneficial interest and (y) in the case of clause (i)
or (ii), Physical Notes to each beneficial owner of the related Global Notes
(or a portion thereof) in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
aggregate principal amount of such Global Notes in exchange for such Global
Notes, and upon delivery of the Global Notes to the Trustee such Global Notes
shall be canceled.

 



18

    

Physical Notes issued in exchange for all or a part of the Global Note
pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) shall be registered in such names and in
such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from
its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, or, in the case of clause
(iii) of the immediately preceding paragraph, the relevant beneficial owner,
shall instruct the Trustee. Upon execution and authentication, the Trustee
shall deliver such Physical Notes to the Persons in whose names such Physical
Notes are so registered.

 

At such time as all interests in a Global Note have been converted, canceled,
repurchased or transferred, such Global Note shall be, upon receipt thereof,
canceled by the Trustee in accordance with standing procedures and existing
instructions between the Depositary and the Custodian. At any time prior to
such cancellation, if any interest in a Global Note is exchanged for
Physical Notes, converted, canceled, repurchased or transferred to a
transferee who receives Physical Notes therefor or any Physical Note is
exchanged or transferred for part of such Global Note, the principal amount of
such Global Note shall, in accordance with the standing procedures and
instructions existing between the Depositary and the Custodian, be
appropriately reduced or increased, as the case may be, and an endorsement
shall be made on such Global Note, by the Trustee or the Custodian, at
the direction of the Trustee, to reflect such reduction or increase.

None of the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Conversion Agent or
any other agent of the Company or the Trustee shall have any responsibility or
liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on
account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Note or maintaining,
supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership
interests.

Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall have any responsibility or
liability for any act or omission of the Depositary. All notices and
communications to be given to the Holders and all payments to be made to
Holders in respect of the Notes shall be given or made only to, or upon the
order of, the registered Holder(s) (which shall be the Depositary or its
nominee in the case of a Global Note).

The rights of beneficial owners in any Global Note shall be exercised only
through the Depositary subject to the Applicable Procedures of the Depositary.
The Trustee may rely and shall be fully protected in relying upon information
furnished by the Depositary with respect to its members, participants and any
beneficial owners.

(d) Any stock certificate representing Common Stock issued upon conversion of
a Note shall bear a legend in substantially the following form (unless such
Common Stock has been transferred pursuant to a registration statement that
has become or been declared effective under the Securities Act and that
continues to be effective at the time of such transfer, or pursuant to the
exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 or any similar provision then
in force under the Securities Act, or such Common Stock has been issued upon
conversion of a Note that has transferred pursuant to a registration
statement that has become or been declared effective under the Securities Act
and that continues to be effective at the time of such transfer, or pursuant
to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 or any similar
provision then in force under the Securities Act, or unless otherwise agreed
by the Company with written notice thereof to the Trustee and any transfer
agent for the Common Stock):

 

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE. BY ITS
ACQUISITION HEREOF OR OF A BENEFICIAL INTEREST HEREIN, THE ACQUIRER:

 

(1) REPRESENTS THAT IT AND ANY ACCOUNT FOR WHICH IT IS ACTING IS A "QUALIFIED
INSTITUTIONAL BUYER" (WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT) AND THAT IT EXERCISES SOLE INVESTMENT DISCRETION WITH RESPECT TO EACH
SUCH ACCOUNT, AND

 



19

    

(2) AGREES FOR THE BENEFIT OF [LIGHTNING EMOTORS, INC.] (THE "COMPANY") THAT
IT WILL NOT OFFER, SELL, PLEDGE OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER THIS SECURITY OR ANY
BENEFICIAL INTEREST HEREIN PRIOR TO THE DATE THAT IS THE LATER OF (X) ONE YEAR
AFTER THE LAST ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE OF THE SERIES OF NOTES UPON THE CONVERSION
OF WHICH THIS SECURITY WAS ISSUED OR SUCH SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME AS PERMITTED
BY RULE 144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR ANY SUCCESSOR PROVISION THERETO AND
(Y) SUCH LATER DATE, IF ANY, AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EXCEPT:

(A) TO THE COMPANY OR ANY SUBSIDIARY THEREOF, OR

 

(B) PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT THAT HAS BECOME EFFECTIVE UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT AND IS EFFECTIVE AT THE TIME OF SUCH TRANSFER, OR

(C) TO A PERSON THAT YOU REASONABLY BELIEVE TO BE A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL
BUYER IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, OR

(D) PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION PROVIDED BY RULE 144 UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OR ANY OTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT.

PRIOR TO THE REGISTRATION OF ANY TRANSFER IN ACCORDANCE WITH CLAUSE (2)(D)
ABOVE, THE COMPANY AND THE TRANSFER AGENT FOR THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK
RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE THE DELIVERY OF SUCH LEGAL OPINIONS,
CERTIFICATIONS OR OTHER EVIDENCE AS MAY REASONABLY BE REQUIRED IN ORDER FOR
THE COMPANY TO DETERMINE THAT THE PROPOSED TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN
COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. NO
REPRESENTATION IS MADE AS TO THE AVAILABILITY OF ANY EXEMPTION FROM
THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT.

Any such Common Stock (i) as to which such restrictions on transfer shall
have expired in accordance with their terms, (ii) that has been transferred
pursuant to a registration statement that has become or been declared
effective under the Securities Act and that continues to be effective at the
time of such transfer or (iii) that has been sold pursuant to the exemption
from registration provided by Rule 144 or any similar provision then in force
under the Securities Act, may, upon surrender of the certificates representing
such shares of Common Stock for exchange in accordance with the procedures of
the transfer agent for the Common Stock, be exchanged for a new certificate or
certificates for a like aggregate number of shares of Common Stock, which
shall not bear the restrictive legend required by this Section 2.05(d).

(e) Any Note or Common Stock issued upon conversion or exchange of a Note that
is repurchased or owned by any Affiliate of the Company (or any Person who
was an Affiliate of the Company at any time during the three months
immediately preceding) may not be resold by such Affiliate (or such Person, as
the case may be) unless registered under the Securities Act or resold
pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act in a transaction that results in such Note or Common Stock, as the case
may be, no longer being a "restricted security" (as defined under Rule 144).

 



20

    

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the
Trustee nor the Note Registrar shall be responsible for ascertaining whether
any transfer complies with the registration provisions of, or exemptions from,
the Securities Act, applicable state securities laws or other applicable law.

 

Section 2.06 _Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes_. In case any Note
shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company in its
discretion may execute, and upon receipt of a Company Order, the Trustee or an
authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver,
a new Note, bearing a registration number not contemporaneously outstanding,
in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Note, or in lieu of and in
substitution for the Note so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the
applicant for a substituted Note shall furnish to the Company, to the Trustee
and, if applicable, to such authenticating agent such security or indemnity
as may be required by them to save each of them harmless from any loss,
liability, cost or expense caused by or connected with such substitution, and,
in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish
to the Company, to the Trustee and, if applicable, to such authenticating
agent evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such
Note and of the ownership thereof.

 

The Trustee or such authenticating agent may authenticate any such substituted
Note and deliver the same upon the receipt of such security or indemnity as
the Trustee, the Company and, if applicable, such authenticating agent may
require. No service charge shall be imposed by the Company, the Trustee, the
Note Registrar, any co-Note Registrar or the Paying Agent upon the issuance
of any substitute Note, but the Company may require a Holder to pay a sum
sufficient to cover any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax
required in connection therewith as a result of the name of the Holder of the
new substitute Note being different from the name of the Holder of the old
Note that became mutilated or was destroyed, lost or stolen. In case any Note
that has matured or is about to mature or has been surrendered for
required repurchase or is about to be converted in accordance with Article 14
shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, in
its sole discretion, instead of issuing a substitute Note, pay or authorize
the payment of or convert or authorize the conversion of the same (without
surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Note), as the case may be,
if the applicant for such payment or conversion shall furnish to the Company,
to the Trustee and, if applicable, to such authenticating agent such security
or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless for any
loss, liability, cost or expense caused by or connected with such
substitution, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence
satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and, if applicable, any Paying Agent
or Conversion Agent of the destruction, loss or theft of such Note and of the
ownership thereof.

 

Every substitute Note issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.06
by virtue of the fact that any Note is destroyed, lost or stolen shall
constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not
the destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be found at any time, and shall be
entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations
set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all
other Notes duly issued hereunder. To the extent permitted by law, all Notes
shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing
provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement, payment, conversion
or repurchase of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and shall preclude
any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute
existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the
replacement, payment, conversion or repurchase of negotiable instruments or
other securities without their surrender.

 



21

    

Section 2.07 _Temporary Notes_. Pending the preparation of Physical Notes,
the Company may execute and the Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed
by the Trustee shall, upon receipt of a Company Order, authenticate and
deliver temporary Notes (printed or lithographed). Temporary Notes shall be
issuable in any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the
Physical Notes but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be
appropriate for temporary Notes, all as may be determined by the Company.
Every such temporary Note shall be executed by the Company and authenticated
by the Trustee or such authenticating agent upon the same conditions and in
substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as the Physical
Notes. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall execute and deliver to
the Trustee or such authenticating agent Physical Notes (other than any Global
Note) and thereupon any or all temporary Notes (other than any Global Note)
may be surrendered in exchange therefor, at each office or agency maintained
by the Company pursuant to Section 4.02 and the Trustee or such
authenticating agent shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such
temporary Notes an equal aggregate principal amount of Physical Notes upon the
written request of the Company. Such exchange shall be made by the Company at
its own expense and without any charge therefor. Until so exchanged, the
temporary Notes shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits and
subject to the same limitations under this Indenture as Physical Notes
authenticated and delivered hereunder.

Section 2.08 _Cancellation of Notes Paid, Converted, Etc._ The Company shall
cause all Notes surrendered for the purpose of payment at maturity,
registration of transfer or exchange or conversion, if surrendered to any
Person that the Company controls other than the Trustee, to be surrendered to
the Trustee for cancellation and they will no longer be considered
outstanding under this Indenture upon their payment at maturity, registration
of transfer or exchange or conversion. All Notes delivered to the Trustee
shall be canceled promptly by it. Except for any Notes surrendered for
registration of transfer or exchange, or as otherwise expressly permitted by
any of the provisions of this Indenture, no Notes shall be authenticated in
exchange for any Notes surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation. The
Trustee shall dispose of canceled Notes in accordance with its customary
procedures. After such cancellation, the Trustee shall deliver a certificate
of such cancellation to the Company, at the Companys written request in a
Company Order. 

Section 2.09 _CUSIP Numbers_. The Company in issuing the Notes may use CUSIP
numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use CUSIP
numbers in all notices issued to Holders as a convenience to such Holders;
_provided_ that the Trustee shall have no liability for any defect in the
CUSIP numbers as they appear on any Note, notice or elsewhere and that any
such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of
such numbers either as printed on the Notes or on such notice and that
reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the
Notes. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change
in the CUSIP numbers.

Section 2.10 _Additional Notes; Repurchases_. The Company may, with the
consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding, reopen this Indenture and issue additional Notes
hereunder with the same terms as the Notes initially issued hereunder (other
than differences in the issue date, the issue price and interest accrued prior
to the issue date of such additional Notes) in an unlimited aggregate
principal amount; _provided_ that if any such additional Notes are
not fungible with the Notes initially issued hereunder for U.S. federal
income tax or securities laws purposes, such additional Notes shall have a
separate CUSIP number, ISIN or other identifying numbers. Prior to the
issuance of any such additional Notes, the Company shall deliver to the
Trustee a Company Order, an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
such Officers Certificate and Opinion of Counsel to cover such matters, in
addition to those required by Sections 10.05 and 17.05, as the Trustee shall
reasonably request. In addition, the Company may, to the extent permitted by
law and without the consent of Holders, and directly or indirectly (regardless
of whether such Notes are surrendered to the Company), repurchase Notes in
the open market or otherwise, whether by the Company or its

 



22

    

 Subsidiaries or through a private or public tender or exchange offer or
through counterparties to private agreements, including by cash-settled swaps
or other derivatives. The Company may, at its option and to the extent
permitted by applicable law, reissue, resell, hold or surrender to the Trustee
for cancellation in accordance with Section 2.08 any Notes that the Company
may repurchase, in the case of a reissuance or resale, so long as such Notes
do not constitute "restricted securities" (as defined under Rule 144) upon
such reissuance or resale. Any Notes that the Company may repurchase shall be
considered outstanding for all purposes under this Indenture (other than, at
any time when such Notes are held by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
its Affiliates or any Subsidiary of any of such Affiliates, for the purpose of
determining whether Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of
Notes have concurred in any direction, consent, waiver or other action under
this Indenture) unless and until such time the Company surrenders them to the
Trustee for cancellation in accordance with Section 2.08 and, upon receipt of
a written order from the Company, the Trustee shall cancel all Notes so
surrendered.

ARTICLE 3

 

SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE

 

Section 3.01 _Satisfaction and Discharge_ _._ This Indenture and the Notes
shall upon request of the Company contained in an Officers Certificate cease
to be of further effect, and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall
execute proper instruments reasonably requested by the Company acknowledging
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture and the Notes, when (a) (i) all
Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than Notes which have
been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced, paid or converted
as provided in Section 2.06) have been delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation; or (ii) after the Notes have (x) become due and payable,
whether on the Maturity Date, on any Fundamental Change Repurchase Date or
otherwise and/or (y) been converted (and the related consideration due upon
conversion has been determined), the Company has deposited with the Trustee
cash and/or has delivered to Holders shares of Common Stock, as applicable,
(in the case of Common Stock, solely to satisfy the Companys Conversion
Obligation) sufficient, without consideration of reinvestment, to pay all of
the outstanding Notes and all other sums due and payable under this Indenture
by the Company; and (b) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions
precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of
this Indenture have been complied with. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and
discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee
under Section 7.06 shall survive.

ARTICLE 4

 

PARTICULAR COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY

 

Section 4.01 _Payment of Principal and Interest_. The Company covenants and
agrees that it will cause to be paid the principal (including the Fundamental
Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) of, the Settlement Amounts owed upon
conversion on, and accrued and unpaid interest on, each of the Notes at the
places, at the respective times and in the manner provided herein and in the
Notes.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Indenture, the
Company or Paying Agent may, to the extent it is required to do so by law,
deduct or withhold income or other similar taxes imposed by the United States
of America from principal, premium or Interest or Defaulted Amounts payments
hereunder.

 

Section 4.02 _Maintenance of Office or Agency_. The Company will maintain in
the United States an office or agency where the Notes may be surrendered for
registration of transfer or exchange or for presentation for payment or
repurchase ("Paying Agent") or for conversion ("Conversion Agent") and where
notices in respect of the Notes and this Indenture may be made. The Company
will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change
in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall
fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish
the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices
and demands may be made at the Corporate Trust Office.

 



23

    

The Company may also from time to time designate a Paying Agent one or more
other offices or agencies where the Notes may be presented or surrendered for
any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations;
_provided_ that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve
the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the United
States for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the
Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the
location of any such other office or agency. The terms "Paying Agent" and
"Conversion Agent" include any such additional or other offices or agencies,
as applicable.

 

The Company hereby initially designates the Trustee as the Paying Agent, Note
Registrar, Custodian and Conversion Agent and the Corporate Trust Office as a
place where Notes may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange
or for presentation for payment or repurchase (if applicable) or for
conversion and where notices in respect of the Notes and this Indenture may be
made;  _provided_ that no office of the Trustee shall be a place for service
of legal process on the Company.

Section 4.03  _Appointments to Fill Vacancies in Trustee_ __ _s Office_. The
Company, whenever necessary to avoid or fill a vacancy in the office of
Trustee, will appoint, in the manner provided in Section 7.10, a Trustee, so
that there shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder.

Section 4.04 _Provisions as to Paying Agent_. (a) If the Company shall
appoint a Paying Agent other than the Trustee, the Company will cause such
Paying Agent to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such
agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section
4.04:

 

(i) that it will hold all sums held by it as such agent for the payment of the
principal (including the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable)
of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes in trust for the benefit of
the Holders of the Notes;

 

(ii) that it will give the Trustee prompt written notice of any failure by the
Company to make any payment of the principal (including the Fundamental
Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) of, and accrued and unpaid interest
on, the Notes when the same shall be due and payable; and

 

(iii) that at any time during the continuance of an Event of Default, upon
request of the Trustee, it will forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held
in trust;

_provided_ , that a Paying Agent appointed as contemplated under Section
15.02(f) shall not be required to deliver any such instrument.

The Company shall, on or before each due date of the principal (including the
Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) of, or accrued and unpaid
interest on, the Notes, deposit with the Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay
such principal (including the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if
applicable) or such accrued and unpaid interest, and (unless such Paying
Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing
of any failure to take such action; _provided_ that if such deposit is made on
the due date, such deposit must be received by the Paying Agent by 11:00
a.m., New York City time, on such date.

 



24

    

(b) If the Company shall act as its own Paying Agent, it will, on or before

becoming due and will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any failure to
take such action and of any failure by the Company to make any payment of the
principal (including the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable)
of, or accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes when the same shall become
due and payable.

 

(c) Anything in this Section 4.04 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company
may, at any time, for the purpose of obtaining a satisfaction and discharge
of this Indenture, or for any other reason, pay, cause to be paid or deliver
to the Trustee all sums or amounts held in trust by the Company or any Paying
Agent hereunder as required by this Section 4.04, such sums or amounts to be
held by the Trustee upon the trusts herein contained and upon such payment or
delivery by the Company or any Paying Agent to the Trustee, the Company or
such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability but only

interest on and the consideration due upon conversion of any Note and
remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal (including the
Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable), interest or consideration
due upon conversion has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company
on request of the Company contained in an Officers Certificate, or (if then
held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust and the Trustee shall
have no further liability with respect to such funds; and the Holder of
such Note shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to
the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee, the
Conversion Agent or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and
all liability of the Company as trustee with respect to such trust money and
shares of Common Stock, shall thereupon cease.

Section 4.05 _Existence_. Subject to Article 11, the Company shall do or
cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and

Section 4.06 _Rule 144A Information Requirement and Annual Reports_ _._ (a) At
any time the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act, the Company shall, so long as any of the Notes or any shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall, at such time, constitute
"restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the
Securities Act, promptly provide to the Trustee and, upon written request, any
Holder, beneficial owner or prospective purchaser of such Notes or any shares
of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Notes, the

otherwise provide or disclose to, the Trustee or any Holder any information
for which the Company is requesting (assuming such request has not been
denied), or has received, confidential treatment from the Commission, or any
correspondence with the Commission. Any such document or report that the
Company files with the Commission via the Commissions EDGAR system (or any
successor thereto) shall be deemed to be delivered to the Trustee for
purposes of this Section 4.06(b) at the time such documents are filed via the
EDGAR system (or any successor thereto); _provided_ that the Trustee shall
have no obligation to determine whether such documents or reports have been
filed via the EDGAR system.

 



25

    

(c) Delivery of the reports and documents described in subsection (b) above to
the Trustee is for informational purposes only, and the Trustees receipt of

the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall not at any time insist
upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or
advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law or other law that would
prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the
principal of or interest on the Notes as contemplated herein, wherever
enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or that may affect the
covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent
it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of
any such law, and covenants that it will not, by resort to any such law,
hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the
Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as
though no such law had been enacted.

Section 4.08 _Compliance Certificate; Statements as to Defaults_. The
Company shall deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after the end of each

Default has been cured.

Section 4.09 _Further Instruments and Acts_. Upon request of the Trustee,
Paying Agent or Conversion Agent, the Company will execute and deliver such
further instruments and do such further acts as may be reasonably necessary or
proper to carry out more effectively the purposes of this Indenture.

Section 4.10 _Indebtedness Incurrence_. The Company covenants and agrees that
so long as any amount of the Notes remains outstanding under this Indenture,
if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries creates, incurs, assumes, permits to
exist, or otherwise becomes or remains directly or indirectly liable with
respect to, any Indebtedness (other than the Notes, any additional Notes
issued under this Indenture and any Permitted Indebtedness), the Company
shall:

(a) offer to redeem, in full, all outstanding principal of, and accrued and
unpaid interest on, the Notes outstanding under this Indenture; _plus_

(b) if such additional Indebtedness is incurred prior to [ ],
2023, such Redemption of the Notes shall be accompanied with a prepayment
premium equal to twelve months of interest on the principal amount of the
Notes being repaid, from the date of such debt incurrence, computed on the
basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months and, for partial
months, on the basis of the number of days actually elapsed in a 30-day month;

 



26

    

(c) if such additional Indebtedness is incurred on or after [
], 2023, such Redemption of the Notes shall be accompanied with a prepayment
premium equal to the amount of interest which would otherwise have accrued on
the Notes so repaid to, but excluding, the Maturity Date; and

(d) issue to each Holder a warrant to purchase a number of shares of Common

Notes through and including the Maturity Date for an exercise price of $11.50
per share, (B) subject to registration rights in favor of the Holder thereof

entitled with respect to those warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock
issued to such Holder in connection with the issuance of the Notes (the
"Initial Warrants"), and (C) subject to a warrant agreement to be entered
into between the Company and such Holder (or the Companys transfer agent on
behalf of such Holder) containing terms and conditions otherwise substantially
equivalent to the terms and conditions set forth in the warrant agreement
governing the Initial Warrants.

(f) Pursuant to the Redemption requirement of this Section 4.10, the Company
must send to each applicable Holder of such Notes (and to any beneficial owner
of a Global Note, if required by applicable law), the Trustee and the Paying
Agent no less than 10 days prior to the date of Redemption (the "Redemption
Date") a written notice of such Redemption (a "Redemption Notice").

Such Redemption Notice must state:

(i) that the Notes have been called for Redemption, briefly describing the
Companys Redemption right under this Indenture;

(ii) the Redemption Date for such Redemption;

 

(iii) the Redemption price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for such

Date in full, at any time until such time as the Company pays such Redemption
Price in full);

 

(vi) the Conversion Rate in effect on the Redemption Notice Date for such
Redemption;

 

(vii) that Notes called for Redemption must be delivered to the Paying Agent
(in the case of Physical Notes) or the Depositary Procedures must be complied
with (in the case of Global Notes) for the Holder thereof to be entitled to
receive the Redemption price; and

 

(viii) the CUSIP and ISIN numbers, if any, of the Notes.

 

On or before the Redemption Notice Date, the Company will send a copy of such
Redemption Notice to the Trustee and the Paying Agent. Prior to 11:00 a.m.
(New York time) on the Redemption Date, the Company will deposit with the

10 days after each [ ] and [ ] in each year
beginning with [ ], 2021, and at such other times as the
Trustee may request in writing, within 30 days after receipt by the Company of
any such request (or such lesser time as the Trustee may reasonably request

ARTICLE 6

Indenture;

 

(g) default by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of the Company with

Indebtedness for money borrowed in excess of $20,000,000 (or its foreign
currency equivalent) in the aggregate of the Company and/or any such
Significant Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness now exists or shall
hereafter be created (i) resulting in such Indebtedness becoming or being
declared due and payable prior to its stated maturity or (ii) constituting a
failure to pay 

 



28

    

 the principal or interest of any such debt when due and payable at its
stated maturity, upon required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or
otherwise, in each case, after the expiration of any applicable grace period,
if such acceleration shall not have been rescinded or annulled or such failure
to pay or default shall not have been cured or waived, or such Indebtedness
shall not have been paid or discharged, as the case may be, within thirty
(30) days after written notice to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company
and the Trustee by Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of
Notes then outstanding in accordance with this Indenture;

 

(h) the Company or any Significant Subsidiary shall commence a voluntary case
or other proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with
respect to the Company or any such Significant Subsidiary or its debts under
any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or
seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or
other similar official of the Company or any such Significant Subsidiary or
any substantial part of its property, or shall consent to any such relief or
to the appointment of or taking possession by any such official in an
involuntary case or other proceeding commenced against it, or shall make a
general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall publicly admit in
writing that it generally is not paying, or is unable to pay, its debts as
they become due; or

 

(i) an involuntary case or other proceeding shall be commenced against the
Company or any Significant Subsidiary seeking liquidation, reorganization or
other relief with respect to the Company or such Significant Subsidiary or its
debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter
in effect or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver,
liquidator, custodian or other similar official of the Company or such
Significant Subsidiary or any substantial part of its property, and such
involuntary case or other proceeding shall remain undismissed and unstayed for
a period of sixty (60) consecutive days.

Section 6.02 _Acceleration; Rescission and Annulment_. If one or more Events
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (whatever the reason for
such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be
effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of
any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or
governmental body), then, and in each and every such case (other than an Event
of Default specified in Section 6.01(h) or Section 6.01(i) with respect to the
Company), unless the principal of all of the Notes shall have already become
due and payable, either the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding determined in
accordance with Section 8.04, by notice in writing to the Company (and to
the Trustee if given by Holders), may declare 100% of the principal of, and
accrued and unpaid interest on, all the Notes to be due and payable
immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall
automatically be immediately due and payable, anything contained in this
Indenture or in the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding. If an Event of
Default specified in Section 6.01(h) or Section 6.01(i) with respect to the
Company occurs and is continuing, 100% of the principal of, and accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, on, all Notes shall become and shall automatically be
immediately due and payable.

 

The immediately preceding paragraph, however, is subject to the conditions
that if, at any time after the principal or interest of the Notes shall have
been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the
payment of the monies due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter
provided, the Company shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum
sufficient to pay installments of accrued and unpaid interest upon all Notes
and the principal of any and all Notes that shall have become due otherwise
than by acceleration (with interest on overdue installments of accrued and
unpaid interest to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable
under applicable law, and on such principal at the rate borne by the Notes at
such time) and amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to Section 7.06, and if (1)
rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction and (2)

 



29

    

 any and all existing Events of Default under this Indenture, other than the
uncured nonpayment of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, on Notes that shall have become due solely by such acceleration, shall
have been cured or waived pursuant to Section 6.09, then and in every such
case (except as provided in the immediately succeeding sentence) the Holders
of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by
written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may waive all Defaults or
Events of Default with respect to the Notes and rescind and annul such
declaration and its consequences and such Default shall cease to exist, and
any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for
every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver or rescission and
annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent Default or Event of
Default, or shall impair any right consequent thereon. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, no such waiver or rescission and annulment
shall extend to or shall affect any Default or Event of Default resulting from
(i) the nonpayment of the principal (including the Fundamental Change
Repurchase Price, if applicable) of, or accrued and unpaid interest on, any
Notes, (ii) a failure to repurchase any Notes when required or (iii) a failure
to pay or deliver, as the case may be, the consideration due upon conversion
of the Notes.

Section 6.03 _Additional Interest_. Notwithstanding anything in this Indenture
or in the Notes to the contrary, to the extent the Company elects, the sole
remedy for an Event of Default relating to the Companys failure to comply
with its obligations as set forth in Section 4.06(b) shall after the
occurrence of such an Event of Default consist exclusively of the right to
receive Additional Interest on the Notes at a rate equal to: (i) 2.00% per
annum of the principal amount of the Notes outstanding for each day during the
period beginning on, and including, the date on which such Event of Default
first occurs and ending on the earlier of (x) the date on which such Event of
Default is cured or validly waived in accordance with this Article 6 and (y)
the 180th day immediately following, and including, the date on which such
Event of Default first occurs and (ii) if such Event of Default has not been
cured or validly waived prior to the 181st day immediately following, and
including, the date on which such Event of Default first occurs, 0.50%
per annum of the principal amount of Notes outstanding for each day during
the period beginning on, and including, the 181st day immediately following,
and including, the date on which such Event of Default first occurs and ending
on the earlier of (x) the date on which the Event of Default is cured or
validly waived in accordance with this Article 6 and (y) the 360th day
immediately following, and including, the date on which such Event of Default
first occurs. If the Company so elects, such Additional Interest shall be
payable in the same manner and on the same dates as the stated interest
payable on the Notes and shall accrue on all outstanding Notes from, and
including, the date on which the Event of Default relating to the Companys
failure to comply with its obligations as set forth in Section 4.06(b) first
occurs to, and including, the 360th day thereafter (or such earlier date on
which such Event of Default is cured or validly waived in accordance with
this Article 6). On the 361st day after such Event of Default (if the Event of
Default relating to the Companys failure to comply with its obligations as
set forth in Section 4.06(b) is not cured or validly waived in
accordance with this Article 6 prior to such 361st day), such Additional
Interest shall cease to accrue and the Notes shall be immediately subject to
acceleration as provided in Section 6.02. The provisions of this paragraph
will not affect the rights of Holders of Notes in the event of the occurrence
of any Event of Default other than the Companys failure to comply with its
obligations as set forth in Section 4.06(b). In the event the Company does not
elect to pay Additional Interest following an Event of Default in accordance
with this Section 6.03 or the Company has elected to make such payment but
does not pay the Additional Interest when due, the Notes shall be immediately
subject to acceleration as provided in Section 6.02.

In order to elect to pay Additional Interest as the sole remedy during the
first 360 days after the occurrence of any Event of Default described in the
immediately preceding paragraph, the Company must notify all Holders of the
Notes, the Trustee and the Paying Agent in an Officers Certificate of such
election on or before the open of business on the Business Day immediately
succeeding the date on which such Event of Default first occurs. Upon the
failure to timely give such notice, the Notes shall be immediately subject to
acceleration as provided in Section 6.02. The Officers Certificate under
this Section 6.03(b) shall state (i) the amount of such Additional Indenture
that is payable and (ii) the date on which such Additional Interest is
payable. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives at
the Corporate Trust Office such Officers Certificate, the Trustee may assume
without inquiry that no such Additional Interest is payable.

 



30

    

In no event shall any Additional Interest that may accrue as a result of the
Companys failure to timely file any document or report that it is required
to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act, as applicable, after giving effect to all applicable grace periods
thereunder and other than reports on Form 8-K), accrue at a rate in excess of
0.50% per annum pursuant to this Indenture, regardless of the number of events
or circumstances giving rise to the requirement to pay such
Additional Interest.

Section 6.04 _Payments of Notes on Default; Suit Therefor_. If an Event of
Default described in clause (a) or (b) of Section 6.01 shall have occurred
and be continuing, the Company shall, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to the
Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, the whole amount then
due and payable on the Notes for principal and interest, if any, with
interest on any overdue principal and interest, if any, at the rate borne by
the Notes at such time, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall
be sufficient to cover any amounts due to the Trustee under Section 7.06. If
the Company shall fail to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the
Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a
judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid,
may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the
same against the Company or any other obligor upon the Notes and collect the
moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of
the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the Notes, wherever
situated.

In the event there shall be pending proceedings for the bankruptcy or for the
reorganization of the Company or any other obligor on the Notes under Title 11
of the United States Code, or any other applicable law, or in case a receiver,
assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator
or similar official shall have been appointed for or taken possession of the
Company, the property of the Company, or in the event of any other judicial
proceedings relative to the Company, or to the creditors or property of the
Company, the Trustee, irrespective of whether the principal of the Notes
shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or
otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.04, shall be entitled and
empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise, to file and prove
a claim or claims for the whole amount of principal and accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, in respect of the Notes, and, in case of any judicial
proceedings, to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents and to
take such other actions as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to have
the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee,
its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial
proceedings relative to the Company, its creditors, or its property, and to
collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on
any such claims, and to distribute the same after the deduction of any amounts
due to the Trustee under Section 7.06; and any receiver, assignee or trustee
in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, custodian or similar official is
hereby authorized by each of the Holders to make such payments to the Trustee,
as administrative expenses, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent
to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee
any amount due it for reasonable compensation, expenses, advances and
disbursements, including agents and counsel fees, and including any other
amounts due to the Trustee under Section 7.06, incurred by it up to the date
of such distribution. To the extent that such payment of reasonable
compensation, expenses, advances and disbursements out of the estate in any
such proceedings shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be
secured by a lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions,
dividends, monies, securities and other property that the Holders of the Notes
may be entitled to receive in such proceedings, whether in liquidation or
under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise.

 



31

    

Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize
or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting such Holder
or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in
respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under
any of the Notes, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of
any of the Notes, or the production thereof at any trial or other proceeding
relative thereto, and any such suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee
shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any
recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents
and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes.

 

In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and in any proceedings involving
the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the Trustee
shall be a party) the Trustee shall be held to represent all the Holders of
the Notes, and it shall not be necessary to make any Holders of the Notes
parties to any such proceedings.

 

In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this
Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned
because of any waiver pursuant to Section 6.09 or any rescission and annulment
pursuant to Section 6.02 or for any other reason or shall have been determined
adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Company,
the Holders and the Trustee shall, subject to any determination in such
proceeding, be restored respectively to their several positions and rights
hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company, the Holders and
the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

Section 6.05 _Application of Monies Collected by Trustee_. Any
monies collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article 6 with respect to
the Notes shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed
by the Trustee for the distribution of such monies, upon presentation of the
several Notes, and stamping thereon the payment, if only partially paid, and
upon surrender thereof, if fully paid:

First, to the payment of all amounts due the Trustee, including its agents
and counsel, under Section 7.06;

Second, in case the principal of the outstanding Notes shall not have become
due and be unpaid, to the payment of any interest on, and any cash due upon
conversion of, the Notes in default in the order of the date due of the
payments of such interest and cash due upon conversion, as the case may be,
with interest (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the
Trustee) payable upon such overdue payments at the rate borne by the Notes at
such time, such payments to be made ratably to the Persons entitled thereto; 

Third, in case the principal of the outstanding Notes shall have become due,
by declaration or otherwise, and be unpaid to the payment of the whole amount
(including, if applicable, the payment of the Fundamental Change Repurchase
Price and any cash due upon conversion) then owing and unpaid upon the Notes
for principal and interest, if any, with interest on the overdue principal
and, to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee, upon
overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by the Notes at such time,
and in case such monies shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amounts
so due and unpaid upon the Notes, then to the payment of such principal
(including, if applicable, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price and any
cash due upon conversion) and interest without preference or priority of
principal over interest, or of interest over principal or of any installment
of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Note over any
other Note, ratably to the aggregate of such principal (including, if
applicable, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price and any cash due upon
conversion) and accrued and unpaid interest; and

 



32

    

Fourth, to the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company.

 

Section 6.06 _Proceedings by Holders_. Except to enforce the right to receive
payment of principal (including, if applicable, the Fundamental Change
Repurchase Price) or interest when due, or the right to receive payment or
delivery of the consideration due upon conversion, no Holder of any Note shall
have any right by virtue of or by availing of any provision of this Indenture
to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under
or with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver,
trustee, liquidator, custodian or other similar official, or for any other
remedy hereunder, unless:

(a) such Holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of
an Event of Default and of the continuance thereof, as herein provided;

(b) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute
such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as Trustee hereunder;

(c) such Holders shall have offered, and, if requested, provided, to the
Trustee such security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any
loss, liability or expense to be incurred therein or thereby;

 

(d) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and
offer of such security or indemnity, shall have neglected or refused to
institute any such action, suit or proceeding; and

(e) no direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with
such written request shall have been given to the Trustee by the Holders of a
majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
within such 60-day period pursuant to Section 6.09,

 

it being understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted by the taker
and Holder of every Note with every other taker and Holder and the Trustee
that no one or more Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by
virtue of or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb
or prejudice the rights of any other Holder (it being understood that the
Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not such
actions or forbearances are prejudicial to any other Holder), or to obtain or
seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such Holder, or to
enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided
and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all Holders (except as
otherwise provided herein). For the protection and enforcement of this Section
6.06, each and every Holder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief
as can be given either at law or in equity.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture and any provision of
any Note, each Holder shall have the contractual right to receive payment or
delivery, as the case may be, of (x) the principal (including the Fundamental
Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) of, (y) accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, on, and (z) the consideration due upon conversion of, such Note, on
or after the respective due dates expressed or provided for in such Note or in
this Indenture, and the contractual right to institute suit for the
enforcement of any such payment or delivery, as the case may be, on or after
such respective dates, shall not be amended without the consent of each
Holder.

Section 6.07 _Proceedings by Trustee_. In case of an Event of Default, the
Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights
vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings as are
necessary to protect and enforce any of such rights, either by suit in equity
or by action at law or by proceeding in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for
the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture, or
to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this
Indenture or by law.

Section 6.08 _Remedies Cumulative and Continuing_. Except as provided in
the last paragraph of Section 2.06, all powers and remedies given by this
Article 6 to the Trustee or to the Holders shall, to the extent permitted by
law, be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any thereof or of any other
powers and remedies available to the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes, by
judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or observance of
the covenants and agreements contained in this Indenture, and no delay or
omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any of the Notes to exercise any
right or power accruing upon any Default or Event of Default shall impair any
such right or power, or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Default
or Event of Default or any acquiescence therein; and, subject to the
provisions of Section 6.06, every power and remedy given by this Article 6 or
by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time,
and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders.
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any Notes or
does not produce any Notes in the proceeding.

 

Section 6.09 _Direction of Proceedings and Waiver of Defaults by Majority of
Holders_. The Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 8.04 shall
have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or
power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Notes; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of
law or with this Indenture, and (b) the Trustee may take any other
action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such
direction. The Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that it determines
is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve
the Trustee in personal liability or for which it has not received indemnity
or security satisfactory to the Trustee against loss, liability or expense (it
being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to
determine whether any direction is prejudicial to any Holder). The Holders of
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding
determined in accordance with Section 8.04 may on behalf of the Holders of all
of the Notes (x) waive any past Default or Event of Default hereunder and its
consequences except (i) a default in the payment of accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, on, or the principal (including any Fundamental Change
Repurchase Price) of, the Notes when due that has not been cured pursuant to
the provisions of Section 6.01, (ii) a failure by the Company to pay or
deliver, as the case may be, the consideration due upon conversion of the
Notes or (iii) a default in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which
under Article 10 cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each
Holder of an outstanding Note affected; and (y) rescind any resulting
acceleration of the Notes and its consequences if (i) such rescission would
not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction
and (ii) all existing Events of Default (other than nonpayment of the
principal of, and interest on, the Notes that have become due solely by such
acceleration) have been cured or waived. Upon any such waiver the Company,
the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes shall be restored to their former
positions and rights hereunder; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right
consequent thereon. Whenever any Default or Event of Default hereunder shall
have been waived as permitted by this Section 6.09, said Default or Event of
Default shall for all purposes of the Notes and this Indenture be deemed to
have been cured and to be not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to
any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

 



34

    

Section 6.10 _Notice of Defaults_. The Trustee shall, after the occurrence
and continuance of a Default of which a Responsible Officer has actual
knowledge, deliver to all Holders notice of such Default within 90 days after
such Responsible Officer obtains such knowledge, unless such Defaults shall
have been cured or waived before the giving of such notice; provided that,
except in the case of a Default in the payment of the principal of (including
the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable), or accrued and unpaid
interest on, any of the Notes or a Default in the payment or delivery of the
consideration due upon conversion, the Trustee shall be protected in
withholding such notice if and so long as a Responsible Officer of the Trustee
in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the
interests of the Holders.

Section 6.11 _Undertaking to Pay Costs_. All parties to this Indenture agree,
and each Holder of any Note by its acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have
agreed, that any court may, in its discretion, require, in any suit for the
enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit
against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the
filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs
of such suit and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable
costs, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, against any party
litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the
claims or defenses made by such party litigant; provided that the provisions
of this Section 6.11 (to the extent permitted by law) shall not apply to any
suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group
of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the
Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 8.04, or
to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of
the principal of or accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on any Note
(including, but not limited to, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if
applicable) on or after the due date expressed or provided for in such Note
or to any suit for the enforcement of the right to convert any Note, or
receive the consideration due upon conversion, in accordance with the
provisions of Article 14\.

time from and after the issue date of the Notes, the Company shall fail, for
any reason or for no reason, on or prior to the second (2nd) Trading Day after

to the Company, may void its Conversion Notice with respect to, and retain or
have returned, as the case may be, all, or any portion, of such Notes that has

after the issue date of the Notes, if on or prior to the Share Delivery
Deadline either (A) the Transfer Agent is not participating in the DTC Fast

Share Delivery Deadline such Holder purchases (in an open market transaction
or otherwise) shares of Common Stock corresponding to all or any portion of
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion that such
Holder is entitled to receive from the Company and has not received from the
Company in connection with such Delivery Failure or Notice Failure, as
applicable (a "Buy-In"), then, in addition to all other remedies available to
such Holder, the Company shall, within two (2) Business Days after receipt of
such Holders request and in such Holders discretion, either: (I) pay cash
to such Holder in an amount equal to such Holders total purchase price
(including brokerage commissions and other out-of-pocket expenses, if any)
for the shares of Common Stock so purchased (including, without limitation, by
any other Person in respect, or on behalf, of such Holder) (the "Buy-In
Price"), at which point the Companys obligation to so issue and deliver such
certificate (and to issue such shares of Common Stock) or credit to the

such shares of Common Stock) shall terminate, or (II) promptly honor its
obligation to so issue and deliver to such Holder a certificate or
certificates representing such shares of Common Stock or credit the balance
account of such Holder or such Holders designee, as applicable, with DTC for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon
such Holders conversion hereunder (as the case may be) and pay cash to such
Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price over the
product of (x) such number of shares of Common Stock multiplied by (y) the
lowest Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on any Trading Day during the
period commencing on the date of the applicable Conversion Notice and ending
on the date of such issuance and payment under this clause (II). Nothing
herein shall limit the Holders right to pursue any other remedies available
to it hereunder, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, a decree
of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Companys
failure to timely deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock (or
to electronically deliver such shares of Common Stock) upon the conversion of
this Note as required pursuant to the terms hereof. Neither the Trustee nor
the Conversion Agent has any duty to determine whether a Notice Failure,
Delivery Failure or Buy-In has occurred, calculate or verify the calculations
of Buy-In Price or notify Holders of any of the foregoing.

 

ARTICLE 7

CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE 

Section 7.01 _Duties and Responsibilities of Trustee_. The Trustee, prior to
the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing or waiver of all
Events of Default that may have occurred, undertakes to perform such duties
and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture. If an

 



36

    

 Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise
such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same
degree of care and skill in its exercise, as a prudent person would exercise
or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such persons own affairs;
provided that the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers under this Indenture at the request or direction of any of
the Holders unless such Holders have offered, and if requested, provided to
the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any
loss, liability or expense that might be incurred by it in compliance with
such request or direction.

No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from
liability for its own grossly negligent action, its own grossly negligent
failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:

(a) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing or
waiving of all Events of Default that may have occurred:

(i) the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall be determined solely by
the express provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee shall not be liable
except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically
set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be
read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and

(ii) in the absence of gross negligence and willful misconduct on the part of
the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the
statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any
certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the
requirements of this Indenture; but, in the case of any such certificates or
opinions that by any provisions hereof are specifically required to be
furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the
same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this
Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of any
mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein);

 

(b) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good
faith by a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee, unless it shall be
proved that the Trustee was grossly negligent in ascertaining the pertinent
facts;

(c) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of
the Holders of not less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of
the Notes at the time outstanding determined as provided in Section 8.04
relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred
upon the Trustee, under this Indenture;

 

(d) whether or not therein provided, every provision of this Indenture
relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of, or
affording protection to, the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of
this Section;

(e) the Trustee shall not be liable in respect of any payment (as to the
correctness of amount, entitlement to receive or any other matters relating to
payment) or notice effected by the Company or any Paying Agent or any records
maintained by any co-Note Registrar with respect to the Notes;

(f) if any party fails to deliver a notice relating to an event the fact of
which, pursuant to this Indenture, requires notice to be sent to the Trustee,
the Trustee may conclusively rely on its failure to receive such notice as
reason to act as if no such event occurred;

 



37

    

(g) in the absence of written investment direction from the Company, all cash
received by the Trustee shall be placed in a non-interest bearing trust
account, and in no event shall the Trustee be liable for the selection of
investments or for investment losses incurred thereon or for losses incurred
as a result of the liquidation of any such investment prior to its maturity
date or the failure of the party directing such investments prior to its
maturity date or the failure of the party directing such investment to provide
timely written investment direction, and the Trustee shall have no obligation
to invest or reinvest any amounts held hereunder in the absence of such
written investment direction from the Company; and

 

(h) in the event that the Trustee is also acting as Custodian, Note Registrar,
Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or transfer agent hereunder, the rights and
protections afforded to the Trustee pursuant to this Article 7 shall also be
afforded to such Custodian, Note Registrar, Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or
transfer agent.

 

None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require the Trustee
to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial
liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of
its rights or powers.

Section 7.02  _Reliance on Documents, Opinions, Etc._ Except as otherwise
provided in Section 7.01:

(a) The Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in acting
upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report,
notice, request, consent, judgment, order, bond, note, coupon or other paper
or document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and to have been

herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers Certificate (unless
other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed); and any
Board Resolution may be evidenced to the Trustee by a copy thereof certified
by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company. Before the Trustee
acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officers Certificate or an
Opinion of Counsel or both. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it
takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such Officers
Certificate or Opinion of Counsel.

(c) The Trustee may consult with counsel and require an Opinion of Counsel
and any advice of such counsel or Opinion of Counsel shall be full and
complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or
omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance on such advice or
Opinion of Counsel.

(d) The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or
matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument,
opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, judgment, bond,
debenture or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may
make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it
may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine in its reasonable judgment to
make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled, at a
reasonable time on any Business Day after reasonable notice, to examine the
books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or
attorney at the expense of the Company and shall incur no liability of any
kind by reason of such inquiry or investigation.

 



38

    

(e) The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform
any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents, custodians,
nominees or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any
misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent, custodian, nominee or
attorney appointed by it with due care hereunder, and the permissive rights
of the Trustee enumerated herein shall not be construed as duties.

(f) The Trustee shall not be required to give any bond or surety in respect
of the execution of the trusts and powers under this Indenture.

(g) The Trustee may request that the Company deliver an Officers Certificate
setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at
such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which
Officers Certificate may be signed by any Person authorized to sign an
Officers Certificate, including any Person specified as so authorized in any
such certificate previously delivered and not superseded.

 

(h) The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of
Default (except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment of
scheduled principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, any Note) unless a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless
written notice of any event which is in fact such a Default or Event of
Default (and stating the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default) is
actually received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee,
and such notice references the Notes and this Indenture and states that it is
a "Notice of Default". 

(i) The Trustee shall not be responsible or liable for any action it takes or
omits to take in good faith which it reasonably believes to be authorized or
within its rights or powers.

omitted by it in good faith at the direction of the holders of not less than
a majority in principal amount of the Notes as to the time, method and place

exercising of any power conferred by this Indenture.

(k) Neither the Trustee nor any of its directors, officers, employees, agents
or affiliates shall be responsible for nor have any duty to monitor the
performance or any action of the Company, or any of their respective
directors, members, officers, agents, affiliates or employee, nor shall it
have any liability in connection with the malfeasance or nonfeasance by such
party. The Trustee shall not be responsible for any inaccuracy in the

willful misconduct or gross negligence as determined by a final order of a
court of competent jurisdiction. The Trustee shall not be charged with
knowledge of any Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes,
unless either (1) a Responsible Officer shall have actual knowledge of such
Default or Event of Default or (2) written notice of such Default or Event of
Default shall have been actually received by the Trustee at the Corporate
Trust Office of the Trustee, from the Company or any Holder of the Notes, and

39

    

Section 7.03 _No Responsibility for Recitals, Etc._ The recitals contained
herein and in the Notes (except in the Trustees certificate of
authentication) shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and the
Trustee assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the same. The Trustee
makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture
or of the Notes or other transaction documents relating to the Notes and this
Indenture. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by
the Company of any Notes or the proceeds of any Notes authenticated and
delivered by the Trustee in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture
or any money paid to the Company or upon the Companys direction under any
provision of this Indenture.

 

Section 7.04 _Trustee, Paying Agents, Conversion Agents or Note Registrar May
Own Notes_. The Trustee, any Paying Agent, any Conversion Agent or Note
Registrar (in each case, if other than an Affiliate of the Company), in its
individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes
with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee, Paying Agent,
Conversion Agent or Note Registrar.

Section 7.05 _Monies and Shares of Common Stock to Be Held in Trust_. All
monies and shares of Common Stock received by the Trustee shall, until used
or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for which
they were received. Money and shares of Common Stock held by the Trustee in
trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent
required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any
money received by it hereunder except as may be agreed from time to time by
the Company and the Trustee.

 

Section 7.06 _Compensation and Expenses of Trustee_. The Company covenants and
agrees to pay to the Trustee from time to time, and the Trustee shall be
entitled to, compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder in any
capacity (which shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the
compensation of a trustee of an express trust) as mutually agreed to
in writing between the Trustee and the Company, and the Company will pay or
reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with
any of the provisions of this Indenture in any capacity hereunder (including
the compensation and the reasonable expenses and disbursements of its agents
and counsel and of all Persons not regularly in its employ) except any such
expense, disbursement or advance as shall have been caused by its gross
negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final order of a court of
competent jurisdiction. The Company also covenants to indemnify the Trustee in
any capacity under this Indenture and any other document or transaction
entered into in connection herewith and its agents and any authenticating
agent for, and to hold them harmless against, any loss, claim, damage,
liability or expense (including attorneys fees) incurred without gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee, its officers,
directors, agents or employees, or such agent or authenticating agent, as the
case may be, as determined by a final order of a court of competent
jurisdiction, and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of this Indenture or in any other capacity hereunder (whether
such claims arise by or against the Company or a third person), including the
reasonable costs and expenses of defending themselves against any claim of
liability in the premises or enforcing the Companys obligations hereunder.
The obligations of the Company under this Section 7.06 to compensate or
indemnify the Trustee and to pay or reimburse the Trustee for expenses,
disbursements and advances shall be secured by a senior lien to which the
Notes are hereby made subordinate on all money or property held or collected
by the Trustee, except, subject to the effect of Section 6.05, funds held in
trust herewith for the benefit of the Holders of particular Notes. The
Trustees right to receive payment of any amounts due under this Section 7.06
shall not be subordinate to any other liability or Indebtedness of the
Company. The obligation of the Company under this Section 7.06 shall survive
the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the payment or conversion of
the Notes and the earlier resignation or removal of the Trustee. The Company
need not pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. The indemnification provided in this Section
7.06 shall extend to the officers, directors, agents and employees of the
Trustee.

 



40

    

Without prejudice to any other rights available to the Trustee under
applicable law, when the Trustee and its agents and any authenticating agent
incur expenses or render services after an Event of Default specified in
Section 6.01(h) or Section 6.01(i) occurs, the expenses and the compensation
for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under
any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws.

Section 7.07 _Officer_ __ _s Certificate as Evidence_. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 7.01, whenever in the administration of the provisions of
this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter
be proved or established prior to taking or omitting any action hereunder,
such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically
prescribed) may, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on
the part of the Trustee, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established
by an Officers Certificate delivered to the Trustee, and such Officers
Certificate, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the
part of the Trustee, shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action
taken or omitted by it under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith
thereof.

Section 7.08 _Eligibility of Trustee_. There shall at all times be a Trustee
hereunder which shall be a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust
Indenture Act (as if the Trust Indenture Act were applicable hereto) to act as
such and has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If such
Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to
the requirements of any supervising or examining authority, then for the
purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Person
shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its
most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee shall
cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it
shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter

Section 7.09 _Resignation or Removal of Trustee_. (a) The Trustee may at any
time resign by giving written notice of such resignation to the Company. Upon
receiving such notice of resignation, the Company shall promptly notify all
Holders and appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in duplicate,
executed by order of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument
shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor
trustee. If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed and
have accepted appointment within 60 days after the giving of such notice of
resignation to the Company, the resigning Trustee may, upon ten Business Days
notice to the Company and the Holders and at the expense of the Company,
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide holder of a Note or
Notes for at least six months (or since the date of this Indenture) may,
subject to the provisions of Section 6.11, on behalf of himself or herself
and all others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment
of a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any,
as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee.

(a) In case at any time any of the following shall occur:

 

(i) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions
of Section 7.09 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by
the Company or by any such Holder, or

(ii) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a
bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall
be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the
Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of
rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,

 



41

    

then, in either case, the Company may by a Board Resolution remove the Trustee
and appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, executed
by order of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be
delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee, or,
subject to the provisions of Section 6.11, any Holder who has been a bona
fide holder of a Note or Notes for at least six months (or since the date of
this Indenture) may, on behalf of himself or herself and all others similarly
situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the
Trustee and the appointment of a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon,
after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the
Trustee and appoint a successor trustee.

 

(b) The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at
the time outstanding, as determined in accordance with Section 8.04, may at
any time remove the Trustee and nominate a successor trustee that shall be
deemed appointed as successor trustee unless within ten days after notice to
the Company of such nomination the Company objects thereto, in which case the
Trustee so removed or any Holder, upon the terms and conditions and otherwise
as in Section 7.09(a) provided, may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for an appointment of a successor trustee.

 

(c) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor
trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 7.10 shall become
effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as provided
in Section 7.11.

 

Section 7.10 _Acceptance by Successor Trustee_. Any successor trustee
appointed as provided in Section 7.10 shall execute, acknowledge and deliver
to the Company and to its predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such
appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the
predecessor trustee shall become effective and such successor trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor hereunder, with like
effect as if originally named as Trustee herein; but, nevertheless, on the
written request of the Company or of the successor trustee, the trustee
ceasing to act shall, upon payment of any amounts then due it pursuant to the
provisions of Section 7.06, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to
such successor trustee all the rights and powers of the trustee so ceasing to
act. Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Company shall execute any
and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and
confirming to such successor trustee all such rights and powers. Any trustee
ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a senior lien to which the Notes
are hereby made subordinate on all money or property held or collected by such
trustee as such, except for funds held in trust for the benefit of Holders of
particular Notes, to secure any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions
of Section 7.06.

No successor trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this Section
7.11 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee shall be
eligible under the provisions of Section 7.09.

 

Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided in this
Section 7.11, each of the Company and the successor trustee, at the written
direction and at the expense of the Company shall deliver or cause to be
delivered notice of the succession of such trustee hereunder to the Holders.
If the Company fails to deliver such notice within ten days after acceptance
of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause
such notice to be delivered at the expense of the Company.

 



42

    

Section 7.11 _Succession by Merger, Etc._ Any corporation or other entity
into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation or other entity resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any
corporation or other entity succeeding to all or substantially all of the
corporate trust business of the Trustee (including the administration of this
Indenture), shall be the successor to the Trustee hereunder without the
execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the
parties hereto; provided that in the case of any corporation or other entity
succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the
Trustee such corporation or other entity shall be eligible under
the provisions of Section 7.08.

In case at the time such successor to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts
created by this Indenture, any of the Notes shall have been authenticated but
not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of
authentication of any predecessor trustee or authenticating agent appointed by
such predecessor trustee, and deliver such Notes so authenticated; and in
case at that time any of the Notes shall not have been authenticated, any
successor to the Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by such
successor trustee may authenticate such Notes either in the name of any
predecessor trustee hereunder or in the name of the successor trustee; and in
all such cases such certificates shall have the full force which it is
anywhere in the Notes or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of
the Trustee shall have; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to adopt the
certificate of authentication of any predecessor trustee or to authenticate
Notes in the name of any predecessor trustee shall apply only to its successor
or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.

Section 7.12 _Trustee_ __ _s Application for Instructions from the Company_.
Any application by the Trustee for written instructions from the Company
(other than with regard to any action proposed to be taken or omitted to be
taken by the Trustee that affects the rights of the Holders of the Notes under
this Indenture) may, at the option of the Trustee, set forth in writing any
action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Trustee under this Indenture and
the date on and/or after which such action shall be taken or such omission
shall be effective. The Trustee shall not be liable to the Company for any
action taken by, or omission of, the Trustee in accordance with a proposal
included in such application on or after the date specified in such
application (which date shall not be less than three (3) Business Days after
the date any officer that the Company has indicated to the Trustee should
receive such application actually receives such application, unless any such
officer shall have consented in writing to any earlier date), unless, prior
to taking any such action (or the effective date in the case of any
omission), the Trustee shall have received written instructions in accordance
with this Indenture in response to such application specifying the action to
be taken or omitted.

 

ARTICLE 8

CONCERNING THE HOLDERS 

Section 8.01 _Action by Holders_. Whenever in this Indenture it is provided
that the Holders of a specified percentage of the aggregate principal amount
of the Notes may take any action (including the making of any demand or
request, the giving of any notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any
other action), the fact that at the time of taking any such action,
the Holders of such specified percentage have joined therein may be evidenced
(a) by any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed
by Holders in person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing, or (b) by the
record of the Holders voting in favor thereof at any meeting of Holders duly
called and held in accordance with the provisions of Article 9, or (c) by a
combination of such instrument or instruments and any such record of such a
meeting of Holders. Whenever the Company or the Trustee solicits the taking
of any action by the Holders of the Notes, the Company or the Trustee may, but
shall not be required to, fix in advance of such solicitation, a date as the
record date for determining Holders entitled to take such action. The record
date if one is selected shall be not more than fifteen days prior to the date
of commencement of solicitation of such action.

 



43

    

Section 8.02 _Proof of Execution by Holders_. Subject to the provisions
of Section 7.01, Section 7.02 and Section 9.05, proof of the execution of any
instrument by a Holder or its agent or proxy shall be sufficient if made in
accordance with such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by
the Trustee or in such manner as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee. The
holding of Notes shall be proved by the Note Register or by a certificate of
the Note Registrar. The record of any Holders meeting shall be proved in the
manner provided in Section 9.06.

Section 8.03 _Who Are Deemed Absolute Owners_. The Company, the Trustee, any
authenticating agent, any Paying Agent, any Conversion Agent and any Note
Registrar may deem the Person in whose name a Note shall be registered upon
the Note Register to be, and may treat it as, the absolute owner of such Note
(whether or not such Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation
of ownership or other writing thereon made by any Person other than the
Company or any Note Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on
account of the principal (including any Fundamental Change Repurchase Price)
of and (subject to Section 2.03) accrued and unpaid interest on such Note, for
conversion of such Note and for all other purposes; and neither the Company
nor the Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor any Conversion Agent nor any
Note Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. The sole
registered holder of a Global Note shall be the Depositary or its nominee. All
such payments or deliveries so made to any Holder for the time being, or upon
its order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sums or shares of Common
Stock so paid or delivered, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability
for monies payable or shares deliverable upon any such Note. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Indenture or the Notes following an Event of
Default, any holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Note may directly
enforce against the Company, without the consent, solicitation, proxy,
authorization or any other action of the Depositary or any other Person, such
holders right to exchange such beneficial interest for a Note in certificated
form in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.

 

Section 8.04 _Company-Owned Notes Disregarded_. In determining whether the
Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Notes have concurred
in any direction, consent, waiver or other action under this Indenture, Notes
that are owned by the Company, by any Subsidiary thereof or by any Affiliate
of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof shall be disregarded and deemed not
to be outstanding for the purpose of any such determination; provided that for
the purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying
on any such direction, consent, waiver or other action only Notes that a
Responsible Officer actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.
Notes so owned that have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as
outstanding for the purposes of this Section 8.04 if the pledgee shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgees right to so act
with respect to such Notes and that the pledgee is not the Company, a
Subsidiary thereof or an Affiliate of the Company or a Subsidiary thereof. In
the case of a dispute as to such right, any decision by the Trustee taken
upon the advice of counsel shall be full protection to the Trustee. Upon
request of the Trustee, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee promptly an
Officers Certificate listing and identifying all Notes, if any, known by the
Company to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above
described Persons; and, subject to Section 7.01, the Trustee shall be entitled
to accept such Officers Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts
therein set forth and of the fact that all Notes not listed therein are
outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.

Section 8.05  _Revocation of Consents; Future Holders Bound_. At any time
prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section
8.01, of the taking of any action by the Holders of the percentage of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes specified in this Indenture in
connection with such action, any Holder of a Note that is shown by the
evidence to be included in the Notes the Holders of which have consented to
such action may, by filing written notice with the Trustee at its Corporate
Trust Office and upon proof of holding as provided in Section 8.02, revoke
such action so far as concerns such Note. Except as aforesaid, any such action
taken by the Holder of any Note shall be 

 



44

    

 conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and
owners of such Note and of any Notes issued in exchange or substitution
therefor or upon registration of transfer thereof, irrespective of whether
any notation in regard thereto is made upon such Note or any Note issued in
exchange or substitution therefor or upon registration of transfer thereof.

that no vote shall be cast or counted at any meeting in respect of any Note

48

    

Holders do not need under this Section 10.02 to approve the particular form of
any proposed supplemental indenture. It shall be sufficient if such Holders
approve the substance thereof. After any such supplemental indenture becomes

with or into, or sell, convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of
the consolidated assets of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, to another Person, unless:

 

(a) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the "Successor Company"),
if not the Company, shall be a corporation organized and existing under the
laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of
Columbia, and the Successor Company (if not the Company) shall expressly
assume, by supplemental indenture all of the obligations of the Company under
the Notes and this Indenture;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing under this Indenture; and

 



49

    

(c) if the Company is not the Successor Company, the Successor Company shall
have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and Opinion of
Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance,
transfer or lease complies with this Indenture and that such supplemental
indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture and an Opinion of
Counsel stating that the supplemental indenture is the valid and binding
obligation of the Successor Company, subject to customary exceptions and

assumption by the Successor Company (if other than the Company), by
supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory

and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the Notes, the due and punctual
delivery and/or payment, as the case may be, of any consideration due upon
conversion of the Notes and the due and punctual performance of all of the
covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the Company,
such Successor Company (if not the Company) shall succeed to and, except in
the case of a lease of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of
the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall be
substituted for the Company, with the same effect as if it had been named
herein as the party of the first part, and the Company shall be discharged
from its obligations under the Notes and this Indenture (except in the case
of a lease of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the
Company and the Companys Subsidiaries, taken as a whole). Such Successor
Company thereupon may cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name
or in the name of the Company any or all of the Notes issuable hereunder
which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to
the Trustee; and, upon the order of such Successor Company instead of the
Company and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in this
Indenture prescribed, the Trustee shall authenticate and shall deliver, or
cause to be authenticated and delivered, any Notes that previously shall have
been signed and delivered by the Officers of the Company to the Trustee for
authentication, and any Notes that such Successor Company thereafter shall
cause to be signed and delivered to the Trustee for that purpose. All the
Notes so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit
under this Indenture as the Notes theretofore or thereafter issued in
accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Notes had
been issued at the date of the execution hereof. In the event of any such
consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance or transfer (but not in the case of a
lease), upon compliance with this Article 11 the Person named as the "Company"
in the first paragraph of this Indenture (or any successor that shall
thereafter have become such in the manner prescribed in this Article 11) may
be dissolved, wound up and liquidated at any time thereafter and, except in
the case of a lease, such Person shall be released from its liabilities as
obligor and maker of the Notes and from its obligations under this Indenture
and the Notes.

In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, transfer
or lease, such changes in phraseology and form (but not in substance) may be
made in the Notes thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate.

 

Section 11.03 _Opinion of Counsel to Be Given to Trustee_. If a supplemental
indenture is required pursuant to this Article 11, no such consolidation,
merger, sale, conveyance, transfer or lease shall be effective unless the
Trustee shall receive an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as
conclusive evidence that any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance,
transfer or lease and any such assumption complies with the provisions of this
Article 11\.

ARTICLE 14

 

CONVERSION OF NOTES

 

Section 14.01 _Conversion Privilege_. Subject to and upon compliance with the
provisions of this Article 14, each Holder of a Note shall have the right, at
such Holders option, to convert all or any portion (if the portion to be
converted is $1,000 principal amount or an integral multiple thereof) of such
Note at any time prior to the close of business on the second Scheduled
Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, at an initial conversion
rate of 86.9565 shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustment as provided in
this Article 14, the "Conversion Rate") per $1,000 principal amount of Notes
(subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of Section
14.02, the "Conversion Obligation").

 

Section 14.02 _Conversion Procedure; Settlement Upon Conversion_.

 

(a) Subject to this Section 14.02 and Section 14.07(a), upon conversion of any
Note, the Company shall pay or deliver, as the case may be, to the converting
Holder no later than two (2) Trading Days following the applicable conversion
of the Notes, in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of Notes being
converted, shares of Common Stock, together with cash, if applicable, in lieu
of delivering any fractional share of Common Stock in accordance with
subsection (j) of this Section 14.02 ("Physical Settlement") as set forth in
this Section 14.02. The Company shall use the Physical Settlement Method for
all conversions.

(i) The shares of Common Stock in respect of any conversion of Notes
(the "Settlement Amount") shall be computed as follows: (A) the Company shall
deliver to the converting Holder in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of
Notes being converted a number of shares of Common Stock equal to
the Conversion Rate in effect on the Conversion Date (plus cash in lieu of
any fractional share of Common Stock issuable upon conversion) plus (B)(x) if
the average of the Daily VWAPs for the 10 Trading Days immediately preceding
the Conversion Date (the "Average VWAP") equals or exceeds $11.50 per share,
the Company shall, in its sole discretion, deliver to the Holder the Interest
Make-Whole Amount for such conversion in the form of cash or a number of
shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Interest Make-Whole Amount
by the Average Price VWAP and delivering cash in lieu of fractional shares or
(y) if the Average VWAP is less than $11.50 per share, the Company shall
deliver to the Holder the Interest Make-Whole Amount for such conversion
solely in the form of cash.

(b) Subject to Section 14.02(e), before any Holder of a Note shall be
entitled to convert a Note as set forth above, such Holder shall (i) in the
case of a Global Note, comply with the procedures of the Depositary in effect
at that time and, if required, pay funds equal to the interest payable on the
next Interest Payment Date to which such Holder is not entitled as set forth
in Section 14.02(h) and, if

 



51

    

 required, pay all transfer or similar taxes, if any, pursuant to Section
14.02(e) and (ii) in the case of a Physical Note (1) complete, manually sign
and deliver an irrevocable notice to the Conversion Agent as set forth in the
Form of Notice of Conversion (or a facsimile thereof) (a "Notice of
Conversion") at the office of the Conversion Agent and state in writing
therein the principal amount of Notes to be converted and the name or names
(with addresses) in which such Holder wishes the certificate or certificates
for any shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon settlement of the
Conversion Obligation to be registered, (2) surrender such Notes, duly
endorsed to the Company or in blank (and accompanied by appropriate
endorsement and transfer documents), at the office of the Conversion Agent,
(3) if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, (4)
if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next Interest Payment
Date to which such Holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 14.02(h) and
(5) if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes, if any, pursuant
to Section 14.02(e). The Trustee (and if different, the Conversion Agent)
shall notify the Company of any conversion pursuant to this Article 14 on the
Conversion Date for such conversion. No Notice of Conversion with respect to
any Notes may be surrendered by a Holder thereof if such Holder has also
delivered a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice to the Company in respect of
such Notes and has not validly withdrawn such Fundamental Change Repurchase
Notice in accordance with Section 15.03. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, to the extent that an indirect holder of a Global
Note held indirectly through a participant submits irrevocable instructions to
convert any portion of such Note, such Holder shall be deemed for purposes of
Regulation SHO to have converted the applicable portion of such Note at the
time of delivery of such instructions, regardless of when shares of Common
Stock are delivered to such Holder or its participant.

 

If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the
same Holder, the Conversion Obligation with respect to such Notes shall be
computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or
specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered.

 

(c) A Note shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the
close of business on the date (the "Conversion Date") that the Holder has
complied with the requirements set forth in subsection (b) above. Except as
set forth in Section 14.07(a), the Company shall pay or deliver, as the case
may be, the consideration due in respect of the Conversion Obligation on the
second Business Day immediately following the relevant Conversion Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the Companys satisfaction of
its Conversion Obligation through Physical Settlement for which the relevant
Conversion Date occurs after the Regular Record Date immediately preceding the
Maturity Date, the settlement shall occur on the Maturity Date. If any shares
of Common Stock are due to a converting Holder, the Company shall issue
or cause to be issued, and deliver (if applicable) to the Conversion Agent or
to such Holder, or such Holders nominee or nominees, the full number of
shares of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled, in book-entry
format through the Depositary, in satisfaction of the Companys Conversion
Obligation.

(d) In case any Note shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company
shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon the
written order of the Holder of the Note so surrendered a new Note or Notes in
authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unconverted portion of the surrendered Note, without payment of any service
charge by the converting Holder but, if required by the Company or Trustee,
with payment of a sum sufficient to cover any documentary, stamp or similar
issue or transfer tax or similar governmental charge required by law or that
may be imposed in connection therewith as a result of the name of the Holder
of the new Notes issued upon such conversion being different from the name of
the Holder of the old Notes surrendered for such conversion.

 



52

    

(e) If a Holder submits a Note for conversion, the Company shall pay any
documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of any
shares of Common Stock upon conversion, unless the tax is due because the
Holder requests such shares to be issued in a name other than the Holders
name, in which case the Holder shall pay that tax. The Conversion Agent may
refuse to deliver the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock
being issued in a name other than the Holders name until the Trustee receives
a sum sufficient to pay any tax that is due by such Holder in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence.

(f) Except as provided in Section 14.04, no adjustment shall be made for
dividends on any shares of Common Stock issued upon the conversion of any Note
as provided in this Article 14\.

(g) Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Note, the Trustee, or the
Custodian at the direction of the Trustee, shall make a notation on such
Global Note as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby.
The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversion of Notes
effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.

(h) Upon conversion, a Holder shall not receive any separate cash payment for
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, except as set forth below. The Companys
settlement of the full Conversion Obligation shall be deemed to satisfy in
full its obligation to pay the principal amount of the Note and accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the relevant Conversion Date. As a
result, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the relevant
Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled,
extinguished or forfeited. Upon a conversion of Notes into shares of Common
Stock, accrued and unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid first out of the
cash paid upon such conversion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Notes
are converted after the close of business on a Regular Record Date but prior
to the open of business on the immediately following Interest Payment Date,
Holders of such Notes as of the close of business on such Regular Record Date
will receive the full amount of interest payable on such Notes on such
Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion. However, Notes
surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any
Regular Record Date to the open of business on the immediately following
Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by funds equal to the amount of
interest payable on the Notes so converted on the corresponding Interest
Payment Date (regardless of whether the converting Holder was the Holder
of record on the corresponding Regular Record Date); _provided_ that no such
payment shall be required (1) for conversions following the close of business
on the Regular Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date; (2) if
the Company has specified a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date that is after
a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the Business Day immediately
following the corresponding Interest Payment Date and a conversion occurs
after such Regular Record Date and on or prior to the open of business on
such Interest Payment Date; or (3) to the extent of any Defaulted Amounts, if
any Defaulted Amounts exist at the time of conversion with respect to such
Note. Therefore, for the avoidance of doubt, all Holders of record on the
Regular Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date and any
Fundamental Change Repurchase Date described in clause (2) above shall receive
the full interest payment due on the Maturity Date or other
applicable Interest Payment Date in cash regardless of whether their Notes
have been converted and/or repurchased, as applicable, following such Regular
Record Date.

 

(i) The Person in whose name the shares of Common Stock shall be issuable upon
conversion shall be treated as a stockholder of record as of the close of
business on the relevant Conversion Date. Upon a conversion of Notes, such
Person shall no longer be a Holder of such Notes surrendered for conversion.

 

(j) The Company shall not issue any fractional share of Common Stock upon
conversion of the Notes and shall instead pay cash in lieu of delivering any
fractional share of Common Stock issuable upon conversion based on the Daily
VWAP for the relevant Conversion Date.

 



53

    

Section 14.03 _Company_ __ _s Mandatory Conversion Option_.

 

(a) On or after [ ], 2022 and prior to the close of business
on the second Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date,
the Company may, at its option, elect to convert the Original Principal Amount
of the Notes in whole but not in part (x) if the Last Reported Sale Price
of the Common Stock for at least 20 Trading Days (whether or not consecutive)
during the period of 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on, and including, the
last Trading Day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than
or equal to 120% of the Conversion Price on each applicable Trading Day and
(y) if the 30-Day ADTV ending on, and including, the last Trading Day of the
applicable exercise period is greater than or equal to $3,000,000 (the
"Company Mandatory Conversion Condition").

(b) To exercise the Company Mandatory Conversion Right, the Company will send
notice of the Companys election (a "Mandatory Conversion Notice") to Holders,
the Trustee and the Conversion Agent no later than the fifth (5th) Business
Day after the last VWAP Trading Day of such 30 consecutive VWAP Trading Day
period.

Such Mandatory Conversion Notice must state:

 

(i) that the Notes have been called for Mandatory Conversion, briefly
describing the Company Mandatory Conversion Right under this Indenture; 

(ii) the Mandatory Conversion Date;

 

(iii) the current Conversion Rate;

 

(iv) the Interest Make-Whole amount;

 

(v) the name and address of the Paying Agent and the Conversion Agent; and

 

(vi) the CUSIP and ISIN numbers, if any, of the Notes

 

(c) If the Company exercises the Company Mandatory Conversion Right in
accordance with this Section 14.03, then a Conversion Date
will automatically, and without the need for any action on the part of any
Holder, the Trustee or the Conversion Agent, be deemed to occur, with respect
to each Note then outstanding, on the Mandatory Conversion Date. The Mandatory
Conversion Date will be a Business Day of the Companys choosing that is no
more than thirty (30), nor less than ten (10), Business Days after the Company
sends the Mandatory Conversion Notice.

 

(d) Each share of Common Stock delivered upon a Mandatory Conversion of any
Note will be a newly issued or treasury share and will be duly and validly
issued, fully paid, non-assessable, free from preemptive rights and free of
any lien or adverse claim. If the Common Stock is then listed on any
securities exchange, or quoted on any inter-dealer quotation system, and has
been registered on an effective registration statement with the Commission,
then the Company will cause each shares of Common Stock, when delivered upon a
Mandatory Conversion of any Note, to be admitted for listing on such exchange
or quotation on such system. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Company shall not be permitted to effect any Company Mandatory Conversion
hereunder unless as of such Mandatory Conversion Date no Equity Conditions
Failure then exists.

 



54

    

Section 14.04 _Adjustment of Conversion Rate_. The Conversion Rate shall
be adjusted from time to time by the Company if any of the following events
occurs, except that the Company shall not make any adjustments to the
Conversion Rate if Holders of the Notes participate (other than in the case of
(x) a share split or share combination or (y) a tender or exchange offer), at
the same time and upon the same terms as holders of the Common Stock and
solely as a result of holding the Notes, in any of the transactions described
in this Section 14.04, without having to convert their Notes, as if they held
a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate, multiplied by
the principal amount (expressed in thousands) of Notes held by such Holder.

 

(a) If the Company exclusively issues shares of Common Stock as a dividend or
distribution on shares of the Common Stock, or if the Company effects a share
split or share combination, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the
following formula:



   ![LOGO](g87498g1210134023976.jpg) 

where,



   CR0 = |

the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the open of business on
the Ex-Dividend Date of such dividend or distribution, or immediately prior
to the open of business on the Effective Date of such share split or share
combination, as applicable; 

---|--- 
 



   CR = |

the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the open of business on
such Ex-Dividend Date or Effective Date, as applicable; 

---|--- 



   OS0 = |

the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the open
of business on such Ex-Dividend Date or Effective Date, as applicable, before
giving effect to such dividend, distribution, share split or share
combination; and 

---|--- 
 



   OS = |

the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving
effect to such dividend, distribution, share split or share combination. 

---|--- 

Any adjustment made under this Section 14.04(a) shall become effective
immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such
dividend or distribution, or immediately after the open of business on the
Effective Date for such share split or share combination, as applicable. If
any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 14.04(a) is
declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately
readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to
pay such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be
in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.

(b) If the Company issues to all or substantially all holders of the Common
Stock any rights, options or warrants (other than pursuant to a stockholders
rights plan) entitling them, for a period of not more than 45 calendar days
after the announcement date of such issuance, to subscribe for or purchase
shares of the Common Stock at a price per share that is less than the average
of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive
Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately
preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, the Conversion Rate shall
be increased based on the following formula:



 

   ![LOGO](g87498g1210134024975.jpg) 

 



55

    

where,



   CR0 = |

the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the open of business on
the Ex-Dividend Date for such issuance; 

---|--- 



   CR = |

the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the open of business on
such Ex-Dividend Date; 

---|--- 



   OS0 = |

the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the open
of business on such Ex-Dividend Date; 

---|--- 



   X = |

the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights,
options or warrants; and  

---|--- 



   Y = |

the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate price payable to
exercise such rights, options or warrants, _divided by_ the average of the
Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading
Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the
date of announcement of the issuance of such rights, options or warrants. 

---|--- 

Any increase made under this Section 14.04(b) shall be made successively
whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become
effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for
such issuance. To the extent that shares of the Common Stock are not delivered
after the expiration of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate
shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the
increase with respect to the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been
made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock
actually delivered. If such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the
Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be
in effect if such Ex-Dividend Date for such issuance had not occurred.

For purposes of this Section 14.04(b), in determining whether any rights,
options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of
the Common Stock at a price per share that is less than such average of the
Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading
Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the
date of announcement for such issuance, and in determining the aggregate
offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken
into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights,
options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof,
the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the
Board of Directors.

 

(c) If the Company distributes shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of its
Indebtedness, other assets or property of the Company or rights, options or
warrants to acquire its Capital Stock or other securities, to all or
substantially all holders of the Common Stock, excluding (i) dividends,
distributions or issuances (including share splits) as to which an adjustment
was effected pursuant to Section 14.04(a), Section 14.04(b) or Section
14.04(e), (ii) except as otherwise described in Section 14.11, rights issued
pursuant to any stockholders rights plan of the Company then in effect,
(iii)dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash as to which the
provisions set forth in Section 14.04(d) shall apply, (iv) dividends or
distributions of Reference Property in exchange for or upon conversion of the
Common Stock in a Share Exchange Event, and (v) Spin-Offs as to which the
provisions set forth below in this Section 14.04(c) shall apply (any of such
shares of Capital Stock, evidences of Indebtedness, other assets or property
or rights, options or warrants to acquire Capital Stock or other securities,
the "Distributed Property"), then the Conversion Rate shall be increased based
on the following formula:

 



56

    

   ![LOGO](g87498g1210134024288.jpg) 

where,



        |  |   |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
    CR0 |  | = |  | the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior
to the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; 
   |  | 
  CR |  | = |  | the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the
open of business on such Ex-Dividend Date; 
   |  | 
  SP0 |  | = |  | the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the
Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and
including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for
such distribution; and 
   |  | 
  FMV |  | = |  | the fair market value (as determined by the Board of
Directors) of the Distributed Property with respect to each outstanding share
of the Common Stock on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. 
 

Any increase made under the portion of this Section 14.04(c) above shall
become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend
Date for such distribution. If such distribution is not so paid or made, the
Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be
in effect if such distribution had not been declared. If the Company issues
rights, options or warrants to acquire Capital Stock or other securities that
are exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, the
Company shall not adjust the conversion rate pursuant to the clauses above
until the earliest of these triggering events occurs. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if "FMV" (as defined above) is equal to or greater than "SP0" (as
defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder of a Note
shall receive, in respect of each $1,000 principal amount thereof, at the same
time and upon the same terms as holders of the Common Stock receive the
Distributed Property, the amount and kind of Distributed Property such Holder
would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock
equal to the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the open of
business on the Ex-Dividend Date for the distribution. If the Board of
Directors determines the "FMV" (as defined above) of any distribution for
purposes of this Section 14.04(c) by reference to the actual or when-issued
trading market for any securities, it shall in doing so consider the prices
in such market over the same period used in computing the Last Reported Sale
Prices of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending
on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date
for such distribution.

With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 14.04(c) where there
has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock of
shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of
or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company, that are,
or, when issued, will be, listed or admitted for trading on a U.S. national
securities exchange (a "Spin-Off"), the Conversion Rate shall be increased
based on the following formula:



   ![LOGO](g87498g1210134025287.jpg) 

where,

CR0 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the end of the
Valuation Period;

 



57

            |  |   |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
    CR |  | = |  |

the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the end of the Valuation
Period; 

   |  | 
  FMV0 |  | = |  |

the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Capital Stock or similar
equity interest distributed to holders of the Common Stock applicable to one
share of the Common Stock (determined by reference to the definition of Last
Reported Sale Price as set forth in Section 1.01 as if references therein to
Common Stock were to such Capital Stock or similar equity interest) over the
first 10 consecutive Trading Day period after, and including, the Ex-Dividend
Date of the Spin-Off (the "Valuation Period"); and 

   |  | 
  MP0 |  | = |  |

the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the
Valuation Period. 

 

The increase to the Conversion Rate under the preceding paragraph shall occur
at the close of business on the last Trading Day of the Valuation Period;
_provided_ that if the relevant Conversion Date occurs during the Valuation
Period, references to "10" in the preceding paragraph shall be deemed to be
replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the
Ex-Dividend Date of such Spin-Off and the Conversion Date in determining the
Conversion Rate. If any dividend or distribution that constitutes a Spin-Off
is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately
decreased, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to
pay or make such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would
then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared or
announced.

 

For purposes of this Section 14.04(c) (and subject in all respect to Section
14.11), rights, options or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders
of the Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of the
Companys Capital Stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under
certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until
the occurrence of a specified event or events ("Trigger Event"): (i) are
deemed to be transferred with such shares of the Common Stock; (ii) are not
exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of
the Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes
of this Section 14.04(c) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this
Section 14.04(c) will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest
Trigger Event, whereupon such rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to
have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to
the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 14.04(c). If any such
right, option or warrant, including any such existing rights, options or
warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to
events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants become
exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of Indebtedness or
other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall
be deemed to be the date of distribution and Ex-Dividend Date with respect to
new rights, options or warrants with such rights (in which case the existing
rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to terminate and expire on such
date without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the
event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or
warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the
immediately preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for
purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the
Conversion Rate under this Section 14.04(c) was made, (1) in the case of any
such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or
purchased without exercise by any holders thereof, upon such final redemption
or purchase (x) the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights,
options or warrants had not been issued and the Conversion Rate shall then
again be readjusted to give effect to such distribution, deemed distribution
or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution,
equal to the per share redemption or purchase price received by a holder or
holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants
(assuming such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to
all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or purchase, and
(2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or
been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate
shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been
issued.

 



58

    

For purposes of Section 14.04(a), Section 14.04(b) and this Section
14.04(c), if any dividend or distribution to which this Section 14.04(c) is
applicable also includes one or both of:

(A) a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which Section
14.04(a) is applicable (the "Clause A Distribution"); or

(B) a dividend or distribution of rights, options or warrants to which
Section 14.04(b) is applicable (the "Clause B Distribution"),

 

then, in either case, (1) such dividend or distribution, other than the Clause
A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution, shall be deemed to be
a dividend or distribution to which this Section 14.04(c) is applicable (the
"Clause C Distribution") and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this
Section 14.04(c) with respect to such Clause C Distribution shall then be
made, and (2) the Clause A Distribution and Clause B Distribution shall be
deemed to immediately follow the Clause C Distribution and any Conversion Rate
adjustment required by Section 14.04(a) and Section 14.04(b) with
respect thereto shall then be made, except that, if determined by the Company
(I) the "Ex-Dividend Date" of the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B
Distribution shall be deemed to be the Ex-Dividend Date of the Clause C
Distribution and (II) any shares of Common Stock included in the Clause A
Distribution or Clause B Distribution shall be deemed not to be "outstanding
immediately prior to the open of business on such Ex-Dividend Date or
Effective Date" within the meaning of Section 14.04(a) or "outstanding
immediately prior to the open of business on such Ex-Dividend Date" within the
meaning of Section 14.04(b).

(d) If the Company pays or makes any cash dividend or distribution to all or
substantially all holders of the Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be
adjusted based on the following formula:



 

   ![LOGO](g87498g1210134024569.jpg) 

where,



        |  |   |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
    CR0 |  | = |  |

the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the
Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution; 

   |  | 
  CR |  | = |  |

the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the open of business on the
Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution; 

   |  | 
  SP0 |  | = |  |

the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day
immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution;
and 

   |  | 
  C |  | = |  |

the amount in cash per share the Company distributes to all or substantially
all holders of the Common Stock. 

 

Any increase pursuant to this Section 14.04(d) shall become effective
immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such
dividend or distribution. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid, the
Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date the Board of
Directors determines not to make or pay such dividend or distribution, to be
the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or
distribution had not been declared. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "C" (as
defined

 



59

    

above) is equal to or greater than "SP0" (as defined above), in lieu of the
foregoing increase, each Holder of a Note shall receive, for each $1,000
principal amount of Notes, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders
of shares of the Common Stock, the amount of cash that such Holder would have
received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the
Conversion Rate on the Ex-Dividend Date for such cash dividend or
distribution.

 

(e) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries make a payment in respect of a
tender or exchange offer for the Common Stock that is subject to the then-
applicable tender offer rules under the Exchange Act (other than an odd lot
tender offer), to the extent that the cash and value of any other
consideration included in the payment per share of the Common Stock exceeds
the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the 10
consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day
next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made
pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, the Conversion Rate shall be
increased based on the following formula:



   ![LOGO](g87498g1210134025599.jpg) 

where,



        |  |   |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
    CR0 |  | = |  |

the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on
the 10th Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Trading Day
next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires (the date such
tender offer or exchange offer expires, the "Expiration Date"); 

   |  | 
  CR |  | = |  |

the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the close of business on the
10th Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Trading Day next
succeeding the Expiration Date; 

   |  | 
  AC |  | = |  |

the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined by
the Board of Directors) paid or payable for shares of Common Stock purchased
in such tender or exchange offer; 

   |  | 
  OS0 |  | = |  |

the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Expiration Date (prior to giving effect to the purchase of all shares of
Common Stock accepted for purchase or exchange in such tender or exchange
offer); 

   |  | 
  OS |  | = |  |

the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the
Expiration Date (after giving effect to the purchase of all shares of Common
Stock accepted for purchase or exchange in such tender or exchange offer); and
SP = the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over
the 10 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the
Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date. 

 

The increase to the Conversion Rate under this Section 14.04(e) shall occur at
the close of business on the 10th Trading Day immediately following, and
including, the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange
offer expires; _provided_ that if the relevant Conversion Date occurs during
the 10 Trading Days immediately following, and including, the Trading Day
next succeeding the Expiration Date of any tender or exchange offer,
references to "10" or "10th" in the preceding paragraph shall be deemed
replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the
Expiration Date of such tender or exchange offer and the Conversion Date in
determining the Conversion Rate. In addition, if the Trading Day next
succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires is after the 10th
Trading Day immediately preceding, and including, the date immediately

 



60

    

 preceding the relevant Conversion Date in respect of a conversion of Notes,
references to "10" or "10th" in the preceding paragraph and this paragraph
shall be deemed to be replaced, solely in respect of that conversion of
Notes, with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and
including, the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange
offer expires to, and including, the last Trading Day immediately preceding
the relevant Conversion Date.

In the event that the Company or one of its Subsidiaries is obligated to
purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange
offer, but the Company is, or such Subsidiary is, permanently prevented by
applicable law from consummating any such purchases, or all such purchases are
rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to be the Conversion
Rate that would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had
not been made or had been made only in respect of the purchases that have been
consummated.

 

(f) Notwithstanding this Section 14.04 or any other provision of this
Indenture or the Notes, if a Conversion Rate adjustment becomes effective on
any Ex-Dividend Date, and a Holder that has converted its Notes on or after
such Ex-Dividend Date and on or prior to the related Record Date would
be treated as the record holder of the shares of Common Stock as of the
related Conversion Date as described under Section 14.02(i) based on an
adjusted Conversion Rate for such Ex-Dividend Date, then, notwithstanding the
Conversion Rate adjustment provisions in this Section 14.04, the Conversion
Rate adjustment relating to such Ex-Dividend Date shall not be made for such
converting Holder. Instead, such Holder shall be treated as if such Holder
were the record owner of the shares of Common Stock on an unadjusted basis and
participate in the related dividend, distribution or other event giving rise
to such adjustment.

 

(g) Except as stated herein, the Company shall not adjust the Conversion Rate
for the issuance of shares of the Common Stock or any securities convertible
into or exchangeable for shares of the Common Stock or the right to purchase
shares of the Common Stock or such convertible or exchangeable securities.

 

(h) In addition to those adjustments required by clauses (a), (b), (c), (d)
and (e) of this Section 14.04, and to the extent permitted by applicable law
and subject to the applicable rules of The New York Stock Exchange, the
Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a
period of at least 20 Business Days if the Board of Directors determines that
such increase would be in the Companys best interest. In addition, to the
extent permitted by applicable law and subject to the applicable rules of The
New York Stock Exchange, the Company may (but is not required to)
increase the Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders
of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock in connection with a
dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock (or rights to acquire
shares of Common Stock) or similar event. Whenever the Conversion Rate is
increased pursuant to either of the preceding two sentences, the Company shall
deliver to the Holder of each Note a notice of the increase at least 15 days
prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice
shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will
be in effect.

(i) Except as stated in this Indenture, the Company shall not adjust the
Conversion Rate for the issuance of shares of Common Stock or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock or the right to
purchase shares of Common Stock or such convertible or exchangeable
securities. For illustrative purposes only and without limiting the generality
of the preceding sentence, the Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted:

 

(i) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or
future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable
on the Companys securities and the investment of additional optional amounts
in shares of Common Stock under any plan;

 



61

    

(ii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights
to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director
or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of
the Companys Subsidiaries;

 

(iii) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any
option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security
not described in clause (ii) of this subsection and outstanding as of the date
the Notes were first issued;

 

(iv) upon the repurchase of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to an open
market share repurchase program or other buy-back transaction, including
structured or derivative transactions, that is not a tender or exchange offer
of the nature described in Section 14.04(e);

 

(v) solely for a change in the par value (or lack of par value) of the Common
Stock; or

 

(vi) for accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

 

(j) All calculations and other determinations under this Article 14 shall be
made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest one-ten thousandth
(1/10,000th) of a share.

(k) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company
shall promptly deliver to the Trustee (and the Conversion Agent if not the
Trustee) an Officers Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such
adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such
adjustment. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have
received such Officers Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have
knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume
without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is
still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company
shall prepare a written notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate
setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each
adjustment becomes effective and shall deliver such notice of such adjustment
of the Conversion Rate to each Holder (with a copy to the Trustee). Failure to
deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such
adjustment.

(l) For purposes of this Section 14.04, the number of shares of Common Stock
at any time outstanding shall not include shares of Common Stock held in the
treasury of the Company so long as the Company does not pay any dividend or
make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the
Company, but shall include shares of Common Stock issuable in respect of
scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.

 

Section 14.05 _Adjustments of Prices_. Whenever any provision of this
Indenture requires the Company to calculate the Last Reported Sale Prices or
the Daily VWAPs over a span of multiple days, the Board of Directors shall
make appropriate adjustments (without duplication in respect of any adjustment
made pursuant to Section 14.04) to each to account for any adjustment to the
Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment
to the Conversion Rate where the Ex-Dividend Date, Effective Date or
Expiration Date, as the case may be, of the event occurs, at any time during
the period when the Last Reported Sale Prices or the Daily VWAPs are to be
calculated.

 



62

    

Section 14.06 _Shares to Be Fully Paid_. The Company shall reserve, free
from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares
held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for conversion
of the Notes from time to time as such Notes are presented for conversion.

 

Section 14.07 _Effect of Recapitalizations, Reclassifications and Changes of
the Common Stock_.

 

(a) In the case of:

 

(i) any recapitalization, reclassification or change of the Common Stock
(other than changes in par value or resulting from a subdivision or
combination),

(ii) any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction involving
the Company, 

(iii) any sale, lease or other transfer to a third party of all or
substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or

(iv) any statutory share exchange,

 

in each case, as a result of which the Common Stock would be converted into,
or exchanged for, stock, other securities, other property or assets
(including cash or any combination thereof) (any such event, a "Share
Exchange Event"), then at and after the effective time of such Share Exchange
Event, the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Notes shall be
changed into a right to convert such principal amount of Notes into the kind
and amount of shares of stock, other securities or other property or assets
(including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of a number of
shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such
Share Exchange Event would have owned or been entitled to receive (the
"Reference Property," with each "unit of Reference Property" meaning the kind
and amount of Reference Property that a holder of one share of Common Stock
is entitled to receive) upon such Share Exchange Event and, prior to or at the
effective time of such Share Exchange Event, the Company or the successor or
acquiring Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a
supplemental indenture permitted under Section 10.01(g) providing for such
change in the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Notes;
_provided_ , _however_ , that at and after the effective time of the Share
Exchange Event (A) the Company or the successor or acquiring company, as the
case may be, shall continue to have the right to determine the form of
consideration to be paid or delivered, as the case may be, upon conversion
of Notes in accordance with Section 14.02 and (B) (I) any amount payable in
cash upon conversion of the Notes in accordance with Section 14.02 shall
continue to be payable in cash, (II) any shares of Common Stock that the
Company would have been required to deliver upon conversion of the Notes in
accordance with Section 14.02 shall instead be deliverable in the amount and
type of Reference Property that a holder of that number of shares of Common
Stock would have been entitled to receive in such Share Exchange Event and
(III) the Daily VWAP shall be calculated based on the value of a unit of
Reference Property.

 

If the Share Exchange Event causes the Common Stock to be converted into, or
exchanged for, the right to receive more than a single type of consideration
(determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election), then (i) the
Reference Property into which the Notes will be convertible shall be deemed to
be (x) the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration
received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an
election or (y) if no holders of Common Stock affirmatively make such an
election, the types and amounts of consideration actually received by the
holders of Common Stock, and (ii) the unit of Reference Property for purposes
of the immediately preceding paragraph shall refer to the consideration
referred to in clause (i) attributable to one share of Common Stock. If the
holders of the Common Stock receive only cash in such Share Exchange Event,
then for all conversions for which the relevant Conversion Date occurs after
the effective date of such

 



63

    

 Share Exchange Event (A) the consideration due upon conversion of each
$1,000 principal amount of Notes shall be solely cash in an amount equal to
the Conversion Rate in effect on the Conversion Date, _multiplied by_ the
price paid per share of Common Stock in such Share Exchange Event and (B) the
Company shall satisfy the Conversion Obligation by paying such cash amount to
converting Holders on the second Business Day immediately following the
relevant Conversion Date. The Company shall notify in writing Holders, the
Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) of such weighted
average as soon as reasonably practicable after such determination is made.

If the Reference Property in respect of any Share Exchange Event includes, in
whole or in part, shares of common equity, such supplemental indenture
described in the second immediately preceding paragraph shall provide for
anti-dilution and other adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as is
possible to the adjustments provided for in this Article 14 with respect to
the portion of the Reference Property consisting of such common equity. If, in
the case of any Share Exchange Event, the Reference Property includes shares
of stock, securities or other property or assets (other than cash and/or
cash equivalents) of a Person other than the successor or purchasing
corporation, as the case may be, in such Share Exchange Event, then such
supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other Person, if such
other Person is an affiliate of the Company or the successor or acquiring
company, and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests
of the Holders of the Notes as the Board of Directors shall reasonably
consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including the provisions
providing for the purchase rights set forth in Article 15\.

(b) When the Company executes a supplemental indenture pursuant to subsection
(a) of this Section 14.07, the Company shall promptly deliver to the Trustee
an Officers Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefor, the kind or
amount of cash, securities or property or asset that will comprise a unit of
Reference Property after any such Share Exchange Event, any adjustment to be
made with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied
with, and shall promptly deliver notice thereof to all Holders. The Company
shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be
delivered to each Holder within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to
deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such
supplemental indenture.

 

(c) The Company shall not become a party to any Share Exchange Event unless
its terms are consistent with this Section 14.07. None of the foregoing
provisions shall affect the right of a holder of Notes to convert its Notes
into shares of Common Stock, as set forth in Section 14.01 and Section 14.02
prior to the effective date of such Share Exchange Event.

 

(d) The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive
Share Exchange Events.

 

Section 14.08 _Certain Covenants_. (a) Subject to Sections 14.02(d) and
14.02(e), the Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock issued upon
conversion of Notes will be fully paid and non-assessable by the Company and
free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.

 

(b) The Company covenants that, if any shares of Common Stock to be provided
for the purpose of conversion of Notes hereunder require registration with or
approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before
such shares of Common Stock may be validly issued upon conversion, the Company
will, to the extent then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the
Commission, secure such registration or approval, as the case may be.

(c) The Company further covenants that if at any time the Common Stock shall
be listed on any national securities exchange or automated quotation system
the Company will list and use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep
listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or
automated quotation system, any Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Notes.

 



64

    

Section 14.09 _Responsibility of Trustee_. The Trustee and any other
Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to
any Holder to determine the Conversion Rate (or any adjustment thereto) or
whether any facts exist that may require any adjustment (including any
increase) of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or
calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method
employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed,
in making the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be
accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of
any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities, property or cash that may at
any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Note; and the
Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect
thereto.

Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any
failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common
Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the
surrender of any Note for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any
of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this
Article. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee
nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the
correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered
into pursuant to Section 14.07 relating either to the kind or amount of shares
of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Holders upon
the conversion of their Notes after any event referred to in such Section
14.07 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to
the provisions of Section 7.01, may accept (without any independent
investigation) as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such
provisions, and shall be protected in conclusively relying upon, the Officers
Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to deliver to the Trustee
prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect
thereto. The Trustee and the Conversion Agent may conclusively rely upon any
notice with respect to the commencement or termination of such conversion
rights.

 

Section 14.10 _Notice to Holders Prior to Certain Actions_. In case of any:

 

(a) action by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries that would require an
adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 14.04 or Section 14.11;

(b) Share Exchange Event; or

 

(c) voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the
Company;

 

then, in each case (unless notice of such event is otherwise required pursuant
to another provision of this Indenture) and to the extent applicable,
the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent
(if other than the Trustee) and to be delivered to each Holder, a notice
stating the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such
action by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or, if a record is not to be
taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record are to be
determined for the purposes of such action by the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries no later than the earlier of the date notice of such date is
required to be provided under Rule 10b-17 of the Exchange Act, other
applicable Commission rule or applicable rules of the principal U.S. national
or regional securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed or
admitted for trading and such date is publicly announced by the Company.
Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the
legality or validity of such action by the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries, Share Exchange Event, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.

 



65

    

Section 14.11 _Stockholder Rights Plans_. If the Company has a stockholder
rights plan in effect upon conversion of the Notes, each share of Common
Stock, if any, issued upon such conversion shall be entitled to receive the
appropriate number of rights, if any, under such stockholder rights plan and
the certificates representing the Common Stock issued upon such conversion
shall bear such legends, if any, in each case as may be provided by the terms
of any such stockholder rights plan, as the same may be amended from time to
time. However, if, prior to any conversion of Notes, the rights have
separated from the shares of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of
the applicable stockholder rights plan, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted
at the time of separation as if the Company distributed to all
or substantially all holders of the Common Stock Distributed Property as
provided in Section 14.04(c), subject to readjustment in the event of the
expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.

 

Section 14.12 _Exchange in Lieu of Conversion_. When a Holder surrenders its
Notes for conversion, the Company may, at its election (an "Exchange
Election"), direct the Conversion Agent to deliver, on or prior to the first
Trading Day following the Conversion Date, such Notes to a financial
institution designated by the Company for exchange in lieu of conversion. In
order to accept any Notes surrendered for conversion, the designated financial
institution must agree to timely deliver, in exchange for such Notes, the
shares of Common Stock due upon conversion as described in Section 14.02.
If the Company makes an Exchange Election, the Company shall, by the close of
business on the first Trading Day following the relevant Conversion Date,
notify in writing the Trustee, the Conversion Agent and the Holder
surrendering its Notes for conversion that it has made the Exchange Election,
and the Company shall notify the designated financial institution of the
Physical Settlement Method it with respect to such conversion and the relevant
deadline for payment and/or delivery of shares of Common Stock due upon
conversion.

Any Notes exchanged by the designated financial institution shall remain
outstanding. If the designated financial institution agrees to accept any
Notes for exchange but does not timely pay and/or deliver the required shares
of Common Stock due upon conversion, or if such designated financial
institution does not accept the Notes for exchange, the Company shall notify
in writing the Trustee, the Conversion Agent and the Holder surrendering its
Notes for conversion, and pay and/or deliver the required shares of Common
Stock due upon conversion to the converting Holder at the time and in the
manner required under this Indenture as if the Company had not made an
Exchange Election.

The Companys designation of a financial institution to which the Notes may
be submitted for exchange does not require that financial institution to
accept any Notes (unless the financial institution has separately made an
agreement with the Company). The Company may, but shall not be obligated to,
enter into a separate agreement with any designated financial institution that
would compensate it for any such transaction.

 

Section 14.13 _Limits Upon Issuance of Shares of Common Stock Upon
Conversion_. The Company shall not effect the conversion of any of the Notes
held by a Holder, and such Holder shall not have the right to convert any of
the Notes held by such Holder pursuant to the terms and conditions of this
Indenture and any such conversion shall be null and void and treated as if
never made, to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, such
Holder together with the other Attribution Parties collectively would
beneficially own in excess of 9.99% (the "Maximum Percentage") of the shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such
conversion. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder and the other
Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common Stock held
by such Holder and all other Attribution Parties plus the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes with respect to which the
determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude shares of
Common Stock which would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining,
nonconverted Notes beneficially owned by such Holder or any of the other
Attribution Parties and (B)

 



66

    

 exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any
other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any
convertible notes, convertible preferred stock or warrants, including the
Notes and the Initial Warrants) beneficially owned by such Holder or any other
Attribution Party subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous
to the limitation contained in this Section 14.13. For purposes of this
Section 14.13, beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with
Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act. For purposes of determining the number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock a Holder may acquire upon the conversion of
such Warrants without exceeding the Maximum Percentage, such Holder may rely
on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (x) the
Companys most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, Current Report on Form 8-K or other public filing with the Commission,
as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Company or
(z) any other written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent, if any,
setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (the "Reported
Outstanding Share Number"). If the Company receives a Conversion Notice from
a Holder at a time when the actual number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock is less than the Reported Outstanding Share Number, the Company shall
notify such Holder in writing of the number of shares of Common Stock
then outstanding and, to the extent that such Conversion Notice would
otherwise cause such Holders beneficial ownership, as determined pursuant to
this Section 14.13, to exceed the Maximum Percentage, such Holder must notify
the Company of a reduced number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased
pursuant to such Conversion Notice. For any reason at any time, upon the
written or oral request of any Holder, the Company shall within one (1)
Business Day confirm orally and in writing or by electronic mail to such
Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the
number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving
effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including
such Notes, by such Holder and any other Attribution Party since the date as
of which the Reported Outstanding Share Number was reported. In the event that
the issuance of shares of Common Stock to a Holder upon conversion of
such Notes results in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties being
deemed to beneficially own, in the aggregate, more than the Maximum Percentage
of the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock (as determined under
Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act), the number of shares so issued by which such
Holders and the other Attribution Parties aggregate beneficial ownership
exceeds the Maximum Percentage (the "Excess Shares") shall be deemed null and
void and shall be cancelled ab initio, and such Holder shall not have the
power to vote or to transfer the Excess Shares. Upon delivery of a written
notice to the Company, any Holder may from time to time increase (with such
increase not effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after delivery of
such notice) or decrease the Maximum Percentage of such Holder to any other
percentage not in excess of 9.99% as specified in such notice; provided that
(i) any such increase in the Maximum Percentage will not be effective until
the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to the Company and
(ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to such Holder and the
other Attribution Parties and not to any other Holder that is not an
Attribution Party of such Holder. For purposes of clarity, the shares of
Common Stock issuable to a Holder pursuant to the terms of this Indenture in
excess of the Maximum Percentage shall not be deemed to be beneficially owned
by such Holder for any purpose including for purposes of Section 13(d) or
Rule 16a-1(a)(1) of the 1934 Act. No prior inability to convert such Notes
pursuant to this paragraph shall have any effect on the applicability of the
provisions of this paragraph with respect to any subsequent determination of
convertibility. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and
implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of
this Section 14.13 to the extent necessary to correct this paragraph (or any
portion of this paragraph) which may be defective or inconsistent with the
intended beneficial ownership limitation contained in this Section 14.13 or to
make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to
such limitation. The limitation contained in this paragraph may not be waived
and shall apply to a successor holder of such Notes. Neither the Trustee nor
the Conversion Agent shall have any responsibility to determine the Maximum
Percentage or whether the issuance of any shares results in a Holder or
Attribution Party having Excess Shares or otherwise determine or monitor
compliance with the terms of this Section 14.13.

REPURCHASE OF NOTES AT OPTION OF HOLDERS

 

Section 15.01 _[Intentionally Omitted]_.

 

Section 15.02 _Repurchase at Option of Holders Upon a Fundamental Change_. (a)
If a Fundamental Change occurs at any time prior to the Maturity Date, each
Holder shall have the right, at such Holders option, to require the Company
to repurchase for cash all of such Holders Notes, or any portion of the
principal amount thereof that is equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of
$1,000, on the date (the "Fundamental Change Repurchase Date") specified by
the Company that is not less than 20 Business Days or more than 35 Business
Days following the date of the Fundamental Change Company Notice at a
repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, plus any remaining amounts that would be owed to,
but excluding, the Maturity Date, including all regularly scheduled
interest payments (the "Fundamental Change Repurchase Price"), unless the
Fundamental Change Repurchase Date falls after a Regular Record Date but on or
prior to the Interest Payment Date to which such Regular Record Date relates,
in which case the Company shall instead pay the full amount of accrued and
unpaid interest (to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date) to Holders of
record as of such Regular Record Date, and the Fundamental Change Repurchase
Price shall be equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes to be
repurchased pursuant to this Article 15, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, plus any remaining amounts that would be owed to, but excluding, the
Maturity Date, including all regularly scheduled interest payments. The
Fundamental Change Repurchase Date shall be subject to postponement in order
to allow the Company to comply with applicable law.

 

(b) Repurchases of Notes under this Section 15.02 shall be made, at the option
of the Holder thereof, upon:

 

(i) delivery to the paying agent by a Holder of a duly completed notice (the
"Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice") in the form set forth in Attachment 2
to the Form of Note attached hereto as Exhibit A, if the Notes are Physical
Notes, or in compliance with the Applicable Procedures for surrendering
interests in Global Notes, if the Notes are Global Notes, in each case on or
before the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the
Fundamental Change Repurchase Date; and

 

(ii) delivery of the Notes, if the Notes are Physical Notes, to the paying
agent at any time after delivery of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice
(together with all necessary endorsements for transfer) at the office of the
paying agent, or book- entry transfer of the Notes, if the Notes are Global
Notes, in compliance with the procedures of the Depositary, in each case such
delivery being a condition to receipt by the Holder of the Fundamental Change
Repurchase Price therefor.

The Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice in respect of any Notes to be
repurchased shall state:

(iii) in the case of Physical Notes, the certificate numbers of the Notes to
be delivered for repurchase;

(iv) the portion of the principal amount of Notes to be repurchased,
which must be in minimum denominations of $1,000 or an integral multiple
thereof; and

 



68

    

(v) that the Notes are to be repurchased by the Company pursuant to
the applicable provisions of the Notes and this Indenture;

_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Notes are Global Notes, the Fundamental
Change Repurchase Notice must comply with the Applicable Procedures.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Holder delivering to the
paying agent the Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice contemplated by this
Section 15.02 shall have the right to withdraw, in whole or in part, such
Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice at any time prior to the close of
business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change
Repurchase Date by delivery of a written notice of withdrawal to the paying
agent in accordance with Section 15.03.

 

The paying agent shall promptly notify the Company of the receipt by it of any
Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice or written notice of withdrawal thereof.

(c) On or before the 20th Business Day after the occurrence of the effective
date of a Fundamental Change, the Company shall provide to all Holders of
Notes, the Trustee, the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) and the
paying agent (in the case of a paying agent other than the Trustee) a written
notice (the "Fundamental Change Company Notice") of the occurrence of the
effective date of the Fundamental Change and of the repurchase right at the
option of the Holders arising as a result thereof. In the case of Physical
Notes, such notice shall be by first class mail or, in the case of Global
Notes, such notice shall be delivered in accordance with the Applicable
Procedures of the Depositary. Each Fundamental Change Company Notice shall
specify:

 

(i) the events causing the Fundamental Change;

 

(ii) the effective date of the Fundamental Change;

 

(iii) the last date on which a Holder may exercise the repurchase right
pursuant to this Article 15;

 

(iv) the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price;

 

(v) the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date;

 

(vi) the name and address of the paying agent and the Conversion Agent, if
applicable;

 

(vii) if applicable, the Conversion Rate and any adjustments to the Conversion
Rate;

 

(viii) that the Notes with respect to which a Fundamental Change Repurchase
Notice has been delivered by a Holder may be converted only if the Holder
withdraws the Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice in accordance with the
terms of this Indenture; and

 

(ix) the procedures that Holders must follow to require the Company to
repurchase their Notes.

 

No failure of the Company to give the foregoing notices and no defect therein
shall limit the Holders repurchase rights or affect the validity of the
proceedings for the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to this Section 15.02.
Simultaneously with providing such notice, the Company will publish such
information on its website or through such other public medium as the
Company may use at that time.

 



69

    

At the Companys written request, given at least five days prior to the date
the Fundamental Change Company Notice is to be sent, the Trustee shall give
such notice in the Companys name and at the Companys expense; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, in all cases, the text of such Fundamental Change Company
Notice shall be prepared by the Company.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Notes may be repurchased by the Company
on any date at the option of the Holders in connection with a Fundamental
Change if the principal amount of the Notes has been accelerated, and such
acceleration has not been rescinded, on or prior to such date (except in the
case of an acceleration resulting from a Default by the Company in the
payment of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price with respect to such
Notes). The paying agent will promptly return to the respective Holders
thereof any Physical Notes held by it during the acceleration of the Notes
(except in the case of an acceleration resulting from a Default by the
Company in the payment of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price with respect
to such Notes), or any instructions for book-entry transfer of the Notes in
compliance with the Applicable Procedures shall be deemed to have been
cancelled, and, upon such return or cancellation, as the case may be, the
Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice with respect thereto shall be deemed to
have been withdrawn.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture, the Company
shall not be required to repurchase, or to make an offer to repurchase, the
Notes upon a Fundamental Change if a third party makes such an offer in the
same manner, at the same time and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements for an offer made by the Company as set forth in this Article
15 (including, without limitation, the requirement to comply with applicable
securities laws), and such third party purchases all Notes properly
surrendered and not validly withdrawn under its offer in the same manner, at
the same time and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer
made by the Company as set forth in this Article 15 (including the requirement
to pay the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price on the later of the applicable
Fundamental Change Repurchase Date and the time of book-entry transfer or
delivery of the relevant Notes); _provided_ that the Company shall continue to
be obligated to (x) deliver the applicable Fundamental Change Repurchase
Notice to the Holders (which Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice shall state
that such third party shall make such an offer to purchase the Notes) and to
simultaneously with such Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice publish a notice
containing such information in a newspaper of general circulation in the City
of New York or publish the information on the Companys website or through
such other public medium as the Company may use at that time, (y) comply with
applicable securities laws as set forth in this Indenture in connection with
any such purchase and (z) pay the applicable Fundamental Change Repurchase
Price on the later of the applicable Fundamental Change Repurchase Date and
the time of book-entry transfer or delivery of the relevant Notes in
the event such third party fails to make such payment in such amount at such
time.

(f) For purposes of this Article 15, the paying agent may be any agent,
depositary, tender agent, paying agent or other agent appointed by the Company
to accomplish the purposes set forth herein.

 

Section 15.03 _Withdrawal of Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice_. (a) A
Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice may be withdrawn (in whole or in part)
by means of a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the office of the
paying agent in accordance with this Section 15.03 at any time prior to the
close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental
Change Repurchase Date, specifying:

(i) the principal amount of the Notes with respect to which such notice
of withdrawal is being submitted, which must be $1,000 or an integral
multiple thereof,

 



70

    

(ii) if Physical Notes have been issued, the certificate number of the
Note in respect of which such notice of withdrawal is being submitted, and

(iii) the principal amount, if any, of such Note that remains subject to the
original Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice, which portion must be in
principal amounts of $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000;

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Notes are Global Notes, the notice of
withdrawal must comply with appropriate procedures of the Depositary.

 

Section 15.04 _Deposit of Fundamental Change Repurchase Price_. (a) The
Company will deposit with the Trustee (or other paying agent appointed by the
Company), or if the Company is acting as its own paying agent, set aside,
segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 4.04 on or prior to 11:00
a.m., New York City time, on the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date (subject
to extension in order to allow the Company to comply with applicable law) an
amount of money sufficient to repurchase all of the Notes to be repurchased at
the appropriate Fundamental Change Repurchase Price. Subject to receipt of
funds and/or Notes by the Trustee (or other paying agent appointed by the
Company), payment for Notes surrendered for repurchase (and not withdrawn
prior to the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the
Fundamental Change Repurchase Date) will be made on the later of (i) the
Fundamental Change Repurchase Date (provided the Holder has satisfied the
conditions in Section 15.02) and (ii) the time of book-entry transfer or the
delivery of such Note to the Trustee (or other paying agent appointed by the
Company) by the Holder thereof in the manner required by Section 15.02 by
mailing checks for the amount payable to the Holders of such Notes entitled
thereto as they shall appear in the Note Register; provided, however, that
payments to the Depositary shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account of the Depositary or its nominee. The Trustee
shall, promptly after such payment and upon written demand by the
Company, return to the Company any funds in excess of the Fundamental Change
Repurchase Price.

(a) If by 11:00 a.m. New York City time, on the Fundamental Change Repurchase
Date, the Trustee (or other paying agent appointed by the Company) holds money
sufficient to make payment on all the Notes or portions thereof that are to be
repurchased on such Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, or, if extended in
order to allow the Company to comply with applicable law, such later date,
then, with respect to the Notes that have been properly surrendered for
repurchase and have not been validly withdrawn in accordance with the
provisions of this Indenture and the procedures of the Depositary, (i) such
Notes will cease to be outstanding, (ii) interest will cease to accrue on such
Notes on the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date or, if extended in order to
allow the Company to comply with applicable law, such later date (whether or
not book-entry transfer of the Notes has been made or the Notes have been
delivered to the Trustee or paying agent) and (iii) all other rights of the
Holders of such Notes with respect to the Notes will terminate on the
Fundamental Change Repurchase Date or, if extended in order to allow the
Company to comply with applicable law, such later date (other than (x) the
right to receive the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price and (y) if the
Fundamental Change Repurchase Date falls after a Regular Record Date but on or
prior to the related Interest Payment Date, the right of the Holder of record
on such Regular Record Date to receive the full amount of accrued and
unpaid interest to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date).

(b) Upon surrender of a Physical Note that is to be repurchased in part
pursuant to Section 15.02, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver to the Holder a new Physical Note in an authorized
denomination equal in principal amount to the unrepurchased portion of the
Physical Note surrendered.

Notes_. In connection with any repurchase offer, the Company will, if
required:

(a) comply with the provisions of any tender offer rules under the Exchange
Act that may then be applicable;

(b) file a Schedule TO or any other required schedule under the Exchange Act;
and

 

(c) otherwise comply in all material respects with all federal and state
securities laws in connection with any offer by the Company to repurchase the
Notes;

in each case, so as to permit the rights and obligations under this Article 15
to be exercised in the time and in the manner specified in this Article 15
subject to postponement in order to allow the Company to comply with
applicable law. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the provisions of this Indenture relating to the
Companys obligations to purchase the Notes upon a Fundamental Change, the
Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and
will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under such provisions of
this Indenture by virtue of such conflict.

Section 17.10 _Authenticating Agent_. The Trustee may appoint an
authenticating agent that shall be authorized to act on its behalf and
subject to its direction in the authentication and delivery of Notes in
connection with the original issuance thereof and transfers and exchanges of
Notes hereunder, including under Section 2.04, Section 2.05, Section
2.06, Section 2.07, Section 10.04 and Section 15.04 as fully to all intents
and purposes as though the authenticating agent had been expressly authorized
by this Indenture and those Sections to authenticate and deliver Notes. For
all purposes of this Indenture, the authentication and delivery of Notes by
the authenticating agent shall be deemed to be authentication and delivery of
such Notes "by the Trustee" and a certificate of authentication executed on
behalf of the Trustee by an authenticating agent shall be deemed to satisfy
any requirement hereunder or in the Notes for the Trustees certificate of
authentication. Such authenticating agent shall at all times be a Person
eligible to serve as trustee hereunder pursuant to Section 7.08.

Any corporation or other entity into which any authenticating agent may be
merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation
or other entity resulting from any merger, consolidation or conversion to

agent hereunder, if such successor corporation or other entity is otherwise
eligible under this Section 17.10, without the execution or filing of any
paper or any further act on the part of the parties hereto or the
authenticating agent or such successor corporation or other entity.

 



74

    

Any authenticating agent may at any time resign by giving written notice of
resignation to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time
terminate the agency of any authenticating agent by giving written notice of
termination to such authenticating agent and to the Company. Upon receiving
such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any
time any authenticating agent shall cease to be eligible under this Section,
the Trustee may appoint a successor authenticating agent (which may be the
Trustee), shall give written notice of such appointment to the Company and
shall deliver notice of such appointment to all Holders.

The Company agrees to pay to the authenticating agent from time to time
reasonable compensation for its services although the Company may terminate
the authenticating agent, if it determines such agents fees to be
unreasonable.

 

The provisions of Section 7.02, Section 7.03, Section 7.04, Section 8.03 and
this Section 17.10 shall be applicable to any authenticating agent.

If an authenticating agent is appointed pursuant to this Section 17.10, the

Section 17.14 _Force Majeure_. In no event shall the Trustee be responsible
or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations
hereunder arising out of or caused by, directly or indirectly, forces beyond
its control, including, without limitation, strikes, work stoppages,
accidents, acts of war or terrorism, pandemics, epidemics, civil or military
disturbances, nuclear or natural catastrophes or acts of God, and
interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, communications or computer
(software and hardware) services or the unavailability of the Federal Reserve
Bank wire or telex write or communication facility; it being understood that
the Trustee shall use reasonable efforts that are consistent with accepted
practices in the banking industry to resume performance as soon
as practicable under the circumstances.

Section 17.15 _Calculations_. The Company shall be responsible for making all
calculations called for under the Notes. These calculations include, but are
not limited to, determinations of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common
Stock, the Daily VWAPs, accrued interest payable on the Notes, any Additional
Interest on the Notes, the Conversion Rate of the Notes, Buy-In Price,
Maximum Percentage, Excess Shares, . The Company shall make all these
calculations in good faith and, absent manifest error, the Companys
calculations shall be final and binding on Holders of Notes. The Company
shall provide a schedule of its calculations to each of the Trustee and the
Conversion Agent, and each of the Trustee and Conversion Agent is entitled to
rely conclusively upon the accuracy of the Companys calculations without
independent verification. The Trustee will forward the Companys calculations
to any registered Holder of Notes upon the written request of that Holder at
the sole cost and expense of the Company. Neither the Trustee nor the
Conversion Agent will have any responsibility to make calculations under this
Indenture, nor will either of them have any responsibility to monitor the
Companys stock or trading price, determine whether the conditions
to convertibility of the Notes have been met or determine whether the
circumstances requiring changes to the Conversion Rate have occurred.

 

Section 17.16 _USA PATRIOT Act_. The parties hereto acknowledge that in
accordance with Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act, the Trustee, like all
financial institutions and in order to help fight the funding of terrorism and
money laundering, is required to obtain, verify, and record information that
identifies each person or legal entity that establishes a relationship
or opens an account with the Trustee. The parties to this Indenture agree
that they will provide the Trustee with such information as it may request in
order for the Trustee to satisfy the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act.

 

Section 17.17 _Tax Withholding_. The Company or the Trustee, as the case may
be, shall be entitled to make a deduction or withholding from any payment
which it makes under this Indenture for or on account of any present or future
taxes, duties or charges if and to the extent so required by any applicable
law and any current or future regulations or agreements thereunder or
official interpretations thereof or any law implementing an intergovernmental
approach thereto, in each case, that a Holder is subject to pursuant to the
Indenture ("Applicable Tax Law"), or by virtue of the relevant Holder failing
to satisfy any certification or other requirements under Applicable Tax Law in
respect of the Notes, in which event the Company or the Trustee, as the case
may be, shall make such payment after such withholding or deduction has
been made and shall account to the relevant authorities for the amount so

[FORM OF REVERSE OF NOTE]

 

[Lightning eMotors, Inc.]

7.50% Convertible Senior Note due 2024

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Notes of the Company,
designated as its 7.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the "Notes"),
limited to the aggregate principal amount of $100,000,000 all issued or to be
issued under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of [ ],
2021 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National
Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all
indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of
the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities
thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the
Notes. Additional Notes may be issued in an unlimited aggregate principal
amount, subject to certain conditions specified in the Indenture. Capitalized
terms used in this Note and not defined in this Note shall have the respective
meanings set forth in the Indenture.

In case certain Events of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
principal of, and interest on, all Notes may be declared, by either the
Trustee or Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of Notes then
outstanding, and upon said declaration shall become, due and payable, in the
manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions and certain exceptions
set forth in the Indenture.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company will make
all payments and deliveries in respect of the Fundamental Change Repurchase
Price on the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date and the principal amount on
the Maturity Date, as the case may be, to the Holder who surrenders a Note to
a Paying Agent to collect such payments in respect of the Note. The Company
will pay cash amounts in money of the United States that at the time of
payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.

 

The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee in
certain circumstances, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, and
in certain other circumstances, with the consent of the Holders of not less
than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time
outstanding, evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental
indentures modifying the terms of the Indenture and the Notes as described
therein. It is also provided in the Indenture that, subject to certain
exceptions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes at the time outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the
Notes waive any past Default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its
consequences.

 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture or any provision of this
Note, each Holder shall have the contractual right to receive payment or
delivery, as the case may be, of (x) the principal (including the Fundamental
Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) of, (y) accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, on, and (z) the consideration due upon conversion of, this Note, on
or after the respective due dates expressed or provided for in this Note or in
the Indenture, and the contractual right to institute suit for the enforcement
of any such payment or delivery, as the case may be, on or after such
respective dates, shall not be amended without the consent of each Holder.

The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in
minimum denominations of $1,000 principal amount and integral multiples in
excess thereof. At the office or agency of the Company referred to on the face
hereof, and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the
Indenture, Notes may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of
Notes of other authorized denominations, without payment of any service charge
but, if required by the Company or Trustee, with payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any transfer or similar tax that may be imposed in connection
therewith as a result of the name of the Holder of the new Notes issued upon
such exchange of Notes being different from the name of the Holder of the old
Notes surrendered for such exchange.

 



A-6

    

The Notes are not subject to redemption through the operation of any sinking
fund or otherwise.

Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, the Holder has the right, at such
Holders option, to require the Company to repurchase for cash all of such
Holders Notes or any portion thereof (in principal amounts of $1,000 or
integral multiples thereof) on the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date at a
price equal to the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price.

 

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder hereof has the right,
at its option, during certain periods and upon the occurrence of certain
conditions specified in the Indenture, prior to the close of business on the
second Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, to
convert any Notes or portion thereof that is $1,000 or an integral multiple
thereof, into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate specified in the
Indenture, as adjusted from time to time as provided in the Indenture.

Agent to act as agent for the Company for the Warrants, and the Warrant Agent
hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to perform the same in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

2\. _Warrants_.

2.1 _Form of Warrant_. Each Warrant shall initially be issued in registered
form only.

 



2

    

2.2 _Effect of Countersignature_. If a physical certificate is issued, unless
and until countersigned by the Warrant Agent pursuant to this Agreement, a
Warrant shall be invalid and of no effect and may not be exercised by the
holder thereof.

 

2.3 _Registration_.

2.3.1  _Warrant Register_. The Warrant Agent shall maintain books (the "
_Warrant Register_ "), for the registration of original issuance and the
registration of transfer of the Warrants. Upon the initial issuance of the
Warrants in book-entry form, the Warrant Agent shall issue and register the
Warrants in the names of the respective holders thereof in such denominations
and otherwise in accordance with instructions delivered to the Warrant Agent
by the Company. Ownership of beneficial interests in the Public Warrants
shall be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership shall be effected
through, records maintained by institutions that have accounts with the
Depositary (such institution, with respect to a Warrant in its account, a "
_Participant_ ").

If The Depository Trust Company (the " _Depositary_ ") subsequently ceases to
make its book-entry settlement system available for the Public Warrants, the
Company may instruct the Warrant Agent regarding making other arrangements for
book-entry settlement. In the event that the Public Warrants are not eligible
for, or it is no longer necessary to have the Public Warrants available in,
book-entry form, the Warrant Agent shall provide written instructions to the
Depositary to deliver to the Warrant Agent for cancellation each book-entry
Public Warrant, and the Company shall instruct the Warrant Agent to deliver
to the Depositary definitive certificates in physical form evidencing such
Warrants which shall be in the form annexed hereto as _Exhibit A_.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Initial Warrant, or
portion thereof, may be issued as part of, and be represented by, a Unit. Any
Initial Warrant so issued shall have the same terms, force and effect as a
certificated Initial Warrant that has been duly countersigned by the Warrant
Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Certificates representing the Warrants, if issued, shall be signed by, or
bear the facsimile signature of, the Chairman of the Board, President, Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary or other executive
officer of the Company. In the event the person whose facsimile signature has
been placed upon any Warrant shall have ceased to serve in the capacity in
which such person signed the Warrant before such Warrant is issued, it may be
issued with the same effect as if he or she had not ceased to be such at the
date of issuance. Each certificate representing a Founder Warrant or Working
Capital Warrant held by the Sponsor shall bear the legend set forth in
_Exhibit B_ hereto. Each certificate representing a Founder Warrant or Working
Capital Warrant held by a Founder (other than the Sponsor) shall bear the
legend set forth in _Exhibit C_ hereto. Each certificate representing a Note
Financing Warrant shall bear the legend set forth in _Exhibit D_ hereto.

 

2.3.2 _Registered Holder_. Prior to due presentment for registration of
transfer of any Warrant, the Company and the Warrant Agent may deem and treat
the person in whose name such Warrant is registered in the Warrant Register
(the " _Registered Holder_ ") as the absolute owner of such Warrant and of
each Warrant represented thereby, for the purpose of any exercise thereof,
and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent
shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

 

2.4 _Detachability of Warrants_. The Common Stock and Warrants comprising the
Public Units trade separately.

 

2.5 _No Fractional Warrants Other Than as Part of Units_. The Company shall
not issue fractional Warrants other than as part of the Units, each of which
is comprised of one share of Common Stock and three-fourths of one Initial
Warrant. If, upon the detachment of Initial Warrants from Units or otherwise,
a holder of Initial Warrants would be entitled to receive a
fractional Initial Warrant, the Company shall round down to the nearest whole
number the number of Initial Warrants to be issued to such holder.

 



3

    

2.6 _Founder Warrants and Working Capital Warrants_. The Founder Warrants and
the Working Capital Warrants shall be identical to the Public Warrants,
except that so long as they are held by a Founder or any of its Permitted
Transferees (as defined below) the Founder Warrants and the Working Capital
Warrants: (i) may be exercised for cash or, pursuant to subsection 3.3.1(c)
hereof, on a cashless basis, (ii) shall be subject to the Lock-up (as defined
below), and (iii) in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ hereof shall not
be redeemable by the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of
(ii), the Founder Warrants, the Working Capital Warrants and any shares of
Common Stock held by a Founder or its Permitted Transferees and issued upon
exercise of the Founder Warrants and the Working Capital Warrants may be
transferred by the holders thereof:

 

(a) amongst the Sponsor and its affiliates, to the Companys executive
officers or directors, or to any affiliate or family member of any of the
Companys executive officers or directors;

(b) in the case of an entity, as a distribution to its partners, stockholders
or members upon its liquidation;

(c) in the case of an individual, (i) by bona fide gift to such persons
immediate family or to a trust, the beneficiary of which is a member of such
persons immediate family, an affiliate of such person or to a charitable
organization, (ii) by virtue of the laws of descent and distribution upon
death of such person, or (iii) pursuant to a qualified domestic relations
order;

(d) by certain pledges to secure obligations incurred in connection
with purchases of the Companys securities;

(e) through private sales or transfers made in connection with the
consummation of the Companys initial Business Combination at prices no
greater than the price at which the Founder Warrants were originally
purchased;

 

(f) in the case of a Founder (other than the Sponsor), to such Founders
affiliates or any entity controlled by such Founder; or

 

(g) to the Company for no value for cancellation in connection with the
consummation of the Business Combination; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, in
each case (except clause (g)), these transferees (the " _Permitted
Transferees_ ") shall enter into a written agreement with the Company agreeing
to be bound by the transfer restrictions agreed to by the original holder in
connection with the purchase of the securities being transferred.

For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Lock-up_ " means the
restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 7 of the Unit Purchase
Agreements.

 

2.7 _Exercise Period for Certain Founders_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, any Founder Warrants and the Working Capital Warrants held by
the Founders (other than the Sponsor) or their respective designees or
affiliates shall not be exercisable on the date immediately following the
fifth anniversary of the effective date of the Registration Statement.

 

2.8 _Note Financing Warrants_. The Note Financing Warrants shall be identical
to the Public Warrants, except that the Note Financing Warrants in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ hereof shall not be redeemable by the Company.

3\. _Terms and Exercise of Warrants_. __

3.1 _Exercise Price_. Each whole Warrant shall, when countersigned by the
Warrant Agent, entitle the Registered Holder thereof, subject to the
provisions of such Warrant and of this Agreement, to purchase from the Company
the number of shares of Common Stock stated therein, at the price of $11.50
per share, subject to the adjustments provided in  _Section_ __ _ 4_ hereof
and in the

 



4

    

 last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 3.1_. The term " _Exercise Price_ " as
used in this Agreement shall mean the price per share at which shares of
Common Stock may be purchased at the time a Warrant is exercised. The Company
in its sole discretion may lower the Exercise Price at any time prior to the
Expiration Date (as defined below) for a period of not less than twenty (20)
Business Days, provided, that the Company shall provide at least twenty (20)
days prior written notice of such reduction to Registered Holders of the
Warrants and, provided further that any such reduction shall be identical
among all of the Warrants.

 

3.2 _Duration of Warrants_. A Warrant may be exercised only during the period
(the " _Exercise Period_ ") commencing on the later of: (i) the date that is
thirty (30) days after the first date on which the Company completes its
initial Business Combination, or (ii) the date that is twelve (12) months from
the date of the closing of the Offering, and terminating at 5:00 p.m., New
York City time on the earlier to occur of: (x) the date that is five (5) years
after the date on which the Company completes its initial Business
Combination, or (y) other than with respect to the Founder Warrants, the
Working Capital Warrants and the Note Financing Warrants to the extent then
held, directly or indirectly, by the original purchasers thereof or their
Permitted Transferees, the Redemption Date (as defined below) as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ hereof (the " _Expiration Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the exercise of any Warrant shall be subject to the
satisfaction of any applicable conditions, as set forth in _subsection 3.3.2_
below, with respect to an effective registration statement. Except with
respect to the right to receive the Redemption Price (as defined below) (other
than with respect to a Founder Warrant, a Working Capital Warrant or a Note
Financing Warrant to the extent then held, directly or indirectly, by the
original purchasers thereof or their Permitted Transferees) in the event of a
redemption (as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6_ hereof), each Warrant (other
than a Founder Warrant, Working Capital Warrant or Note Financing Warrant in
the event of a redemption to the extent then held, directly or indirectly, by
the original purchasers thereof or their Permitted Transferees) not exercised
on or before the Expiration Date shall become void, and all rights thereunder
and all rights in respect thereof under this Agreement shall cease at 5:00
p.m. New York City time on the Expiration Date. The Company in its sole
discretion may extend the duration of the Warrants by delaying the Expiration
Date; _provided_ , that the Company shall provide at least twenty (20) days
prior written notice of any such extension to Registered Holders of the
Warrants and, provided further that any such extension shall be identical in
duration among all the Warrants.

3.3 _Exercise of Warrants_. __

 

3.3.1 _Payment_. Subject to the provisions of the Warrant and this Agreement,
a Warrant, when countersigned by the Warrant Agent, may be exercised by the
Registered Holder thereof by surrendering it, at the office of the Warrant
Agent, or at the office of its successor as Warrant Agent, in the Borough of
Manhattan, City and State of New York, with the subscription form, as set
forth in the Warrant, duly executed, and by paying in full the Exercise Price
for each share of Common Stock as to which the Warrant is exercised and any
and all applicable taxes due in connection with the exercise of the Warrant,
the exchange of the Warrant for the shares of Common Stock and the issuance
of such Common Stock, as follows:

(a) in lawful money of the United States, in good certified check or good
bank draft payable to the order of the Warrant Agent;

(b) in the event of a redemption pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6_ hereof in
which the Companys board of directors (the " _Board_ ") has elected to
require all holders of the Warrants to exercise such Warrants on a "cashless
basis," by surrendering the Warrants for that number of shares of Common
Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number
of shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants, multiplied by the
difference between the Exercise Price and the Fair Market Value, as defined
in this _subsection 3.3.1(b)_ by (y) the Fair Market Value. Solely for
purposes of this _subsection 3.3.1(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the " _Fair
Market Value_ " shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Common
Stock for the five (5) trading days ending on the third trading day prior to
the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of the
Warrants, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6 _hereof;

 



5

    

(c) with respect to any Founder Warrant or Working Capital Warrant, so long as
such Founder Warrant or Working Capital Warrant is held by a Founder or a
Permitted Transferee of a Founder, by surrendering such Founder Warrants or
Working Capital Warrants for that number of shares of Common Stock equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of
Common Stock underlying the Warrants, multiplied by the difference between the
Exercise Price and the Fair Market Value, as defined in this _subsection
3.3.1(c)_ , by (y) the Fair Market Value. Solely for purposes of this
_subsection 3.3.1(c)_ , the " _Fair Market Value_ " shall mean the average
reported last sale price of the Common Stock for the five (5) trading days
ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which notice of exercise
of the Warrant is sent to the Warrant Agent; or

(d) as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ hereof.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the extent that
a holder that holds Warrants indirectly through a Participant submits
irrevocable instructions to exercise such Warrant, such holder shall be deemed
for purposes of Regulation SHO to have exercised such Warrant at the time of
delivery of such instructions, regardless of when shares of Common Stock are
delivered to such holder or its Participant.

3.3.2 _Issuance of Shares of Common Stock on Exercise_. As soon as
practicable after the exercise of any Warrant and the clearance of the funds
in payment of the Exercise Price (if payment is pursuant to _subsection
3.3.1(a))_ , the Company shall issue to the Registered Holder of such Warrant
a book-entry position or certificate, as applicable, for the number of full
shares of Common Stock to which he, she or it is entitled, registered in such
name or names as may be directed by him, her or it, and if such Warrant shall
not have been exercised in full, a new book-entry position or countersigned
Warrant, as applicable, for the number of shares of Common Stock as to which
such Warrant shall not have been exercised. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant
to the exercise of a Public Warrant or a Note Financing Warrant and shall have
no obligation to settle such Public Warrant or Note Financing Warrant exercise
unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the
shares of Common Stock underlying the Public Warrants or Note Financing
Warrant is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current,
subject to the Companys satisfying its obligations under _Section_ __ _
7.4_. No Public Warrant or Note Financing Warrant shall be exercisable and the
Company shall not be obligated to issue shares of Common Stock upon exercise
of a Public Warrant or a Note Financing Warrant unless the Common Stock
issuable upon such Public Warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or
deemed to be exempt from registration or qualification under the securities
laws of the state of residence of the Registered Holder of the Public
Warrants or Note Financing Warrants. In the event that the conditions in the
two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a Public
Warrant or a Note Financing Warrant, the holder of such Warrant shall not be
entitled to exercise such Public Warrant or Note Financing Warrant and such
Public Warrant or Note Financing Warrant may have no value and expire
worthless. In such case the purchaser of a Public Unit containing such Public
Warrant shall have paid the full purchase price for the Public Unit solely
for the share of Common Stock underlying such Public Unit. In no event will
the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrant or the Note
Financing Warrant exercise. The Company may require holders of
Public Warrants or Note Financing Warrants to settle the Public Warrant or
Note Financing Warrant on a "cashless basis" pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.4_.
If, by reason of any exercise of Warrants on a "cashless basis", the holder
of any Warrant would be entitled, upon the exercise of such Warrant, to
receive a fractional interest in a share of Common Stock, the Company shall
round down to the nearest whole number, the number of shares of Common Stock
to be issued to such holder. As used in this Agreement, "trading day" means
any day on which the Common Stock is traded on a national securities exchange
or quoted for trading on one or more OTC Markets.

 



6

    

3.3.3 _Valid Issuance_. All shares of Common Stock issued upon the proper
exercise of a Warrant in conformity with this Agreement shall be validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

 

3.3.4 _Date of Issuance_. Each person in whose name any book-entry position or
certificate, as applicable, for shares of Common Stock is issued shall for
all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of such shares of
Common Stock on the date on which the Warrant, or book-entry position
representing such Warrant, was surrendered and payment of the Exercise Price
was made, irrespective of the date of delivery of such certificate in the
case of a certificated Warrant, except that, if the date of such surrender and
payment is a date when the share transfer books of the Company or book-entry
system of the Warrant Agent are closed, such person shall be deemed to have
become the holder of such shares of Common Stock at the close of business on
the next succeeding date on which the share transfer books or book-entry
system are open.

 

3.3.5 _Maximum Percentage_. A holder of a Warrant may notify the Company in
writing in the event it elects to be subject to the provisions contained in
this _subsection 3.3.5_ ; _however_ , no holder of a Warrant shall be subject
to this _subsection 3.3.5_ unless he, she or it makes such election. If the
election is made by a holder, the Warrant Agent shall not effect the exercise
of the holders Warrant, and such holder shall not have the right to exercise
such Warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such
person (together with such persons affiliates), to the Warrant Agents
actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 9.8% (the " _Maximum
Percentage_ ") of the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after
giving effect to such exercise. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such person
and its affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of the Warrant with respect to which the determination of
such sentence is being made, but shall exclude shares of Common Stock that
would be issuable upon (x) exercise of the remaining, unexercised portion of
the Warrant beneficially owned by such person and its affiliates and (y)
exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other
securities of the Company beneficially owned by such person and its affiliates
(including, without limitation, any convertible notes or convertible preferred
stock or warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise
analogous to the limitation contained herein. Except as set forth in the
preceding sentence, for purposes of this paragraph, beneficial ownership shall
be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "). For purposes of the Warrant, in
determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the holder may
rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (1)
the Companys most recent annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly report on Form
10-Q, current report on Form 8-K or other public filing with the Commission
as the case may be, (2) a more recent public announcement by the Company or
(3) any other notice by the Company or Transfer Agent setting forth
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. For any reason at any time,
upon the written request of the holder of the Warrant, the Company shall,
within two (2) Business Days, confirm orally and in writing to such holder the
number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to
the conversion or exercise of equity securities of the Company by the holder
and its affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock was reported. By written notice to the Company, the
holder of a Warrant may from time to time increase or decrease the Maximum
Percentage applicable to such holder to any other percentage specified in
such notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such increase shall not be
effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to
the Company.

 



7

    

4\. _Adjustments_.

 

4.1 _Stock Dividends_. __

 

4.1.1 _Split-Ups_. If after the date hereof, and subject to the provisions
of  _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ below, the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock is increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of Common Stock, or
by a split-up of shares of Common Stock or other similar event, then, on the
effective date of such stock dividend, split-up or similar event, the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable on exercise of each Warrant shall be
increased in proportion to such increase in the outstanding shares of Common
Stock.

4.1.2 _Extraordinary Dividends_. If the Company, at any time while
the Warrants are outstanding and unexpired, shall pay a dividend or make a
distribution in cash, securities or other assets to the holders of the Common
Stock on account of such shares of Common Stock (or other shares of the
Companys capital stock into which the Warrants are convertible) (an "
_Extraordinary Dividend_ "), then the Exercise Price shall be decreased,
effective immediately after the effective date of such Extraordinary Dividend,
by the amount of cash and/or the fair market value (as determined by the
Board, in good faith) of any securities or other assets paid on each share of
Common Stock in respect of such Extraordinary Dividend; provided, however,
that none of the following shall be deemed an Extraordinary Dividend for
purposes of this provision: (a) any adjustment described in subsection 4.1.1
above, (b) any cash dividend or cash distribution which, when combined on a
per share basis with the per share amounts of all other cash dividends and
cash distributions paid on the Common Stock during the 365-day period ending
on the date of declaration of such dividend or distribution does not exceed
$0.50 (as adjusted to appropriately reflect any of the events referred to in
other subsections of this _Section_ __ _ 4_ and excluding cash dividends or
cash distributions that resulted in an adjustment to the Exercise Price or to
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on exercise of each Warrant)
but only with respect to the amount of the aggregate cash dividend or cash
distribution equal to or less than $0.50, (c) any payment to satisfy the
redemption rights of the holders of the shares of Common Stock in connection
with a proposed initial Business Combination or (d) any payment in connection
with the Companys liquidation and the distribution of its assets upon its
failure to consummate a Business Combination. Solely for purposes
of illustration, if the Company, at a time while the Warrants are outstanding
and unexpired, pays a cash dividend of $0.35 and previously paid an aggregate
of $0.40 of cash dividends and cash distributions on the Common Stock during
the 365-day period ending on the date of declaration of such $0.35 dividend,
then the Warrant Price will be decreased, effectively immediately after the
effective date of such $0.35 dividend, by $0.25 (the absolute value of the
difference between $0.75 (the aggregate amount of all cash dividends and cash
distributions paid or made in such 365-day period, including such $0.35
dividend) and $0.50 (the greater of (x) $0.50 and (y) the aggregate amount of
all cash dividends and cash distributions paid or made in such 365-day period
prior to such $0.35 dividend)).

 

4.2 _Aggregation of Shares_. If after the date hereof, and subject to the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ hereof, the number of outstanding shares
of Common Stock is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse stock
split or reclassification of shares of Common Stock or other similar event,
then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse stock
split, reclassification or similar event, the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable on exercise of each Warrant shall be decreased in proportion to such
decrease in outstanding shares of Common Stock.

 

4.3 _Adjustments in Exercise Price_. __

 

4.3.1 Whenever the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the
exercise of the Warrants is adjusted, as provided in _subsection 4.1.1_ or
_Section_ __ _ 4.2_ above, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted (to the
nearest cent) by multiplying such Exercise Price immediately prior to such
adjustment by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants
immediately prior to such adjustment, and (y) the denominator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock so purchasable immediately thereafter.

 



8

    

4.3.2 If (a) the Company issues additional shares of Common Stock or equity-
linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing
of the initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price
of less than $9.20 per share of Common Stock (with such issue price or
effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Board, and in the
case of any such issuance to Founders or their affiliates, without taking into
account any founder shares held by them prior to such issuance), (b) the
aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 65% of the
total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the
initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of the initial
Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (c) the volume weighted
average trading price of Common Stock during the 20 trading-day period
starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates
the initial Business Combination (such price, the " _Market Value_ ") is
below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the Warrants will be adjusted (to
the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the greater of (i) the Market Value
or (ii) the price at which the Company issues the additional shares of Common
Stock or equity-linked securities.

4.4 _Replacement of Securities upon Reorganization, etc_. In case of any
reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
(other than a change under _subsections 4.1.1_ or _4.1.2_ or _Section_ __ _
4.2_ hereof or that solely affects the par value of such shares of Common
Stock), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of the Company with or
into another entity or conversion of the Company into another entity (other
than a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing
corporation and that does not result in any reclassification or reorganization
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock), or in the case of any sale or
conveyance to another entity of the assets or other property of the Company
as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which the
Company is dissolved, the holders of the Warrants shall thereafter have the
right to purchase and receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and
conditions specified in the Warrants and in lieu of the shares of Common
Stock of the Company immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon
the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of shares
of stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon
such reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a
dissolution following any such sale or transfer, that the holder of the
Warrants would have received if such holder had exercised his, her or its
Warrant(s) immediately prior to such event; and if any reclassification also
results in a change in shares of Common Stock covered by _Sections 4.1 or 4.2_
, then such adjustment shall be made pursuant to _Sections 4.1, 4.2_ and
this  _Section_ __ _ 4.4_. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ shall
similarly apply to successive reclassifications, reorganizations, mergers or
consolidations, sales or other transfers. In no event will the Exercise Price
be reduced to less than the par value per share issuable upon exercise of the
Warrant.

4.5 _Notices of Changes in Warrant_. Upon every adjustment of the Exercise
Price or the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of a
Warrant, the Company shall give written notice thereof to the Warrant Agent,
which notice shall state the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment
and the increase or decrease, if any, in the number of shares of Common Stock
purchasable at such price upon the exercise of a Warrant, setting forth in
reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such
calculation is based. Upon the occurrence of any event specified in _Sections
4.1_ , _4.2_ , _4.3_ or _4.4_ , the Company shall give written notice of the
occurrence of such event to each holder of a Warrant, at the last address set
forth for such holder in the Warrant Register, of the record date or the
effective date of the event. Failure to give such notice, or any defect
therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such event.

 

4.6 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not issue fractional shares of
Common Stock upon the exercise of Warrants. If, by reason of any adjustment
made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4_, the holder of any Warrant would be
entitled, upon the exercise of such Warrant, to receive a fractional interest
in a share, the Company shall, upon such exercise, round down to the nearest
whole number the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to such holder.

 



9

    

4.7 _Form of Warrant_. The form of Warrant need not be changed because of
any adjustment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4_, and Warrants issued after
such adjustment may state the same Exercise Price and the same number of
shares of Common Stock as is stated in the Warrants initially issued pursuant
to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may at any time
in its sole discretion make any change in the form of Warrant that the Company
may deem appropriate and that does not affect the substance thereof, and any
Warrant thereafter issued or countersigned, whether in exchange or
substitution for an outstanding Warrant or otherwise, may be in the form as so
changed.

 

4.8 _Other Events_. In case any event shall occur affecting the Company as to
which none of the provisions of preceding subsections of this _Section_ __ _
4_ are strictly applicable, but which would require an adjustment to the terms
of the Warrants in order to (i) avoid an adverse impact on the Warrants and
(ii) effectuate the intent and purpose of this  _Section_ __ _ 4_, then, in
each such case, the Company shall appoint a firm of independent public
accountants, investment banking or other appraisal firm of recognized national
standing, which shall give its opinion as to whether or not any adjustment to
the rights represented by the Warrants is necessary to effectuate the intent
and purpose of this _Section_ __ _ 4_ and, if they determine that an
adjustment is necessary, the terms of such adjustment,  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that under no circumstances shall the Warrants be adjusted
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ as a result of any issuance of
securities in connection with the initial Business Combination. The Company
shall adjust the terms of the Warrants in a manner that is consistent with any
adjustment recommended in such opinion.

5.  _Transfer and Exchange of Warrants_. __

5.1 _Registration of Transfer_. The Warrant Agent shall register the transfer,
from time to time, of any outstanding Warrant upon the Warrant Register, upon
surrender of such Warrant for transfer, in the case of certificated Warrants,
properly endorsed with signatures properly guaranteed and accompanied by
appropriate instructions for transfer. Upon any such transfer, a new Warrant
representing an equal aggregate number of Warrants shall be issued and the old
Warrant shall be cancelled by the Warrant Agent. In the case of certificated
Warrants, the Warrants so cancelled shall be delivered by the Warrant Agent
to the Company from time to time upon request.

5.2 _Procedure for Surrender of Warrants_. Warrants may be surrendered to the
Warrant Agent, together with a written request for exchange or transfer, and
thereupon the Warrant Agent shall issue in exchange therefor one or more new
Warrants as requested by the Registered Holder of the Warrants
so surrendered, representing an equal aggregate number of Warrants;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that a Warrant surrendered for
transfer bears a restrictive legend (as in the case of the Founder Warrants,
the Working Capital Warrants or the Note Financing Warrants), the Warrant
Agent shall not cancel such Warrant and issue new Warrants in exchange thereof
until the Warrant Agent has received an opinion of counsel for the Company
stating that such transfer may be made and indicating whether the new
Warrants must also bear a restrictive legend.

5.3 _Fractional Warrants_. The Warrant Agent shall not be required to effect
any registration of transfer or exchange which shall result in the issuance of
a warrant certificate or book-entry position for a fraction of a warrant,
except as part of the Units.

 

5.4 _Service Charges_. No service charge shall be made for any exchange or
registration of transfer of Warrants.

 

5.5 _Warrant Execution and Countersignature_. The Warrant Agent is hereby
authorized to countersign and to deliver, in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the Warrants required to be issued pursuant to the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 5_, and the Company, whenever required by the Warrant
Agent, shall supply the Warrant Agent with Warrants duly executed on behalf
of the Company for such purpose.

 



10

    

5.6 _Transfer of Warrants_. Each transfer of a Unit on the register relating
to such Units shall operate also to transfer the Warrants included in such
Unit. This _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall not apply to the Note Financing Warrants
as they are not issued in conjunction with Units.

 

5.7 _Transfer of Note Financing Warrants to Affiliates_. The Subscribers shall
be permitted to transfer the Note Financing Warrants to their respective
affiliates so long as such affiliates have entered into a written agreement
with the Company agreeing to comply with any applicable transfer restrictions
under federal and state securities laws in accordance with the provisions
of the Subscription Agreements and this Agreement.

6\. _Redemption_.

 

6.1 _Redemption_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.5_
hereof, not less than all of the outstanding Warrants may be redeemed, at the
option of the Company, at any time while they are exercisable and prior to
their expiration, at the office of the Warrant Agent, upon notice to the
Registered Holders of the Warrants, as described in  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_
below, at the price of $0.01 per Warrant (the " _Redemption Price_ "),
provided that the last sales price of the Common Stock reported has been at
least $18.00 per share (subject to adjustment in compliance with _Section_ 4
hereof), on each of twenty (20) trading days within the thirty (30) trading-
day period ending on the third Business Day prior to the date on which notice
of the redemption is given and provided that there is an effective
registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Warrants, and a current prospectus relating thereto, available
throughout the 30-day Redemption Period (as defined in _Section_ __ _ 6.2_
below) or the Company has elected to require the exercise of the Warrants on a
"cashless basis" pursuant to _subsection 3.3.1_ ; provided, however, that if
and when the Public Warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may
not exercise such redemption right if the issuance of shares of Common Stock
upon exercise of the Public Warrants is not exempt from registration or
qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or the Company is unable to
effect such registration or qualification.

 

6.2 _Date Fixed for, and Notice of, Redemption_. In the event that the Company
elects to redeem all of the Warrants, the Company shall fix a date for the
redemption (the " _Redemption Date_ "). Notice of redemption shall be mailed
by first class mail, postage prepaid, by the Company not less than thirty (30)
days prior to the Redemption Date (such 30-day period, the " _Redemption
Period_ ") to the Registered Holders of the Warrants to be redeemed at their
last addresses as they shall appear on the registration books. Any notice
mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have
been duly given whether or not the Registered Holder received such notice.

 

6.3 _Exercise After Notice of Redemption_. The Warrants may be exercised, for
cash (or on a "cashless basis" in accordance with  _subsection 3.3.1(b)_ of
this Agreement) at any time after notice of redemption shall have been given
by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ hereof and prior to the
Redemption Date. In the event that the Company determines to require all
holders of Warrants to exercise their Warrants on a "cashless basis" pursuant
to _subsection 3.3.1_ , the notice of redemption shall contain the information
necessary to calculate the number of shares of Common Stock to be received
upon exercise of the Warrants, including the Fair Market Value (as such term
is defined in _subsection 3.3.1(b)_ hereof) in such case. On and after the
Redemption Date, the record holder of the Warrants shall have no further
rights except to receive, upon surrender of the Warrants, the Redemption
Price.

 



11

    

6.4 _Exclusion of Founder Warrants and Working Capital Warrants_. The Company
agrees that the redemption rights provided in this _Section_ __ _ 6_ shall
not apply to the Founder Warrants or the Working Capital Warrants if at the
time of the redemption such Founder Warrants or Working Capital Warrants
continue to be held by the Founders and/or their Permitted Transferees.
However, once such Founder Warrants or Working Capital Warrants are
transferred (other than to Permitted Transferees under _Section_ __ _ 2.7_),
the Company may redeem the Founder Warrants and the Working Capital Warrants,
provided that the criteria for redemption are met, including the opportunity
of the holder of such Founder Warrants or Working Capital Warrants to exercise
the Founder Warrants and the Working Capital Warrants prior to redemption
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.3_. Founder Warrants and Working Capital
Warrants that are transferred to persons other than Permitted Transferees
shall upon such transfer cease to be Founder Warrants or Working Capital
Warrants, as applicable, and shall become Public Warrants under this
Agreement.

6.5 _Exclusion of Note Financing Warrants_. The Company agrees that the
redemption rights provided in this _Section_ __ _ 6_ shall not apply to the
Note Financing Warrants if at the time of the redemption such Note Financing
Warrants continue to be held, either directly or indirectly through one or
more Participants, by the Subscribers and/or their Permitted Transferees.
However, once such Note Financing Warrants are transferred, the Company may
redeem the Note Financing Warrants, provided that the criteria for redemption
are met, including the opportunity of the holder of such Note Financing
Warrants to exercise the Note Financing Warrants prior to redemption pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 6.3_. Note Financing Warrants that are transferred shall
upon such transfer cease to be Note Financing Warrants and shall become Public
Warrants under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Note Financing Warrants that were originally
purchased by a Subscriber shall not be deemed to have been transferred so long
as such Note Financing Warrants continue to be held by such Subscriber and/or
its Permitted Transferees, in each case directly or indirectly through one
or more Participants.

7\. _Other Provisions Relating to Rights of Holders of Warrants_. __

 

7.1 _No Rights as Stockholder_. A Warrant does not entitle the Registered
Holder thereof to any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company,
including, without limitation, the right to receive dividends, or other
distributions, exercise any preemptive rights to vote or to consent or to
receive notice as stockholders in respect of the meetings of stockholders or
the election of directors of the Company or any other matter.

7.2 _Lost, Stolen, Mutilated, or Destroyed Warrants_. If any Warrant is lost,
stolen, mutilated, or destroyed, the Company and the Warrant Agent may on
such terms as to indemnity or otherwise as they may in their discretion impose
(which shall, in the case of a mutilated Warrant, include the surrender
thereof), issue a new Warrant of like denomination, tenor, and date as the
Warrant so lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed. Any such new Warrant shall
constitute a substitute contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not
the allegedly lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed Warrant shall be at any
time enforceable by anyone.

7.3 _Reservation of Common Stock_. The Company shall at all times reserve
and keep available a number of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock that shall be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all
outstanding Warrants issued pursuant to this Agreement.

 

7.4 _Registration of Common Stock; Cashless Exercise at Company s Option_. __

 

7.4.1 _Registration of the Common Stock_. The Company agrees that as soon as
practicable, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the
closing of its initial Business Combination, it shall use its best efforts to
file with the Commission a registration statement for the registration, under
the Securities Act, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
the Warrants. The Company shall use its best efforts to cause the same to
become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of
the Warrants in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If any such
registration statement has not been declared effective by the 90th day
following the closing of the Business Combination, holders of the Warrants
shall have the right, 

 



12

    

 during the period beginning on the 91st day after the closing of the
Business Combination and ending upon such registration statement being
declared effective by the Commission, and during any other period when the
Company shall fail to have maintained an effective registration statement
covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, to
exercise such Warrants on a "cashless basis," by exchanging the Warrants (in
accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act (or any successor rule)
or another exemption) for that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of
Common Stock underlying the Warrants, multiplied by the difference between the
Exercise Price and the Fair Market Value (as defined below) by (y) the Fair
Market Value. Solely for purposes of this _subsection 7.4.1_ , " _Fair Market
Value_ " shall mean the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock as
reported during the five (5) trading day period ending on the trading day
prior to the date that notice of exercise is received by the Warrant
Agent from the holder of such Warrants or its securities broker or
intermediary. The date that notice of cashless exercise is received by the
Warrant Agent shall be conclusively determined by the Warrant Agent. In
connection with the "cashless exercise" of a Public Warrant or a Note
Financing Warrant, the Company shall, upon request, provide the Warrant Agent
with an opinion of counsel for the Company (which shall be an outside law firm
with securities law experience) stating that (i) the exercise of the Warrants
on a cashless basis in accordance with this _subsection 7.4.1_ is not required
to be registered under the Securities Act and (ii) the shares of Common Stock
issued upon such exercise shall be freely tradable under United States
federal securities laws by anyone who is not an affiliate (as such term is
defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or any successor rule)) of the
Company and, accordingly, shall not be required to bear a restrictive legend.
Except as provided in _subsection_ __ _ 7.4.2_, for the avoidance of any
doubt, unless and until all of the Warrants have been exercised, the Company
shall continue to be obligated to comply with its registration obligations
under the first three sentences of this _subsection 7.4.1_. __

7.4.2 _Cashless Exercise at Company s Option_. If the Common Stock is at the
time of any exercise of a Warrant not listed on a national securities exchange
such that it satisfies the definition of a "covered security" under Section
18(b)(1) of the Securities Act (or any successor rule), the Company may, at
its option, (i) require holders of Public Warrants or Note Financing Warrants
who exercise Public Warrants or Note Financing Warrants to exercise such
Public Warrants or Note Financing Warrants on a "cashless basis" in
accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act (or any successor rule)
as described in _subsection 7.4.1_ and (ii) in the event the Company so
elects, the Company shall not be required to file or maintain in effect a
registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary. If the Company does not elect at the time
of exercise to require a holder of Public Warrants or Note Financing Warrants
who exercises Public Warrants or Note Financing Warrants to exercise such
Public Warrants or Note Financing Warrants on a "cashless basis," it agrees
to use its best efforts to register or qualify for sale the Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrant or Note Financing Warrant under
the blue sky laws of the state of residence in those states in which
the Public Warrants or Note Financing Warrants were initially offered by the
Company of the exercising Public Warrant or Note Financing Warrant holder to
the extent an exemption is not available.

 

8\. _Concerning the Warrant Agent and Other Matters_. __

 

8.1 _Payment of Taxes_. The Company shall from time to time promptly pay all
taxes and charges that may be imposed upon the Company or the Warrant Agent
in respect of the issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon the
exercise of the Warrants, but the Company shall not be obligated to pay any
transfer taxes in respect of the Warrants or such shares of Common Stock.

 



13

    

8.2 _Resignation, Consolidation, or Merger of Warrant Agent_. __

 

8.2.1 _Appointment of Successor Warrant Agent_. The Warrant Agent, or any
successor to it hereafter appointed, may resign its duties and be discharged
from all further duties and liabilities hereunder after giving sixty (60)
days notice in writing to the Company. If the office of the Warrant Agent
becomes vacant by resignation or incapacity to act or otherwise, the
Company shall appoint in writing a successor Warrant Agent in place of the
Warrant Agent. If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a
period of thirty (30) days after it has been notified in writing of such
resignation or incapacity by the Warrant Agent or by the holder of a Warrant
(who shall, with such notice, submit his Warrant for inspection by the
Company), then the holder of any Warrant may apply to the Supreme Court of the
State of New York for the County of New York for the appointment of a
successor Warrant Agent at the Companys cost. Any successor Warrant Agent,
whether appointed by the Company or by such court, shall be a corporation
organized and existing under the laws of the State of New York, in
good standing and having its principal office in the Borough of Manhattan,
City and State of New York, and authorized under such laws to exercise
corporate trust powers and subject to supervision or examination by federal or
state authority. After appointment, any successor Warrant Agent shall be
vested with all the authority, powers, rights, immunities, duties, and
obligations of its predecessor Warrant Agent with like effect as if originally
named as Warrant Agent hereunder, without any further act or deed; but if for
any reason it becomes necessary or appropriate, the predecessor Warrant Agent
shall execute and deliver, at the expense of the Company, an instrument
transferring to such successor Warrant Agent all the authority, powers, and
rights of such predecessor Warrant Agent hereunder; and upon request of any
successor Warrant Agent the Company shall make, execute, acknowledge, and
deliver any and all instruments in writing for more fully and effectually
vesting in and confirming to such successor Warrant Agent all such authority,
powers, rights, immunities, duties, and obligations.

8.2.2 _Notice of Successor Warrant Agent_. In the event a successor Warrant
Agent shall be appointed, the Company shall give notice thereof to the
predecessor Warrant Agent and the Transfer Agent for the Common Stock not
later than the effective date of any such appointment.

8.2.3 _Merger or Consolidation of Warrant Agent_. Any corporation into which
the Warrant Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated or any
corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Warrant
Agent shall be a party shall be the successor Warrant Agent under this
Agreement without any further act.

 

8.3 _Fees and Expenses of Warrant Agent_. __

 

8.3.1 _Remuneration_. The Company agrees to pay the Warrant Agent reasonable
remuneration for its services as such Warrant Agent hereunder and shall,
pursuant to its obligations under this Agreement, reimburse the Warrant Agent
upon demand for all expenditures that the Warrant Agent may reasonably incur
in the execution of its duties hereunder.

 

8.3.2 _Further Assurances_. The Company agrees to perform, execute,
acknowledge, and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged,
and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments, and assurances as
may reasonably be required by the Warrant Agent for the carrying out or
performing of the provisions of this Agreement.

 

8.4 _Liability of Warrant Agent_. __

 

8.4.1 _Reliance on Company Statement_. Whenever in the performance of its
duties under this Agreement, the Warrant Agent shall deem it necessary or
desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company
prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless
other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be
deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a statement signed by the
President, Chief Executive Officer or Chairman of the Board of the Company and
delivered to the Warrant Agent. The Warrant Agent may rely upon such statement
for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement.

 



14

    

8.4.2 _Indemnity_. The Warrant Agent shall be liable hereunder only for its
own gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. The Company agrees to
indemnify the Warrant Agent and save it harmless against any and all
liabilities, including judgments, costs and reasonable counsel fees, for
anything done or omitted by the Warrant Agent in the execution of this
Agreement, except as a result of the Warrant Agents gross negligence, willful
misconduct or bad faith.

 

8.4.3 _Exclusions_. The Warrant Agent shall have no responsibility with
respect to the validity of this Agreement or with respect to the validity or
execution of any Warrant (except its countersignature thereof). The Warrant
Agent shall not be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant
or condition contained in this Agreement or in any Warrant. The Warrant Agent
shall not be responsible to make any adjustments required under the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 4_ hereof or responsible for the manner, method,
or amount of any such adjustment or the ascertaining of the existence of facts
that would require any such adjustment; nor shall it by any act hereunder be
deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or
reservation of any shares of Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this
Agreement or any Warrant or as to whether any shares of Common Stock shall,
when issued, be valid and fully paid and non-assessable.

 

8.5 _Acceptance of Agency_. The Warrant Agent hereby accepts the agency
established by this Agreement and agrees to perform the same upon the terms
and conditions herein set forth and among other things, shall account promptly
to the Company with respect to Warrants exercised and concurrently account
for, and pay to the Company, all monies received by the Warrant Agent for
the purchase of shares of Common Stock through the exercise of the Warrants.

8.6 _Waiver_. The Warrant Agent has no right of set-off or any other right,
title, interest or claim of any kind (" _Claim_ ") in, or to any distribution
of, the Trust Account (as defined in that certain Investment Management Trust
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and between the Company and the
Warrant Agent as trustee thereunder) and hereby agrees not to seek recourse,
reimbursement, payment or satisfaction for any Claim against the Trust Account
for any reason whatsoever. The Warrant Agent hereby waives any and all Claims
against the Trust Account and any and all rights to seek access to the Trust
Account.

 

9\. _Miscellaneous Provisions_. __

 

9.1 _Successors_. All the covenants and provisions of this Agreement by or for
the benefit of the Company or the Warrant Agent shall bind and inure to the
benefit of their respective successors and assigns.

jurisdiction. The Company hereby agrees that any action, proceeding or claim
against it arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement shall be
brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and
irrevocably submits to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be
exclusive. The Company hereby waives any objection to such exclusive
jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.

 

9.4 _Persons Having Rights under this Agreement_. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be construed to confer upon, or give to, any person or corporation
other than the parties hereto and the Registered Holders of the Warrants any
right, remedy, or claim under or by reason of this Agreement or of any

Warrant Certificate

This Warrant Certificate certifies that , or its registered assigns, is the
registered holder of ____

 

warrant(s) evidenced hereby (the " _Warrants_ " and each, a " _Warrant_ ") to
purchase shares of Common Stock, $0.0001 par value (" _Common Stock_ "), of
GigCapital3, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Each whole
Warrant entitles the holder, upon exercise during the period set forth in the
Warrant Agreement referred to below, to receive from the Company that number
of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock as set forth below, at
the exercise price (the " _Exercise Price_ ") as determined pursuant to the
Warrant Agreement, payable in lawful money (or through " _cashless exercise_ "
as provided for in the Warrant Agreement) of the United States of America
upon surrender of this Warrant Certificate and payment of the Exercise Price
at the office or agency of the Warrant Agent referred to below, subject to the
conditions set forth herein and in the Warrant Agreement. Defined terms used
in this Warrant Certificate but not defined herein shall have the meanings
given to them in the Warrant Agreement.

Each whole Warrant is initially exercisable for one fully paid and non-
assessable share of Common Stock. No fractional shares will be issued upon
exercise of any Warrant. If, upon the exercise of Warrants, a holder would
be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share of Common Stock, the
Company will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number
of shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Warrant holder. The number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants is subject to
adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events set forth in the Warrant
Agreement.

 

The initial Exercise Price per share of Common Stock for any Warrant is equal
to $11.50 per share. The Exercise Price is subject to adjustment upon the
occurrence of certain events set forth in the Warrant Agreement.

Subject to the conditions set forth in the Warrant Agreement, the Warrants
may be exercised only during the Exercise Period and to the extent not
exercised by the end of such Exercise Period, such Warrants shall become void.

 

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Warrant Certificate
set forth on the reverse hereof and such further provisions shall for all
purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.

   

This Warrant Certificate shall not be valid unless countersigned by the
Warrant Agent, as such term is used in the Warrant Agreement.

This Warrant Certificate shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of
laws principles thereof.

The Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate are part of a duly
authorized issue of Warrants entitling the holder on exercise to
receive shares of Common Stock and are issued or to be issued pursuant to an
Amended and Restated Warrant Agreement dated as of ___, 2020 (the " _Warrant
Agreement_ "), duly executed and delivered by the Company to Continental
Stock Transfer and Trust Company, a New York corporation, as warrant agent (the
" _Warrant Agent_ "), which Warrant Agreement is hereby incorporated by
reference in and made a part of this instrument and is hereby referred to for
a description of the rights, limitation of rights, obligations, duties and
immunities thereunder of the Warrant Agent, the Company and the holders (the
words " _holders_ " or " _holder_ " meaning the Registered Holders or
Registered Holder) of the Warrants. A copy of the Warrant Agreement may be
obtained by the holder hereof upon written request to the Company. Defined
terms used in this Warrant Certificate but not defined herein shall have the
meanings given to them in the Warrant Agreement.

Warrants may be exercised at any time during the Exercise Period set forth in
the Warrant Agreement. The holder of Warrants evidenced by this Warrant
Certificate may exercise them by surrendering this Warrant Certificate, with
the form of election to purchase set forth hereon properly completed and
executed, together with payment of the Exercise Price as specified in the
Warrant Agreement (or through "cashless exercise" as provided for in the
Warrant Agreement) at the principal corporate trust office of the Warrant
Agent. In the event that upon any exercise of Warrants evidenced hereby the
number of Warrants exercised shall be less than the total number of Warrants
evidenced hereby, there shall be issued to the holder hereof or his, her or
its assignee, a new Warrant Certificate evidencing the number of Warrants not
exercised.

Notwithstanding anything else in this Warrant Certificate or the Warrant
Agreement, no Warrant may be exercised unless at the time of exercise (i) a
registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock to be issued upon
exercise is effective under the Securities Act and (ii) a prospectus
thereunder relating to the shares of Common Stock is current, except through
"cashless exercise" as provided for in the Warrant Agreement.

   

The Warrant Agreement provides that upon the occurrence of certain events the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants set
forth on the face hereof may, subject to certain conditions, be adjusted. If,
upon exercise of a Warrant, the holder thereof would be entitled to receive a
