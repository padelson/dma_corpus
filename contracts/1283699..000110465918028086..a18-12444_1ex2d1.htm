SoftBank Surviving Entity) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger Transactions.

 



 

Section 3.3. _Treatment of Sprint Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Conversion_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Sprint, T-Mobile, Merger Sub, the holders of any
Sprint Equity Awards or any other person:

 



 

(i) Each Sprint Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into an option to purchase, on the terms and conditions (including,
if applicable, any continuing vesting requirements) under the applicable plan
and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (A)
that number of shares of T-Mobile Common Stock, rounded

 



      
 

 



 

down to the nearest whole share, equal to the product determined by
multiplying (I) the total number of shares of Sprint Common Stock subject to
such Sprint Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (II) the
Exchange Ratio, (B) at a per-share exercise price, rounded up to the nearest
whole cent, equal to the quotient determined by dividing (I) the exercise
price per share of Sprint Common Stock covered by such Sprint Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (II) the Exchange Ratio.

 



 

(ii) Each Sprint RSU Award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into a T-Mobile RSU Award on the terms and conditions (including, if
applicable, any continuing vesting requirements) under the applicable plan and
award agreement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, with
respect to a number of shares of T-Mobile Common Stock, rounded up to the
nearest whole share, determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of
Sprint Common Stock subject to such Sprint RSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio. Any accrued but unpaid dividend
equivalents with respect to any Sprint RSU Award will be assumed and become an
obligation with respect to the applicable T-Mobile RSU Award.

 



 

(iii) Each Sprint PSU Award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into a T-Mobile RSU Award on the terms and conditions (including, if
applicable, any continuing vesting requirements, but not the performance-based
vesting conditions applicable to such Sprint PSU Awards immediately prior to
the Effective Time) under the applicable plan and award agreement in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to a number of shares of
T-Mobile Common Stock, rounded up to the nearest whole share, determined by
multiplying (A) the number of shares of Sprint Common Stock subject to such
Sprint PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Exchange
Ratio. Any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents with respect to any such
Sprint PSU Award will be assumed and become an obligation with respect to the
applicable T-Mobile RSU Award. For purposes of this _Section 3.3(a)(iii)_,
the number of shares of Sprint Common Stock subject to each Sprint PSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be based on the assumed level of
performance to equal (1) in the case of a Sprint TIA Award the greatest of (x)
the volume-weighted average price of Sprint Common Stock over any 150-calendar
day period as specified in the applicable award agreement as of the Effective
Time, (y) the volume-weighted average price of Sprint Common Stock over the
five (5) consecutive trading day period ending with the second (2nd) complete
trading day prior to the Effective Time and (z) the volume-weighted average
price of Sprint Common Stock equal to 100% of the target award; and (2) in the
case of a Sprint PSU Award other than a Sprint TIA Award, in respect of
outstanding performance periods as of the Effective Time, the target number of
shares of Sprint Common Stock underlying such Sprint PSU Award and in respect
of completed performance periods as of the Effective Time, the actual number
of shares of Sprint Common Stock underlying such Sprint PSU Award.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Sprint ESPP_. Prior to the Effective Time, Sprint shall take all actions
necessary or required under the Sprint Employees Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_Sprint ESPP_ ") and applicable Law to, contingent on the Effective Time, (i)
cause the purchase period then underway under the Sprint ESPP (the " _Final
Purchase Period_ "), to the extent that it would otherwise be outstanding at
the Effective Time, to be terminated no later than five (5) business days
prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs; (ii) make any pro rata
adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the Final Purchase Period, but
otherwise treat the Final Purchase Period as a fully effective and completed
purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the Sprint ESPP; and (iii) cause
the exercise (as of no later than five (5) business days prior to the date on
which the Effective Time occurs) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant
to the Sprint ESPP. On such exercise date, Sprint shall apply the funds
credited as of such date pursuant to the Sprint ESPP within each participants
payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of Sprint Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of the Sprint ESPP, and such shares of
Sprint Common Stock shall be outstanding shares of Sprint Common Stock and
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
3.2_.

 



 

(c) _Assumption of Sprint Equity Awards_. Effective as of the Effective Time,
T-Mobile shall assume (i) the Sprint Options, Sprint RSU Awards and Sprint PSU
Awards (any such award, a " _Sprint Equity Award_ ") in accordance with the
terms of this _Section 3.3_ and (ii) sponsorship of each Sprint Equity Plan;
_provided_ that references to Sprint therein shall thereupon be deemed
references to T-Mobile and references to Sprint Common Stock therein shall be
deemed references to T-Mobile Common Stock with appropriate equitable
adjustments to reflect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Corporate Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors
of Sprint or the appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions
providing for the treatment of the Sprint Equity Awards and the Sprint Equity
Plans as contemplated by this _Section 3.3_.

 



 

(e) _Registration Statement_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
T-Mobile shall prepare and file with the SEC a Form S-8 (or any successor
form, or if Form S-8 is not available, such other appropriate forms)
registering a number of shares of T-Mobile Common Stock necessary to fulfill
T-Mobiles obligations under this _Section 3.3_. T-Mobile shall take all
corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of T-Mobile Common Stock for delivery with respect to the Sprint Equity
Awards assumed by it in accordance with this _Section 3.3_. T-Mobile shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses with respect thereto) for so long as any of such assumed Sprint
Equity Awards remain outstanding.

 



 

Section 3.4. _No Dissenters  Rights_. In accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of T-Mobile Common
Stock or Sprint Common Stock in connection with the Merger Transactions.

 



 

Section 3.5. _Exchange of Shares and Certificates; Fractional Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, T-Mobile shall designate a
bank, trust company or nationally recognized stockholder services provider
(the " _Exchange_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Agent_ ") reasonably acceptable to Sprint on terms reasonably acceptable to
Sprint for the purpose of exchanging, in accordance with this _Article III_,
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration. In addition,
on or prior to the Effective Time, T-Mobile shall deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Sprint Common Stock evidence of shares of T-Mobile Common Stock representing
the aggregate amount of shares of T-Mobile Common Stock sufficient to deliver
the Merger Consideration (such shares, the " _Exchange Fund_ ") payable in
respect thereof. The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration to
be issued pursuant to _Section 3.2_ out of the Exchange Fund.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures for the SoftBank US Mergers_. On the Closing Date,
promptly following the SoftBank US Mergers Effective Time, SoftBank shall
cause the certificates (each, a " _SoftBank Certificate_ ") and book-entry
shares (each, a " _SoftBank Book-Entry Share_ ") that immediately prior to the
SoftBank US Mergers Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Starburst
Common Stock and Galaxy Common Stock (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
SoftBank Certificates pursuant to _Section 3.5(j)_) to be surrendered to the
Exchange Agent, and upon such surrender, the holder of such SoftBank
Certificates and such SoftBank Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive,
in exchange therefor, that number of whole shares of T-Mobile Common Stock
(which shall be in book-entry form) that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_, and such SoftBank
Certificates and SoftBank Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.5_, each
SoftBank Certificate or SoftBank Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the applicable pro rata portion of the Galaxy Merger Consideration
or the applicable pro rata portion of the Starburst Merger Consideration, as
applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue for the benefit of
holders of SoftBank Certificates or SoftBank Book-Entry Shares on the Galaxy
Merger Consideration or the Starburst Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of SoftBank Certificates or SoftBank Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures for the Merger_. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) business days
thereafter), the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Sprint Common Stock and whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates pursuant to
_Section 3.5(j)_) to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in a form
reasonably acceptable to T-Mobile and Sprint) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
Certificates pursuant to _Section 3.5(j)_) in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
T-Mobile, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, or, in the
case of a book-entry share (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Sprint Common Stock
and whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, upon the surrender of such Book-Entry Share, and in each case
upon delivery of such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor that number of whole shares of
T-Mobile Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry form) and, if any, cash in
lieu of fractional

 



      
 

 



 

shares as set forth in _Section 3.5(f)_ that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_, and the Certificate
or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If any portion
of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a person other
than the person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-
Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition to the registration of such
Merger Consideration that the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of such
registration in the name of a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.5_, each Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue for the benefit of holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to T-Mobile Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate, SoftBank Certificate, Book-Entry Share or SoftBank Book-Entry
Share with respect to any shares of T-Mobile Common Stock represented thereby,
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such
holder pursuant to _Section 3.5(f)_, in each case until the later of the
surrender of such Certificate, SoftBank Certificate, Book-Entry Share or
SoftBank Book-Entry Share in accordance with this _Article III_ and the
payment date for such dividends or distributions.

 



 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Sprint Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration, the Galaxy Merger Consideration and the Starburst Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, SoftBank
Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or SoftBank Book-Entry Shares in accordance
with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been issued (and
paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Sprint
Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates, SoftBank
Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or SoftBank Book-Entry Shares, and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Sprint Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates, SoftBank Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or SoftBank Book-
Entry Shares are presented to T-Mobile, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article III_.

 



 

(f) _Fractional Shares_.

 



 

(i) No certificates or scrip or book-entry notations representing fractional
shares of T-Mobile Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, SoftBank Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or SoftBank
Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of T-Mobile.

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Sprint Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of T-Mobile
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount as determined below. As promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of
(A) the aggregate number of shares of T-Mobile Common Stock delivered to the
Exchange Agent by T-Mobile for issuance to holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares over (B) the aggregate number of whole shares of T-Mobile Common
Stock to be distributed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (such
excess being herein referred to as the " _Excess Shares_ "). As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for such
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, shall sell the Excess Shares at
then prevailing prices on NASDAQ, all in the manner provided herein.

 



 

(iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent on NASDAQ shall be
executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of
any such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for
such holders. The net proceeds of any such sale or sales of Excess Shares to
be distributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
reduced by any and all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket
transaction costs, as well as any expenses, of the Exchange Agent incurred in
connection with such sale or sales. The Exchange Agent shall determine the
portion of such net proceeds to which each holder of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the
aggregate net proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of
the fractional share interest to which such holder of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares is entitled (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares of such holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate
amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares are entitled. As soon as practicable after the determination
of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares with respect to any fractional share interests, the Exchange
Agent shall promptly pay such amounts to such holders subject to and in
accordance with this _Section 3.5(f)_.

 



 

(g) _Return of Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
made available to the Exchange Agent that remains undistributed to the holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for one year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to T-Mobile, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article
III_ shall thereafter be entitled to look only to T-Mobile for payment of
their claim for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares and
any dividends or distributions with respect to T-Mobile Common Stock.

 



 

(h) _No Liability_. None of Sprint, T-Mobile, Merger Sub, Merger Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the SoftBank Surviving Entity, the DT Parties, the
SoftBank Parties or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,

 



      
 

 



 

escheat or similar law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been
surrendered prior to seven years after the Effective Time, or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any cash, any shares of T-Mobile Common
Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of T-Mobile Common Stock or any
dividends or distributions with respect to T-Mobile Common Stock in respect of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash or dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of T-Mobile, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of T-Mobile and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement (including any shares of T-Mobile Common Stock otherwise
required to be delivered pursuant to this _Article III_) such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
(or delivery) under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited
with the relevant Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

(j) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate or SoftBank
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate or SoftBank
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by T-Mobile or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as T-Mobile or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate or SoftBank Certificate, as applicable, the Exchange Agent shall
deliver (i) in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Sprint Common Stock
formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
T-Mobile Common Stock, and any unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of
T-Mobile Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this
Agreement and (ii) in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed SoftBank
Certificate, the applicable pro rata portion of the Galaxy Merger
Consideration or the applicable pro rata portion of the Starburst Merger
Consideration, as applicable, with respect to the shares of Galaxy Common
Stock or Starburst Common Stock formerly represented thereby and any unpaid
dividends and distributions on shares of T-Mobile Common Stock deliverable in
respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.6. _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Sprint Common Stock or T-Mobile
Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares,
dividend payable in stock or other securities or other similar transaction,
the Exchange Ratio and related provisions shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide to the holders of Sprint Common Stock, Galaxy Common Stock, Starburst
Common Stock or Sprint Equity Awards the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange, dividend or other similar transaction. Nothing in this
_Section 3.6_ shall be construed to permit any party to take any action that
is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this
Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.7. _Certain Subsidiaries; Further Assurances_.

 



 

(a) DT shall cause its subsidiaries (other than T-Mobile and its subsidiaries)
to comply with this Agreement. SoftBank shall cause its subsidiaries (other
than Sprint and its subsidiaries) to comply with this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event DT, T-Mobile, SoftBank or Sprint shall have given a Revised
Structure Notice prior to the SoftBank US Mergers Effective Time, the parties
shall take all actions necessary or advisable in order to give effect to the
last sentence of _Section 1.1_.

 



 

(c) At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors, as
applicable, of T-Mobile, the Surviving Corporation and the SoftBank Surviving
Entity shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf
of Sprint, Merger Sub, Merger Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
SoftBank Surviving Entity any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances
and to take and do, in the name and on behalf thereof, any other actions and
things necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
T-Mobile or a subsidiary of T-Mobile, as the case may be, any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets
acquired or to be acquired by T-Mobile or a subsidiary of T-Mobile, as the
case may be, as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger Transactions.

 



 

ARTICLE IV

 



 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_

 



 

Section 4.1. _Representations and Warranties of Sprint_. Except as set forth
in any Sprint SEC Document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since January 1, 2016 (including all exhibits and
other information filed therewith or incorporated therein (including by
reference), regardless of when such exhibits and other information were filed)
and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (as amended prior
to the date of this Agreement, the " _Sprint Filed SEC Documents_ "),
excluding any disclosures in such Sprint Filed SEC Documents contained in any
risk factors section, any section related to forward-looking statements and
other disclosures that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in
nature, or except as disclosed in the disclosure letter delivered by Sprint to
T-Mobile at or prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Sprint
Disclosure Letter_ ") and making reference to the particular subsection of
this Agreement to which exception is being taken ( _provided_ that such
disclosure shall be deemed to qualify that particular subsection and any other
subsection of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from
the face of such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies such other
subsection), Sprint represents and warrants to T-Mobile, Merger Sub, Merger
Company and the DT Parties as follows:

 



 

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of Sprint and its
subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
such concept) under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and
has the requisite corporate or other power, as the case may be, and authority
to carry on its business as now being conducted, except, as to subsidiaries,
for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so organized, existing or in
good standing, or to have such power, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a

 



      
 

 



 

Material Adverse Effect on Sprint. Each of Sprint and its subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Sprint. Sprint has delivered or made
available to T-Mobile prior to the date of this Agreement true and complete
copies of any amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation of Sprint (the "
_Sprint Certificate of Incorporation_ ") and the Bylaws of Sprint not filed
prior to the date of this Agreement with the Sprint Filed SEC Documents.

adoption, which resolutions have not been rescinded, modified or withdrawn in
any way as of the date of this Agreement. A committee of the Board of
Directors of Sprint consisting solely of independent directors of Sprint (the
" _Sprint Independent Committee_ ") (at a meeting duly called and held) has,
by unanimous vote, duly adopted resolutions: (A) determining that entering

other than the SoftBank Parties), and (B) recommending the submission of this
Agreement to the full Board of Directors of Sprint and the approval this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger
Transactions, by the full Board of Directors of Sprint. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by Sprint and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the other parties

creditors rights generally and (B) equitable remedies of specific

 



      
 

 



 

performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief (collectively,
the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ ").

 



 

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the
provisions of this Agreement shall not, conflict with, or result in any
violation or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under,
or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation or loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any
pledge, claim, lien, charge, encumbrance, option, right of first refusal,
preemptive right, hypothecation, mortgage, security interest or other similar
restriction of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ ") upon
any of the properties or assets of Sprint or any of its subsidiaries under,
(A) the Sprint Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of Sprint or the
comparable organizational documents of any of its subsidiaries, (B) any loan

of clauses (A) (with respect to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or
comparable organizational documents of Sprints subsidiaries), (B) and (C),
any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, losses or Liens that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to (1) have

consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, action by or in respect
of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any federal, state, local,

in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Sprint or

applicable to the Sprint SEC Documents, and none of the Sprint SEC Documents
when filed and at their respective effective times, if applicable, contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Prior to the date of this Agreement, Sprint has furnished to
T-Mobile true and complete copies of all comment letters from the SEC since
January 1, 2016 through the date of this Agreement with respect to any of the
Sprint SEC Documents, together with all written responses of Sprint thereto,
other than any such letters and responses that are publicly available on the

respects with the applicable accounting requirements and with the published

the consolidated financial position of Sprint and its consolidated

(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, and whether or not

its subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto)) that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Sprint.

 



 

(iv) Sprint maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) reasonably
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Sprints

procedures that (A) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of Sprint, (B) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of Sprint are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
Sprint and (C) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Sprints assets
that could have a material effect on its financial statements. Since January
1, 2016, none of Sprint, Sprints independent accountants, the Board of
Directors of Sprint or its audit committee has received any written or, to the
knowledge of Sprint, oral notification of any (1) "significant deficiency" in
the internal controls over financial reporting of Sprint, (2) "material
weakness" in the internal controls over financial reporting of Sprint or (3)

Sprint or any committee thereof.

 



 

(v) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Sprint are reasonably designed
to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by Sprint in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Sprint, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of Sprint to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

 



      
 

 



 

(vi) Since January 1, 2016, (A) neither Sprint nor any of its subsidiaries has

or any of its subsidiaries, or unlawful accounting or auditing matters with
respect to Sprint or any of its subsidiaries, and (B) no attorney representing
Sprint or any of its subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Sprint or any of
its subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities Laws,
breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Sprint or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
agents to the Board of Directors of Sprint or any committee thereof or to the
general counsel or chief executive officer of Sprint pursuant to the rules of
the SEC adopted under Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in each case (A)

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Sprint and any of
its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose
or intended effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Sprint or any of its
subsidiaries in the Sprint Financial Statements or otherwise in the Sprint SEC
Documents.

 



 

(viii) Sprint is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
rules and regulations of the NYSE and the applicable listing requirements of
the NYSE.

 



 

(f) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by Sprint specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, and at any time
it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to

orders, writs, injunctions, decrees, arbitration awards, agency requirements,
licenses and permits of any Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Laws_ ")

delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby. No
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Sprint or

aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to (A) have a Material Adverse
Effect on Sprint or (B) prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Sprint and its subsidiaries has
obtained, holds and is in compliance with all permits, licenses,
certifications, approvals, registrations, consents, authorizations,
franchises, variances, exemptions and orders issued or granted by a
Governmental Entity (" _Licenses_ ") necessary to conduct its business as
currently conducted (the " _Sprint Material Licenses_ "), except where the
failure to have any such License, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to (A) have a Material Adverse Effect on Sprint or (B)
prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(ii) Each of Sprint and its subsidiaries is in compliance with its obligations
under each of the Licenses issued or granted to it by the Federal

regulations of the FCC, and with its obligations under each of the Licenses
issued or granted to it by PUCs regulating telecommunications businesses (the
" _Sprint State Licenses_ "), and with its obligations under each of the
Licenses issued or granted to it by foreign Governmental Entities regulating
telecommunications businesses (together with the Sprint Material Licenses, the
Sprint FCC Licenses and the Sprint State Licenses, the " _Sprint
Communications Licenses_ "), in each case, except as, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to Sprint and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

threatened application, petition, objection or other pleading with the FCC,
the FAA or any other Governmental Entity that challenges or questions the

reasonably be expected to be material to Sprint and its subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.

of its subsidiaries. Each of the Sprint Communications Licenses is in full

FCCs 800 MHz Report and Order, or conditions generally applicable to all
similarly situated licenses of comparable spectrum, and is free and clear of

or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to Sprint
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(v) Each lease pursuant to which Sprint or any of its subsidiaries has the
right to use wireless spectrum licensed by the FCC is (A) valid and binding,
(B) in compliance with all applicable Laws and (C) enforceable in accordance

would not reasonably be expected to be material to Sprint and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the knowledge of Sprint, each licensee of
such wireless spectrum is in compliance with all of its obligations under the
FCC Rules with respect to each License to which any such lease relates, and,
to the knowledge of Sprint, there are no facts or circumstances that would
reasonably be likely (whether with or without notice, lapse of time or the
occurrence of any other event) to preclude the renewal or extension of any
such lease in the ordinary course of business,

 



      
 

 



 

except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to be material to Sprint and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. None of
Sprint or its subsidiaries has, nor to the knowledge of Sprint has any other
party to any such lease, claimed that any party to any such lease is in breach
or default under such lease, and any past breach or default has been waived,
cured or otherwise settled, in each case, except as, individually or in the

subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No party to any such lease has claimed in

validly issued and are in full force and effect, and are not subject to
proceedings or threatened proceedings that could reasonably be expected to
result in the revocation, modification, restriction, cancellation,
termination, suspension or non-renewal of any such FCC license, in each case,
except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to be material to Sprint and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

such cell sites, microwave paths, fiber routes or other network facilities
have been preceded by the submission to the FCC or any other applicable
Governmental Entity of all required filings, in each case, except as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be
material to Sprint and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. All facilities
constructed by Sprint or its subsidiaries for the purpose of demonstrating
compliance with FCC substantial service or build-out requirements, or
educational use requirements, whether such filings were made by Sprint or a
lessor leasing spectrum to Sprint, remain constructed and are currently being
operated as represented to the FCC, except as, individually or in the

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the
provisions of this Agreement shall not, conflict with, or result in any
violation or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under,

(i) T-Mobile and its subsidiaries have been and are, and the businesses of
T-Mobile and its subsidiaries have been and are being, conducted, in
compliance with all Laws relating to T-Mobile and its subsidiaries or their

or (B) prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. No investigation or review by any Governmental Entity

_T-Mobile Material Licenses_ "), except where the failure to have any such
License, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
(A) have a Material Adverse Effect on T-Mobile or (B) prevent or materially
delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(ii) Each of T-Mobile and its subsidiaries is in compliance with its
obligations under each of the Licenses issued or granted to it by the FCC and

as lessee(s), and the FCC licensees of such spectrum, as lessors (the " _T-
Mobile FCC Licenses_ ") and the rules and regulations of the FCC, and with its
obligations under each of the Licenses issued or granted to it by PUCs
regulating telecommunications businesses (the " _T-Mobile State Licenses_ "),
and with its obligations under each of the Licenses issued or granted to it by
foreign Governmental Entities regulating telecommunications businesses
(together with the T-Mobile Material Licenses, the T-Mobile FCC Licenses and
the T-Mobile State Licenses, the " _T-Mobile Communications Licenses_ "), in
each case, except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to be material to T-Mobile and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(iii) T-Mobile and its subsidiaries are not the subject of, and there are no
pending or, to the knowledge of T-Mobile, threatened proceedings, notices of
violation, orders of forfeiture, complaints or investigations relating to the
T-Mobile Communications Licenses before the FCC, the FAA or any other
Governmental Entity, in each case, except as, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to T-Mobile and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The FCC actions granting all T-Mobile
Communications Licenses, together with all underlying construction permits,
have not been reversed, stayed, enjoined, annulled or suspended, and there is
no pending or, to the knowledge of T-Mobile, threatened application, petition,
objection or other pleading with the FCC, the FAA or any other Governmental

of leases, a valid leasehold interest in, free and clear of all Liens, other

or one of its subsidiaries. Each of the T-Mobile Communications Licenses is in
full force and effect, is granted without conditions, except for those
conditions on the face of such T-Mobile Communications License or conditions
generally applicable to all similarly situated licenses of comparable
spectrum, and is free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), in
each case, except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to be material to T-Mobile and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(v) Each lease pursuant to which T-Mobile or any of its subsidiaries has the
right to use wireless spectrum licensed by the FCC is (i) valid and binding,
(ii) in compliance with all applicable Laws and (iii) enforceable in
accordance with its terms, in each case, except as, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to T-Mobile and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the knowledge of T-Mobile, each licensee of
such wireless spectrum is in compliance with all of its obligations under the
FCC Rules with respect to each License to which any such lease relates, and,
to the knowledge of T-Mobile, there are no facts or circumstances that would
reasonably be likely (whether with or without notice, lapse of time or the
occurrence of any other event) to preclude the renewal or extension of any
such lease in the ordinary

 



      
 

 



 

course of business, except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to be material to T-Mobile and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole. None of T-Mobile or its subsidiaries has, nor to the knowledge of
T-Mobile has any other party to any such lease, claimed that any party to any
such lease is in breach or default under such lease, and any past breach or
default has been waived, cured or otherwise settled, in each case, except as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be
material to T-Mobile and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No party to any
such lease has claimed in writing nor, to the knowledge of T-Mobile, has any
party threatened in writing that T-Mobile or any of its subsidiaries is in
violation of or default under any such lease, or that such party has the right
to terminate such lease, in each case, except as, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to T-Mobile and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the knowledge of T-Mobile, all FCC licenses
underlying all such leases were validly issued and are in full force and
effect, and are not subject to proceedings or threatened proceedings that
could reasonably be expected to result in the revocation, modification,
restriction, cancellation, termination, suspension or non-renewal of any such
FCC license, in each case, except as, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to be material to T-Mobile and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

 



 

(vi) All of the currently operating cell sites, microwave paths, fiber routes
and other network facilities of T-Mobile and its subsidiaries in respect of
which a filing with the FCC or any other Governmental Entity was required have
been constructed and are currently operated as represented to the FCC or such
other Governmental Entity in currently effective filings, and modifications to
such cell sites, microwave paths, fiber routes or other network facilities
have been preceded by the submission to the FCC or any other applicable
Governmental Entity of all required filings, in each case, except as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be
material to T-Mobile and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. All facilities
constructed by T-Mobile or its subsidiaries for the purpose of demonstrating
compliance with FCC substantial service or build-out requirements, or
educational use requirements, whether such filings were made by T-Mobile or a
lessor leasing spectrum to T-Mobile, remain constructed and are currently
being operated as represented to the FCC, except as, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to T-Mobile and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to T-Mobile and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Appropriate notification to the FAA has been
made for each transmission tower owned or leased by T-Mobile and its
subsidiaries to the extent required to be made by T-Mobile or any of its
subsidiaries by, and in accordance with, the FAA Rules, in each case, except
as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be

Communications Act and the rules and regulations of the FCC to hold the
T-Mobile FCC Licenses generally. To the knowledge of T-Mobile, there are no

subsidiaries that would prevent or materially delay the grant of any FCC Form
603 application (or other appropriate form) under the FCC Rules and the
Communications Act with respect to the Merger Transactions.

 



 

(i) _Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of T-Mobile,

Third Party in response to any Sprint Alternative Transaction pursuant to the

forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or the Consent
Solicitation Statement, so that any such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
T-Mobile shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless
each individual who is or was, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director or officer of Sprint or any of its subsidiaries or T-Mobile or who is
as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the
Effective Time, serving at the request of Sprint or any of its subsidiaries as
a director, officer or employee of another person (the " _Indemnified Parties_
"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries,
fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party
is or was a director, officer or employee of Sprint or any of its subsidiaries
or T-Mobile or is or was serving at the request of Sprint or any of its
subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of another person or in
respect of any acts or omissions in their capacities as such directors or
officers occurring prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Indemnified Parties are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by Sprint
or T-Mobile (as applicable) pursuant to the Sprint Certificate of
Incorporation, the Bylaws of Sprint, the governing organizational documents of
any subsidiary of Sprint, the T-Mobile Certificate of Incorporation, the
Bylaws of T-Mobile and any indemnification agreements in existence as of the
date of this Agreement. Without limiting the indemnification obligations set
forth in the immediately preceding sentence, in the event of any such claim,
action, suit or proceeding, (i) each Indemnified Party will be entitled to
advancement of costs and expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim,
action, suit or proceeding from the Surviving Corporation to the same extent
as such Indemnified Party is entitled to advancement of expenses as of the
date of this Agreement by Sprint or T-Mobile (as applicable) pursuant to the
Sprint Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws of Sprint, the governing or
organizational documents of any subsidiary of Sprint, the T-Mobile Certificate
of Incorporation, the Bylaws of T-Mobile and any indemnification agreements in
existence as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , that any person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent
required by the DGCL, the Sprint Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws of
Sprint, the governing organizational documents of any subsidiary of Sprint,
the T-Mobile Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws of T-Mobile and any

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification agreements in existence as of the date of this Agreement, to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification, and (ii) T-Mobile and Sprint (as applicable)
shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, cooperate in the defense of any
such matter. In the event that T-Mobile or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into

of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, T-Mobile and/or

6.6_.

shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by Sprint or T-Mobile (as applicable) or any of their respective
subsidiaries or provide substitute policies for not less than the existing
coverage and with other terms not less favorable to the insured persons with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred prior to the
Effective Time, except that in no event shall T-Mobile be required to pay with
respect to such insurance policies (or substitute insurance policies) of
Sprint or T-Mobile (as applicable) in respect of any one policy year more than
300% of the annual premium payable by Sprint or T-Mobile (as applicable) for
such insurance for the prior 12 months (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if
T-Mobile is unable to obtain the insurance required by this _Section 6.6_ it
shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within
such six-year period for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount, in
respect of each policy year within such period; _provided_ , that in lieu of
the foregoing, Sprint or T-Mobile (as applicable) may obtain at or prior to
the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under Sprints or T-Mobiles
existing directors and officers liability insurance policy (as applicable)
providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if
and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, on an
annual basis, does not exceed the Maximum Amount.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ (i) shall survive the consummation
of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Indemnified
Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and (iii) are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

_Section 6.17_ or _Section 8.2_ or as otherwise explicitly provided in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger

Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether
or not the Merger Transactions are consummated, except that each of T-Mobile
and Sprint shall bear and pay the costs and expenses (other than the fees and
expenses of each partys attorneys and accountants, which shall be borne by
the party incurring such expenses) (collectively, the " _Apportioned Expenses_
") incurred by the parties hereto in connection with (i) the filing, printing
and mailing of the Form S-4 and the Consent Solicitation Statement (including
SEC filing fees), of which Apportioned Expenses each of Sprint and T-Mobile
will pay 50%, and (ii) (A) the filings of the premerger notification and
report forms under the HSR

 



      
 

 



 

Act and similar laws of other jurisdictions (including filing fees) and (B)
FCC filing fees, of which Apportioned Expenses, in each case (A) and (B),
Sprint will pay 33% and T-Mobile will pay 67%.

 



 

Section 6.8. _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release agreed by
Sprint, T-Mobile, SoftBank and DT. Each of Sprint, T-Mobile, SoftBank and DT
agrees that it shall consult with the other parties before issuing any press
release or other public statement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
other public statement, except (a) with the prior consent of Sprint, in the
case of T-Mobile and DT, or T-Mobile, in the case of Sprint and SoftBank, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (b) to the
extent required by applicable Law (or any applicable securities exchange rule
or requirement) or (c) to the extent the information contained therein
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby is
substantially consistent with (x) information included in a press release or

T-Mobile (in the case of Sprint and SoftBank), as applicable, has previously
consented pursuant to clause (a) or (y) a communications plan approved in
writing in advance by T-Mobile and Sprint which has not been modified or
rescinded by T-Mobile and Sprint; _provided_ , that in the case of clause (b),

reasonable best efforts to cause the T-Mobile Common Stock issuable under
_Article III_ to be approved for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official
notice of issuance, at or prior to the SoftBank US Mergers Effective Time.
Prior to the Closing Date, Sprint shall cooperate with T-Mobile and use
reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are necessary or advisable to
cause the Sprint Common Stock to be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered
under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, Sprint shall not voluntarily delist the Sprint
Common Stock from the NYSE.

 



 

Section 6.10. _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Each of SoftBank, Starburst, Galaxy, Sprint and T-Mobile shall use
reasonable best efforts (i) to cause each of the SoftBank US Mergers and the
Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code and (ii) to obtain the opinions of Specified Counsel referred to
in _Section 7.2(e)_ and _Section 7.3(e)_. None of the parties hereto or any
of their respective subsidiaries shall take any action, or allow any
controlled affiliate to take any action, that could reasonably be expected to
prevent or impede such qualification or the ability of counsel to deliver such
opinion.

 



 

(b) If pursuant to this Agreement the SoftBank US Mergers are to be
consummated, T-Mobile hereby requests, and SoftBank shall cause each of
Starburst and Galaxy to deliver to T-Mobile prior to the Closing, (i) a
certificate pursuant to Treasury Regulations Sections 1.1445-2(c)(3) and
1.897-2(h), dated not more than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date and
signed by a responsible corporate officer of Starburst or Galaxy, as
applicable,

 



      
 

 



 

certifying that the equity interests in Starburst and Galaxy, as applicable,
are not "United States real property interests" (as defined in Section
897(c)(1) of the Code) and (ii) a copy of the notification provided to the IRS
regarding such certificate, in accordance with the provisions of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.897-2(h)(2). If pursuant to this Agreement the SoftBank
US Mergers will not be consummated, each of Starburst and Galaxy shall deliver
to T-Mobile prior to the Closing a duly executed certificate of non-foreign
status, substantially in the form of the sample certification contained in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B).

 



 

(c) To the extent Treasury Regulations Section 1.358-6 were to apply with
respect to the SoftBank US Mergers and the Merger, taken together, T-Mobile

(i) grant such approvals and take all such actions as are legally permissible
so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and (ii) otherwise act to
eliminate or, if it is not possible to eliminate, then to minimize the effects
of any such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 6.12. _Conveyance Taxes_. Sprint and T-Mobile shall cooperate in the

Section 6.13. _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) For a period of eighteen (18) months following the Effective Time (the "
_Protection Period_ "), T-Mobile shall provide, or cause to be provided, to
each employee of Sprint or its subsidiaries (i) base salary and base wages
that are each on a basis no less favorable than those in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) short-term or annual cash incentive
compensation opportunities, equity compensation and commission opportunities
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) other benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the benefits provided to such employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time or, commencing with the year
immediately following the year in which the Effective Time occurs, that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than the benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of T-Mobile or its subsidiaries. In addition, during the
Protection Period, T-Mobile shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each
employee of Sprint or its subsidiaries with severance payments and severance
benefits that are no less favorable than the greater of (i) the severance
payments and severance benefits that were provided to such employee
immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) the severance payments and severance
benefits that are provided to similarly situated employees of T-Mobile and its
affiliates from time to time.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time, T-Mobile shall cause, for all purposes
under the benefit plans of T-Mobile or its subsidiaries in which individuals
who were employed by Sprint, T-Mobile or their respective subsidiaries as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Employees_ ") are eligible to
participate following the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Employee
to be credited with his or her years of service with Sprint or T-Mobile or any
of their respective affiliates, as the case may be, before the Effective Time,
to the same extent as such Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time,
to credit for such service under any similar Sprint Benefit Plans or T-Mobile
Benefit Plans, as applicable, except to the extent such credit would result in
a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing: T-Mobile shall, to the extent permitted by the terms of the
applicable New Plans, cause (i) each Employee to be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans that are
welfare benefit plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces
coverage under a comparable Sprint Benefit Plan or T-Mobile Benefit Plan, as
applicable, in which such Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Employee
and his or her covered dependents, and any eligible expenses incurred by such
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date such Employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

 



 

(c) Prior to making any material broad-based communications to Employees
pertaining to employment, compensation or benefits matters addressed in this
Agreement or related, directly or indirectly, to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, each of Sprint and T-Mobile shall provide the other party
with a copy of the intended communication, the other party shall have a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the proposed communication,
and the party seeking to make the communication shall consider in good faith
all comments of such other party.

 



 

(d) If requested by T-Mobile in writing not less than ten (10) business days
before the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of Sprint (or the appropriate
committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as
is necessary to terminate Sprints 401(k) plan (the " _Sprint 401(k) Plan_"),
effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. The form and substance of
such resolutions and any other actions taken in connection with the foregoing
termination shall be subject to the review and approval of T-Mobile (which
review and approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). If the Sprint 401(k) Plan is terminated prior to the Closing Date
pursuant to this Section 6.13(d), then following the Effective Time, the
account balances of the participants in the Sprint 401(k) Plan shall be
distributed to the participants, and T-Mobile shall permit the Employees who
are then actively employed by T-Mobile or its subsidiaries to make rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code including loans) in an amount equal to the full
account balance (including loans) distributed to such Employee from the Sprint
401(k) Plan to T-Mobiles 401(k) plan (the " _T-Mobile 401(k) Plan_").

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Each Employee participating in any Sprint Benefit Plan that is an annual
bonus plan (an " _Annual Bonus Plan_ ") during Sprints fiscal year in which
the Effective Time occurs shall be eligible to receive a bonus equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) such Employees full bonus entitlement
under all such Annual Bonus Plans for Sprints fiscal year in which the
Effective Time occurs, based on the greater of (A) deemed performance at
"target" levels and (B) actual performance through the latest practicable date
prior to the Effective Time, with such level of achievement (1) determined by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Sprint or such other
applicable committee and (2) annualized, on a straight line basis, through the
end of the quarter in which the Closing occurs, by (ii) a fraction, the
numerator of which equals the number of days that have elapsed during such
fiscal year through the Effective Time and the denominator of which equals 365
(a " _Pro-Rata Bonus_ "), payable following the end of Sprints fiscal year in
which the Effective Time occurs (but in no event later than sixty (60) days
following the end of such fiscal year), subject to the applicable Employees
continued employment with T-Mobile, Sprint or any of their respective
affiliates through the end of Sprints fiscal year in which the Effective Time
occurs; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such Employee becomes eligible
for severance payments or severance benefits pursuant to either a Sprint
Benefit Plan or T-Mobile Benefit Plan, as applicable, following the Effective
Time, such Pro-Rata Bonus shall be paid to such Employee within sixty (60)
days following such termination of employment (and such payment shall, if
requested by T-Mobile, Sprint or any of their affiliates, be subject to the
applicable Employees execution and non-revocation of a general release of
claims in a form customarily used by T-Mobile, Sprint or their respective
affiliates for their similarly situated employees).

 



 

(f) T-Mobile hereby agrees and acknowledges that a "change of control" (or
similar phrase) within the meaning of the Sprint Benefit Plans shall occur at
or prior to the Effective Time, as applicable.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.13_ shall (i) be construed to
establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement, contract, policy or arrangement, (ii) limit the ability of Sprint,
T-Mobile or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement,
contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them, (iii) create any third-party beneficiary rights or
obligations in any person (including any Employee) other than the parties to
this Agreement or any right to employment or continued employment or to a
particular term or condition of employment with Sprint, T-Mobile or any of
their respective subsidiaries or affiliates or (iv) limit the right of Sprint,
T-Mobile or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate
the employment or service of any employee or other service provider following
the Closing Date at any time and for any or no reason.

 



 

Section 6.14. _Section 16(b)_. Sprint and T-Mobile shall each take all such
steps as are reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities of Sprint
(including derivative securities) or acquisitions of equity securities of
T-Mobile (including derivative securities) in connection herewith by any
individual who (a) is a director or officer of Sprint or (b) at the Effective
Time, will become a director or officer of T-Mobile, in each case to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.15. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of Sprint and T-Mobile
shall promptly advise the other party of any Effect (a) that, individually or
in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Sprint or T-Mobile, respectively, or (b) that it believes
has caused or constituted or would reasonably be expected to cause or
constitute a breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement such that it would cause a failure of
the applicable condition related to such breach in _Article VII_ if the
Closing were otherwise to occur on the date such Effect occurs; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that a failure to comply with this
_Section 6.15_ shall not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in
_Article VII_ to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect
or breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth
in _Article VII_ to be satisfied.

 



 

Section 6.16. _Certain Litigation_. Each party shall promptly advise the other
party of any litigation commenced before, on or after the date hereof against
such party or any of its directors or officers (in their capacities as such)
by any stockholders of such party (on their own behalf or on behalf of such
party) relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (any
such litigation, " _Stockholder Litigation_ "), and shall keep the other party
reasonably informed regarding any such Stockholder Litigation. With respect to
Stockholder Litigation commenced against Sprint or any of its directors or
officers, Sprint shall give T-Mobile the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of any such Stockholder Litigation and no settlement
shall be offered or agreed to by Sprint without T-Mobiles prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). With respect to Stockholder Litigation commenced against T-Mobile or
any of its directors or officers, T-Mobile shall give Sprint the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any such Stockholder
Litigation, and no settlement shall be offered or agreed to by T-Mobile
without Sprints prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Financing Transaction_ ").

consents are received, Sprint or its applicable subsidiaries shall (and shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable Sprint Notes trustee to,
including by delivering to the Trustee any deliverables required to be

correlative step-up in the tax basis of assets) of any Article IX Indemnitee
shall be taken into account.

 



 

Section 9.3. _Additional Agreements_.

 



 

(a) An Article IX Indemnitee shall notify SoftBank of a third-party claim with
respect to which indemnification may be sought under this _Article IX_
reasonably promptly after

 



      
 

 



 

receiving written notice thereof ( _provided_ , that the failure or delay to
so notify SoftBank shall not affect any Article IX Indemnitees right to
indemnification, or SoftBanks indemnification obligations, under this
_Article IX_, except to the extent SoftBank is materially prejudiced by such
failure or delay). SoftBank shall have the right to assume control of the
defense of any such third-party claim upon written notice to the Article IX
Indemnitee within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the notice referred to in
the preceding sentence, unless such third party claim involves an injunction
or equitable relief, non-monetary claims, or criminal liability (in which
case, the Article IX Indemnitee will have the right to take control and
conduct the defense, compromise and settlement of such third-party claim (but
such third-party claim shall not be compromised or settled without the written
consent of SoftBank, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that (i) as a condition precedent to
SoftBanks right to control such defense, it must first notify the Article IX
Indemnitee in writing within such fifteen (15)-day period that SoftBank will
indemnify the Article IX Indemnitee from and against the entirety of any
Losses of Article IX Indemnitees may suffer resulting from, arising out of,
relating to or caused by the third party claim in accordance with the terms of
this _Article IX_ and (ii) in no event shall SoftBank enter into any
settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
to such third party claim without the prior written consent of the Article IX
Indemnitees (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if SoftBank does not assume control of the
defense of such third-party claim within such fifteen (15)-day period, then
the Article IX Indemnitee shall have the exclusive right to control the
defense thereof. SoftBank shall (and shall cause its affiliates to) cooperate
with the Article IX Indemnitees with respect to any claim for indemnification
under this _Article IX_, including making available all witnesses,
information and materials in its possession or under its control relating
thereto as are reasonably requested by an Article IX Indemnitee.

 



 

(b) If SoftBank (or an applicable withholding agent) is required by applicable
Law to deduct or withhold any Tax from any payment required to be made
pursuant to this _Article IX_, then the amount of the payment shall be
increased as necessary so that after any such deduction or withholding
(including any deductions or withholdings applicable to additional amounts
payable under this provision) the applicable Article IX Indemnitee receives an
amount equal to the amount it would have received had no such deduction or
withholding been required.

 



 

(c) If an Article IX Indemnitee incurs or would incur any Tax liability
arising from the receipt or accrual of any payment received or to be received
pursuant to this _Article IX_, then the amount of the payment payable by
SoftBank shall be increased as necessary so that after taking into account any
such Tax liability (including any Tax liability arising from additional
amounts payable under this provision, and disregarding any Tax Attributes of
such Article IX Indemnitee) the Article IX Indemnitee receives an amount equal
to the amount it would have received had no such Tax liability arisen. To the
extent permitted by applicable Law, SoftBank and the applicable Article IX
Indemnitee agree to treat, for applicable Tax purposes, any indemnification
payment pursuant to this Article IX as an adjustment to the Starburst Merger
Consideration or Galaxy Merger Consideration, as applicable.

 



 

(d) Any payment required to be made pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by the relevant Article IX Indemnitee within fifteen (15) business days after
any of the Article IX Indemnitees makes written demand upon SoftBank, but (in
the case of any payment for Taxes payable) no

 



      
 

 



 

earlier than five (5) days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes are
required to be paid to the relevant Taxing Authority.

 



 

(e) SoftBank and T-Mobile shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and other
Representatives to reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns and in connection with all disputes, audits and other proceedings
relating to Taxes, in each case imposed on or with respect to the SoftBank US
HoldCos or the SoftBank US Mergers, including by maintaining and making
available to each other all records reasonably requested and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or
explanation of any material provided hereunder. SoftBank shall cause the
SoftBank US HoldCos to be in possession, at the SoftBank US Mergers Effective
Time, of all Tax Returns, schedules, work papers and all other material
records and documents relating to Tax matters of the SoftBank US HoldCos for
their respective Tax periods ending on or prior to, or including, the Closing
Date.

 



 

(f) Any Article IX Indemnitees right to indemnification for Losses pursuant
to this _Article IX_ shall not be affected by any investigation conducted, or
knowledge or information acquired or capable of being acquired, by such
Article IX Indemnitee (or any Representative of such Article IX Indemnitee or
its affiliates), whether before or after the date hereof or the Closing Date,
of or with respect to the facts, events or conditions resulting in or giving
rise to such Losses (including the breach of, or inaccuracy in, any
representation or warranty, or the breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant,
agreement or other provision giving rise to such Losses). The waiver of any
condition based upon the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or the
fulfillment of, or compliance with, any covenant or agreement, will not affect
the right to, or amount of, indemnification under this _Article IX_.

 



 

(g) In the event that SoftBank or any of its respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or surviving entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, SoftBank shall cause proper provision to
be made so that the successors and assigns of SoftBank assume the obligations
set forth in this _Article IX_, and such successor, assignee or transferee,
as the case may be, shall be deemed to have assumed the obligations of
SoftBank set forth in this _Article IX_.

capital stock to be designated, respectively, "Common Stock" and "Preferred
Stock." The total number of shares which the Corporation is authorized to
issue is Two Billion One Hundred Million (2,100,000,000) shares. Two Billion
(2,000,000,000) shares shall be Common Stock, par value $0.00001 per share,
and One Hundred Million (100,000,000) shares shall be Preferred Stock, par
value $0.00001 per share.

 



 

(B) _Preferred Stock_.

 



 

1. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series and in such amounts as may be determined by the Board of Directors or by order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction over the Corporation administering any applicable statute of the United States relating to plans of reorganization of corporations, subject to any qualifications, limitations and restrictions set forth elsewhere in this Article IV or in 

      
 

 



 

Article VIII. The voting powers, designations, preferences and relative,
participating, optional or other special rights, if any, and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, of each series of
the Preferred Stock shall be such as are fixed by the Board of Directors or
fixed by such court, the authority to do so being hereby expressly granted,
and as are stated and expressed in a resolution or resolutions adopted by the
Board of Directors or in an order or decree of such court providing for the
issue of such series of Preferred Stock (herein called the " _Certificate of
Designation_ "). The Certificate of Designation as to any series shall,
subject to any qualifications, limitations and restrictions set forth
elsewhere in this Article IV or in Article VIII, (a) designate the series, (b)
fix the dividend rate, if any, of such series, the payment dates for dividends
on shares of such series and the date or dates, or the method of determining

be cumulative, (c) fix the amount or amounts payable on shares of such series
upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
affairs of the Corporation, and (d) state the price or prices or rate or
rates, and adjustments, if any, at which, and the time or times and the terms
and conditions upon which, the shares of such series may be redeemed at the
option of the Corporation or at the option of the holder or holders of shares
of such series or upon the occurrence of a specified event, and state whether
such shares may be redeemed for cash, property or rights, including securities
of the Corporation or other equity securities; and such Certificate of
Designation may (i) limit the number of shares of such series that may be
issued, (ii) provide for a sinking fund for the purchase or redemption of
shares of such series and specify the terms and conditions governing the
operations of any such fund, (iii) grant voting rights to the holders of
shares of such series, (iv) impose conditions or restrictions upon the
creation of indebtedness of the Corporation or upon the issuance of additional
Preferred Stock or other capital stock ranking on a parity therewith, or prior
thereto, with respect to dividends or distribution of assets upon liquidation,
(v) impose conditions or restrictions upon the payment of dividends upon, or
the making of other distributions to, or the acquisition of, shares ranking
junior to such series with respect to dividends or distributions of assets
upon liquidation, (vi) state the time or times, the price or prices or the
rate or rates of exchange and other terms, conditions and adjustments upon
which shares of any such series may be made convertible into, or exchangeable
for, at the option of the holder or the Corporation or upon the occurrence of
a specified event, shares of any other class or classes or of any other series
of Preferred Stock or any other class or classes of stock or other securities
of the Corporation, and (vii) grant such other special rights and impose such
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon as shall be fixed by the
Board of Directors or such court, to the extent not inconsistent with this
Article IV or Article VIII and to the full extent now or hereafter permitted
by the laws of the State of Delaware.

 



 

2. Preferred Stock that is redeemed, purchased or retired by the Corporation shall assume the status of authorized and unissued Preferred Stock and may thereafter, subject to the provisions of any Certificate of Designation providing for the issue of any particular series of Preferred Stock, be reissued in the same manner as authorized and unissued Preferred Stock.

 



 

(C) _Common Stock_. All shares of Common Stock shall be identical except as
expressly set forth in this Article IV. Each share of Common Stock shall have
attributed to it the number of votes set forth in Section (E) below.

 



 

(D) _Rights of Holders of Capital Stock_.

 



 

1. _Holders of Preferred Stock_. Except as such rights may be specifically limited herein, the rights of holders of Preferred Stock shall be as set forth in any Certificate of Designation relating thereto.

 



 

2. _Holders of Common Stock_. The rights of holders of Common Stock shall be as set forth in this Section (D)(2), except with respect to such rights as are set forth in Section (E) of this Article IV.

 



 

(a) _Dividend Rights_. Subject to the prior rights of holders of all classes
of stock at the time outstanding having prior rights as to dividends, the
holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared
by the Board of Directors, out of any assets of the Corporation legally
available therefor, such dividends, distributed ratably among the holders of
the Common Stock in proportion to the number of shares of such Common Stock
owned by each such holder, as may be declared from time to time by the Board
of Directors.

 



 

(b) _Liquidation Preference_. Subject to the prior rights of holders of all
classes of stock at the time outstanding having prior rights as to
distributions in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, and after any and all distributions are made in accordance
therewith, in such event, either voluntary or

 



      
 

 



 

involuntary, the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation legally
available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of
the Common Stock in proportion to the number of shares of such Common Stock
owned by each such holder.

 



 

3. _Redemption_.

 



 

(a) Subject to Section (D)(3)(e) of this Article IV, if, at any time, a holder
of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock acquires additional shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock, or is otherwise attributed with ownership of
such shares, that would cause the Corporation to violate (in each case, an "
_FCC Violation_ ") (A) any requirement of the Federal Communications
Commission (" _FCC_ ") regarding foreign ownership (collectively, " _Foreign
Ownership Requirements_ ") or (B) any other rule or regulation of the FCC
applicable to the Corporation, then the Corporation may, at the option of the
Board of Directors, redeem from the holder or holders causing such FCC
Violation a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock to
eliminate the FCC Violation by paying in cash therefor a sum equal to the
Redemption Price. The " _Redemption Price_ " (herein so called) shall equal
such price as is mutually determined by such stockholders and the Corporation,
or, if no mutually acceptable agreement can be reached, shall equal either (i)
seventy-five percent (75%) of the fair market value of the Common Stock (the "
_Common Stock Fair Market Value_ ") or the Fair Market Value of the Preferred
Stock, as applicable, where such holder caused the FCC Violation, or (ii) one
hundred percent (100%) of the Common Stock Fair Market Value or the Fair
Market Value of the Preferred Stock, as applicable, where the FCC Violation
was caused by no fault of the holder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
determination of whether such party caused the FCC Violation shall be made, in
good faith, by the disinterested members of the Board of Directors. As used in
this Section (D)(3), the Common Stock Fair Market Value shall be determined as
follows:

 



 

(i) if the Common Stock is publicly traded at the time of determination, the
average of the closing prices for the Common Stock on all domestic securities
exchanges on which the Common Stock may at the time be listed, or, if there
have been no sales of the Common Stock on any such exchange on such day, the
average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices for the Common Stock on all
such exchanges at the end of such day, or, if on any day the Common Stock is
not so listed, the average of the representative bid and asked prices for the
Common Stock quoted on the NASDAQ system as of the close of trading on such
day, or if on any day such security is not quoted in the NASDAQ system, the
average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices for the Common Stock on
such day in the domestic over-the-counter market as reported by the Pink
Sheets, LLC, or any similar successor organization, in each such case averaged
over the 30-day period ending three days prior to the Redemption Date (as
defined in Section (D)(3)(b) of this Article IV); and

 



 

(ii) if the Common Stock is not publicly traded at the time of determination
then, the fair value of the Common Stock as determined in good faith by the
disinterested members of the Board of Directors.

 



 

As used in this Section (D)(3), the Preferred Stock Fair Market Value shall
mean the value determined by multiplying the Common Stock Fair Market Value by
the number of shares of Common Stock into which the share of Preferred Stock
is then convertible.

 



 

(b) At least five (5) but no more than thirty (30) days prior to any date on
which Common Stock or Preferred Stock is to be redeemed (a " _Redemption Date_
"), written notice shall be sent by mail, first class postage prepaid,
overnight mail, facsimile, or electronic mail to each holder of record (at the
close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice
is given) of the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock to be redeemed, at
the address last shown on the records of the Corporation for such holder,
notifying such holder of the redemption to be effected, specifying the number
of shares to be redeemed from such holder, the Redemption Date, the Redemption
Price, the place at which payment may be obtained and calling upon such holder
to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated,
his, her or its certificate or certificates representing the shares to be
redeemed (the " _Redemption Notice_ "). Except as provided in Section
(D)(3)(c) of this Article IV, on or after the Redemption Date, each holder of
shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender to
the Corporation the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in
the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon
the Redemption Price of such shares shall be payable to the order of the
person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner
thereof and each surrendered

 



      
 

 



 

certificate shall be canceled. In the event less than all the shares
represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be
issued representing the unredeemed shares.

 



 

(c) From and after the Redemption Date, unless there shall have been a default
in payment of the Redemption Price, all rights of the holders of shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock designated for redemption in the Redemption
Notice as holders of such shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock (except
the right to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of
their certificate or certificates) shall cease with respect to such shares,
and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the
Corporation or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. If the
funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of shares of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock on any Redemption Date are insufficient to redeem the
total number of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock to be redeemed on
such date, those funds which are legally available will be used to redeem the
maximum possible number of such shares ratably among the holders of such
shares to be redeemed based upon their holdings of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock to be redeemed. The shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock not
redeemed shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and
preferences provided herein. At any time thereafter when additional funds of
the Corporation are legally available for the redemption of shares of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock, such funds will immediately be used to redeem the
balance of the shares which the Corporation has become obligated to redeem on
any Redemption Date but which it has not redeemed.

 



 

(d) Prior to effecting any such redemption, the Corporation shall provide any
holder of Common Stock or Preferred Stock to be redeemed with reasonable prior
written notice of the reason giving rise to the Corporations redemption right
and, if requested to do so by such holder, the Corporation shall reasonably
cooperate with such affected holder in arranging another method to minimize or
eliminate the reason giving rise to the Corporations redemption right,
including, but not limited to and not in any particular order of priority,
preparing and filing waiver requests with the FCC, developing alternative
ownership structures, assisting with a sale of such holders interest in the
Corporation, amending the Corporations Certificate of Incorporation and
obtaining FCC approvals for such transaction.

 



 

(e) The provisions of Sections (D)(3)(a) through (D)(3)(d) of this Article IV
shall not apply to the DT Stockholder or the SoftBank Stockholder] (each as
defined in that certain Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, dated as
of [], 201[], by and among the Corporation, Deutsche Telekom AG and SoftBank
Group Corp., as it may be amended from time to time (the " _Stockholders 
Agreement_")) (each, a " _Stockholder_ ", and collectively, the "
_Stockholders_ "), any acquisition of shares of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock by a Stockholder or any of its subsidiaries, or any ownership of such
shares otherwise attributed to a Stockholder or any of its subsidiaries, and
the Corporation shall not have the authority under Sections (D)(3)(a) through
(D)(3)(d) of this Article IV to redeem any shares of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock Beneficially Owned, directly or indirectly, by a Stockholder or any of
its subsidiaries, in each case notwithstanding anything to the contrary
therein. In the event that any waivers or approvals are required from the FCC
in order for a Stockholder or any of its subsidiaries to acquire or hold
Common Stock or Preferred Stock, such Stockholder and its subsidiaries shall
cooperate to secure such waivers or approvals and abide by any conditions
related to such waivers or approvals.

 



 

(E) _Voting Rights_.

 



 

1. _Common Stock_. The holders of Common Stock shall have the right to vote on every matter submitted to a vote of the holders of capital stock of the Corporation other than any matter on which only the holders of one or more other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation are entitled to vote separately as a class.

 



 

2. _Preferred Stock_. Except as specifically limited herein, the holders of Preferred Stock shall have such voting rights as shall be set forth in any Certificate of Designation relating thereto.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V 
POWER TO AMEND BYLAWS**

 



 

(A) _Board of Directors_. Except as otherwise provided in this Fifth Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as it may be amended from time to
time, this " _Certificate of Incorporation_ ") and subject to any additional
requirements expressly set forth in the Bylaws of the Corporation, the Board
of Directors is expressly

 



      
 

 



 

authorized, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then
serving, to make, adopt, alter, amend, and repeal from time to time the Bylaws
of the Corporation and make from time to time new Bylaws of the Corporation
(subject to the right of the stockholders entitled to vote thereon to adopt,
alter, amend, and repeal Bylaws made by the Board of Directors or to make new
Bylaws).

 



 

(B) _Stockholders_. The stockholders of the Corporation may adopt, alter,
amend, or repeal Bylaws made by the Board of Directors or make new Bylaws upon
the affirmative vote of the holders of shares having a majority of the
aggregate voting power of all of the outstanding shares of the Corporations
capital stock then entitled to vote thereon, subject to any additional
requirements in the Bylaws of the Corporation.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS**

 



 

(A) _Number, Election and Term of Directors_. Subject to the provisions of
Article III of the Stockholders Agreement, which are hereby incorporated by
reference herein:

 



 

1. The number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the Bylaws of the Corporation, or as provided in accordance with any Certificate of Designation. All of the directors of the Corporation shall be of one class and shall be elected annually. Each director shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and, the foregoing notwithstanding, shall serve until his successor shall have been duly elected and qualified or until his earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal.

 



 

(B) _Vacancies_. Any vacancies of the Board of Directors resulting from death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other reason
may be filled as provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation.

 



 

(C) _Resignation; Retirement; Death; Removal_. Subject to the rights of the
holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, any
director may be removed from office at any time, with or without cause, by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of
all of the outstanding shares of the Corporations capital stock entitled to
elect such director, voting separately as a class, at a duly organized meeting
of stockholders or by written consent.

 



 

(D) _Written Ballots not Required_. Elections of directors need not be by
written ballot unless the Bylaws of the Corporation shall so provide.

 



 

(E) _Corporate Opportunity Matters_.

 



 

1. Except as set forth in Section (E)(2) of this Article VI, to the extent permitted by the DGCL, if any non-employee director (or any of his or her affiliates) acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity in the same or similar activity or line of business as the Corporation, the Corporation shall have no interest or expectancy in being offered by such non-employee director any opportunity to participate in such corporate opportunity, any such interest or expectancy being hereby renounced, so that, as a result of such renunciation and without limiting the scope of such renunciation, such person (a) shall have no duty to communicate or present such corporate opportunity to the Corporation and (b) shall have the right to hold any such corporate opportunity for its (and its officers, directors, agents, stockholders or affiliates) own account or to recommend, sell, assign or transfer such corporate opportunity to any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, governmental entity or other entity of any kind or nature (each, a " _Person_ ") other than the Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not preclude or prevent the Corporation from pursuing any corporate opportunity that may be presented to it by any means.

 



 

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section (E)(1) of this Article VI, the Corporation does not renounce any interest or expectancy it may have in any corporate opportunity that is offered to any non-employee director, if such opportunity is expressly offered to such non-employee director (or his or her affiliates) solely in, and as a direct result of, his or her capacity as a director of the Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII 
MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS; ACTION WITHOUT A MEETING**

 



 

(A) _Meetings of Stockholders_. Meetings of stockholders may be held within or
without the State of Delaware, as the Bylaws of the Corporation may provide.
Special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation (i) may be called, for
any purpose or purposes, by the chairperson of the Board of Directors or the
chief executive officer and (ii) shall be called by the Secretary of the
Corporation at the request of (a) a majority of the Board of Directors or (b)
for so long as the DT Stockholders Voting Percentage (as defined in the
Stockholders Agreement) is twenty-five percent (25%) or greater, the holders
of not less than thirty-three and one third percent (33-1/3%) of the voting
power of all of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote generally for the election of directors, which such request must be in
writing, shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting (which
shall be included in the notice of such meeting) and shall include all
information required to be delivered pursuant to the notice requirements set
forth in the Bylaws of the Corporation in order for nominations or business,
as applicable, to be properly brought before a meeting by a stockholder. If at
any time the DT Stockholders Voting Percentage (as defined in the
Stockholders Agreement) is less than twenty-five percent (25%), the
stockholders ability to request a special meeting of stockholders pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence shall forever terminate. Each special
meeting shall be held within a reasonable time after being called in
accordance with the preceding sentence. Advance notice of stockholder
nominations for the election of directors and of business to be brought by
stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall
be given in the manner provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation. The books of
the Corporation may be kept (subject to any provision contained in the
statutes) outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be
designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or in the Bylaws of the
Corporation.

 



 

(B) _Stockholder Action by Written Consent_. For so long as the DT
Stockholders Voting Percentage (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) is
twenty-five percent (25%) or greater, any action required or permitted to be
taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a
meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in
writing setting forth the action so taken shall be signed by the holders of

 **ARTICLE IX 
INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

(A) The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL in
effect on the date of the effectiveness of this Certificate of Incorporation,
and to such greater extent as the DGCL may thereafter permit, indemnify any
person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative by reason of the fact that he is or
was a director, manager, member, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, manager, member, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments,
liabilities, losses, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding.

 



 

(B) To the extent that a director, manager, member, officer, employee or agent
of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense
of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section (A) of this Article
IX, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be
indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.

 



 

(C) Any indemnification under Section (A) of this Article IX (unless ordered
by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the
specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director,
officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met
the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL. Such determination
shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum
consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or
proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if
obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent
legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders of the
Corporation.

 



 

(D) Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an officer, director, a
manager of a Corporation limited liability company, or a member of a
management committee of a Corporation limited liability company, in defending
any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or
proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of such director, officer, manager or member to repay such
amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article IX. Such expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred by other employees and agents may be so
paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems
appropriate.

 



      
 

 



 

(E) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, the other sections of this Article IX shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law, Bylaw, agreement, vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in
an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office.

 



 

(F) The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was a director, officer, manager, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, manager, member, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in
any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under
the provisions of Section 145 of the DGCL.

 



 

(G) For purposes of this Article IX, references to "the Corporation" shall
include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or joint venturer or
other enterprise (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a
consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would
have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, managers,
members, employees or agents so that any person who is or was a director,
officer, manager, member, employee or agent of such constituent corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, or joint venturer or other enterprise,
or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, or joint venturer or other enterprise
as a director, officer, manager, member, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of
this Article IX with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, or joint venturer or other enterprise
as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate
existence had continued.

 



 

(H) For purposes of this Article IX, (i) references to "other enterprises"
shall include employee benefit plans, including without limitation, any plan
of the Corporation which is governed by the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to time (collectively, " _Employee
Benefit Plans_ "), (ii) references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes
assessed on a person with respect to an Employee Benefit Plan, (iii)
references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any
service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which
imposes duties on, or involves service by, such director, officer, employee or
agent with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, its participants or
beneficiaries, and (iv) a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and
beneficiaries of an Employee Benefit Plan shall be deemed to have acted in a
manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to
in this Article IX.

 



 

(I) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article IX shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized
or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
manager, member, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

 



 

(J) The provisions of this Article IX shall be deemed to be a contract between
the Corporation and each director, officer, employee or agent who serves in
such capacity at any time while this Article IX is in effect. Any repeal or
modification of this Article IX shall be prospective only, and shall not
adversely affect any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any
state of facts then or theretofore existing or any action, suit or proceeding
theretofore or thereafter brought based in whole or in part upon any such
state of facts, whether such state of facts was then known or later known.

 

 ** **

 

 **ARTICLE X 
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

 



 

A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, as the same
exists or

 



      
 

 



 

hereafter may be amended or replaced, or (iv) for any transaction from which
the director derived any improper personal benefit. If the DGCL is amended
after the date of filing this Certificate of Incorporation to authorize
corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of
directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation, in addition to
the limitation on personal liability provided herein, shall be limited to the
fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended. Any repeal or modification
of this Article X shall be prospective only, and shall not adversely affect
any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation
existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI 
AMENDMENTS TO CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION**

 



 

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or
hereafter prescribed by law and subject to Article VIII, and all rights and
powers conferred herein on stockholders, directors and officers are subject to
this reserved power; _provided that_ , notwithstanding the fact that a lesser

These Sixth Amended and Restated Bylaws (these " _Bylaws_ ") of T-Mobile US,

governed by, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "

the event of a direct conflict between the provisions of these Bylaws and the
mandatory provisions of the Delaware Corporation Law or the provisions of the
Certificate of Incorporation, such provisions of the Delaware Corporation Law
or the Certificate of Incorporation, as the case may be, will be controlling.

 **ARTICLE II 
MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS**

 



 

1. The annual meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors and the transaction of such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting shall be held on such date, and at such time and place, either within or without the State of Delaware, or solely by means of remote communication pursuant to Section 211(a)(2) of the Delaware Corporation Law, as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting.

 



 

2. Written or printed notice of the annual meeting, stating the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, shall be given by the Corporation not less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, either personally, by electronic transmission in the manner provided in Section 232 of the Delaware Corporation Law (except to the extent prohibited by Section 232(e) of the

      
 

 



 

Delaware Corporation Law) or by mail, to each stockholder of record entitled
to vote at such meeting.

 



 

3. Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called only as set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation. A special meeting of stockholders shall be held on such date, and at such time and place, within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be stated in the notice of the meeting.

 



 

4. Written or printed notice of the special meeting, stating the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given by the Corporation not less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, either personally, by electronic transmission in the manner provided in Section 232 of the Delaware Corporation Law (except to the extent prohibited by Section 232(e) of the Delaware Corporation Law) or by mail, to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting.

 



 

5. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice.

 



 

6. The Corporation shall prepare, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting of stockholders ( _provided_ , _however_ , that if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10) days before the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth (10th) day before the meeting date), arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares of each class of capital stock registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided in the notice of the meeting, or at the principal place of business of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, the list shall also be produced and kept at the place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, such list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Except as provided by applicable law, the stock ledger of the Corporation shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger and the list of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders.

 



 

7. At each meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders holding issued and outstanding capital stock of the Corporation having not less than a majority of the votes of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. Where a separate vote by a class or classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation is required on any matter at a meeting of stockholders, the stockholders holding issued and outstanding shares of such class or

 



      
 

 



 

classes or series having not less than a majority of the votes of such class
or classes or series entitled to vote thereon, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with
respect to such separate vote. If, however, a quorum shall not be present or
represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the chairperson of such
meeting shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without
notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present
or represented. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by the
subsequent withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum. At such
adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented any
business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as
originally notified. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or,
if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting,
a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record
entitled to vote at the meeting.

 



 

8. When a quorum is present or represented at any meeting, unless otherwise required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, the election of directors and any advisory vote on the frequency of stockholder votes related to the compensation of executives required by Section 14A(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (" _Exchange Act_ "), shall be decided by a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting in person or by proxy by the holders of stock entitled to vote thereon. When a quorum is present or represented at any meeting, unless a different or minimum vote is provided applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, in which case such different or minimum vote shall be the required vote on such matter, any matter, other than the election of directors and an advisory vote on the frequency of stockholder votes related to the compensation of executives required by Section 14A(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, brought before any meeting of stockholders shall be decided by the vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy in favor of such action by the holders of stock entitled to vote thereon. For the avoidance of doubt, abstentions and, except as may be required pursuant to the rules of any exchange where the securities of the Corporation may be listed, broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast for such purposes.

 



 

9. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, in the Certificate of Incorporation, or in these Bylaws, at every meeting of the stockholders, each stockholder entitled to vote thereat shall be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may, by written instrument, electronic transmission or any other means permitted under Section 212 of the Delaware Corporation Law, authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, but no proxy shall be voted after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Such proxy shall be filed with the secretary of the Corporation before or at the time of the meeting. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the secretary of the Corporation a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot.

 



 

10. At every meeting of stockholders, the chairperson of the Board of Directors, or in his or her absence or inability to act, the chief executive officer, or in his or her absence or

 



      
 

 



 

inability to act, the person whom the chief executive officer shall appoint,
shall act as presiding chairperson of, and preside at, the meeting. The
secretary, or in his or her absence or inability act, the person whom the
presiding chairperson of the meeting shall appoint as secretary of the
meeting, shall act as secretary of the meeting and keep the minutes thereof.
The Board of Directors of the Corporation may adopt by resolution such rules
and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of the stockholders as it shall
deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with these Bylaws or any
rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Directors (or in the absence of
any rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Directors), the presiding
chairperson of any meeting of the stockholders shall have the right and
authority to convene, recess and adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules,
regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such
presiding chairperson, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting.
Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of
Directors or prescribed by the presiding chairperson of the meeting, may
include, without limitation, the following: (a) the order of business for the
meeting; (b) the determination of when the polls shall open and close for any
given matter to be voted on at the meeting; (c) rules and procedures for
maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (d)
limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders
of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or
such other persons as the presiding chairperson of the meeting shall
determine; (e) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for
the commencement thereof; (f) limitations on the time allotted to questions or
comments by participants; and (g) policies and procedures with respect to the
adjournment of such meeting.

 



 

11. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, the provisions of this Section 11 shall apply to nominations of directors for election to the Board of Directors. Nominations of directors for election to the Board of Directors must be made by the Board of Directors or by any Eligible Stockholder (as defined below). Nominations, other than those made by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, may be made only by an Eligible Stockholder and only if (1) such stockholder has provided timely notice thereof in accordance with this Section 11, including timely updates and supplements thereof in accordance with Section 13, in each case in proper form in writing to the secretary of the Corporation, and (2) such stockholder has provided, or caused to be provided, the information and disclosures required by this Section 11. To be timely, a stockholders notice must be received by the secretary of the Corporation at the executive offices of the Corporation (i) in the case of an annual meeting, not later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) calendar day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) calendar day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting, regardless of whether the party or parties seeking to make the nominations are seeking to include the nominees in managements proxy materials or in its or their own or other proxy materials; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) calendar days before or more than sixty (60) calendar days after such anniversary date, notice must be received by the secretary of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) calendar day prior to such annual meeting but not later than the close of business on the latter of the ninetieth (90th) calendar day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) calendar day following the calendar day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation, and (ii) in the case of a special meeting, not later than the close of business on the sixtieth (60th) calendar day nor earlier than the close of

special meeting, the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public
announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and, if
applicable, of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected
at such meeting. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an
annual meeting, or the public announcement thereof, commence a new time period
for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above. Such notice shall
contain the following:

notice to the Corporation to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than

adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, or the public announcement
thereof, commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholders notice
as described above. Such notice shall contain the following:

or in its own or other proxy materials.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be
conducted at a meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this Section 12. The presiding chairperson of the meeting shall, if the facts
warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly

15. The Board of Directors, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, may, and shall if required by law, appoint one or more inspectors, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof and make a written report thereof. The Board of Directors may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act.

If shares are represented by certificates, such certificates shall be in a form approved by the Board of Directors.

 



 

If the Corporation shall be authorized to issue more than one class of stock
or more than one series of any class, the powers, designations, and
preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of
each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or

entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or
exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of
Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than
sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting nor
more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action. If the Board of Directors
so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board of Directors
determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or
before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such
determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is
held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment or
postponement of the meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of
Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned or postponed meeting.

 



 

7. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall request the Board of Directors to fix a record date, which request shall be in proper form and delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation. To be in proper form, such request must be in writing and shall state the purpose or purposes of the action or actions proposed to be taken by written consent. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within ten (10) days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business or to any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporations registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability for any breach of this Agreement that occurred prior to such termination.

 



 

6. _Duties_. DT and the DT Stockholder are entering into this Agreement solely in their capacities as Beneficial Owners of the Shares and nothing in this Agreement shall apply to any Person serving in his or her capacity as a director or officer of T-Mobile.

 



 

7. _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Sprint or SoftBank any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to the Shares. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Shares shall remain vested in and belong to DT and the DT Stockholder, as applicable, and neither Sprint nor SoftBank shall have the authority to direct DT or the DT Stockholder in the voting or disposition of any Shares, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.

 



 

8. _No Obligation to Exercise_. No provision of this Agreement shall require DT or the DT Stockholder to exercise any option, warrant, convertible security or other security or contract right convertible into shares of T-Mobile Common Stock; _provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that upon any such exercise, the shares of T-Mobile Common Stock acquired by DT or the DT Stockholder pursuant thereto shall be Shares for all purposes hereunder.

 



 

9. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

9.1 _Injunctive Relief_. The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, and that monetary

 



      
 

 



 

damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
referred to in _Section 9.5_, without proof of actual damages (and each party
hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with any such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not
to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, or to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach.

 



 

9.2 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. No party may directly or indirectly
assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of the other party; _provided_
that, without the written consent of the other parties, DT may assign any of
its rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to any Person that
will be a successor to or that will acquire Control of DT, whether by merger,
consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. Any purported
direct or indirect assignment in violation of this _Section 9.2_ shall be
null and void _ab initio_.

 



 

9.3 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment, modification or discharge of this
Agreement, and no waiver hereunder, and no extension of time for the
performance of any of the obligations hereunder, shall be valid or binding
unless set forth in writing and duly executed by the parties. Any such waiver
shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter described
in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of any party granting
any waiver in any other respect or at any other time. The waiver by any party
of a breach of, or a default under, any of the provisions hereof, or to
exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall not be construed as a waiver
of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of
such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. Except as expressly provided
in this Agreement, the rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and
none is exclusive of any other, or of any rights or remedies that any party
may otherwise have at law or in equity.

 



 

9.4 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications
under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if
delivered personally or delivered by electronic mail (which is confirmed) or

Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, Delaware, (b)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by motion
or other request for leave from such court, and (c) agrees that it will not
bring any such action in any court other than the Court of Chancery for the
State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, Delaware, or, if (and only if)
such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the federal court of
the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware, and appellate
courts thereof, or, if (and only if) each of such Court of Chancery for the
State of Delaware and such federal court finds it lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, any state court within the State of Delaware. Service of

invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon a determination that any

the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent

counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties.

9.1 _Injunctive Relief_. The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement

damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy), this being in

to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
for any such breach.

9.2_ shall be null and void _ab initio_.

 



 

9.3 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment, modification or discharge of this
Agreement, and no waiver hereunder, and no extension of time for the
performance of any of the obligations hereunder, shall be valid or binding
unless set forth in writing and duly executed by the parties. Any such waiver
shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter described
in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of any party granting
any waiver in any other respect or at any other time. The waiver by any party
of a breach of, or a default under, any of the provisions hereof, or to
exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall not be construed as a waiver
of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of
such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. Except as expressly provided
in this Agreement, the rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and
none is exclusive of any other, or of any rights or remedies that any party
may otherwise have at law or in equity.

Non-Affiliated Director pursuant to Section 3.1(a), 3.1(b) or 3.1(c), such
other Stockholder.

Section 3.1 are subject to the provisions of Section 6.3. In the event that

under the listing standards of NASDAQ and the applicable rules of the SEC, and
with one of such DT Designees being the Chief Executive Officer of DT (or, if
such Person is unable to serve, another Person designated by DT)); (C) out of
such fourteen Directors, three Directors shall not be designated by the DT
Stockholder, but shall be recommended by the Nominating and Corporate

be evidenced by a majority vote of the members of the CEO Selection
Committee).

 



 

(b) _Specified Actions Requiring Consent of SoftBank_. In addition to any
other vote, consent or approval required by the Companys Organizational
Documents, this Agreement or applicable Law, prior to the SoftBank Specified

(c) _SoftBank Match Right for Sale of the Company_. Subject to Section 6.3,
prior to the SoftBank Match Right Termination Date, the Company shall not, and

"), unless it shall have first complied with the provisions of this Section
3.2(c):

 



 

(i) _Sales Process Initiated by the Company_. If the Company determines to
commence a process pursuant to which it will solicit offers from one or more
Third Parties for a Sale of the Company to a Third Party, then the Company
shall provide written notice to SoftBank at least 20 days prior to soliciting
any such offers from such Third Parties. During such 20 day period, SoftBank
shall have the right to make one bona fide written proposal to the Company for
a Sale of the Company to SoftBank (it

 



      
 

 



 

being understood that, in connection therewith, SoftBank shall be deemed to
waive all of its rights under this Section 3.2(c)(i) with respect to the
process commenced by the Company if it involves any Schedule 6.3 Person (or
Affiliate thereof) as a co-bidder or equity or debt financing source without
the prior written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company). If
SoftBank notifies the Board in writing that it does not intend to submit such
a proposal prior to the end of such 20 day period, then the Company shall not
be obligated to wait until the end of such 20 day period to solicit offers
from Third Parties for a Sale of the Company.

 



 

(ii) _Offer Not In Connection with a Sales Process_.

 



 

(A) If the Company receives a proposal from an Offeror for a Sale of the
Company to such Offeror (other than a proposal received pursuant to a process
commenced by the Company pursuant to Section 3.2(c)(i)), then at least 20 days
(the " _Match Right Period_ "), prior to entering into any binding agreement
to effect a Sale of the Company to such Offeror, the Company shall deliver (1)
a written notice (the " _Match Right Notice_ ") to SoftBank (with a copy to
DT) setting forth the identity of the Offeror, the proposed purchase price,
form of consideration, and material terms and conditions of the proposed Sale
of the Company (collectively, the " _Offeror Proposed Terms_ "), (2) if a form
of proposed definitive agreement with the Offeror has been provided by the
Offeror, a copy of such agreement, and (3) a written certification that the
Company believes in good faith (i) that the Offeror Proposed Terms represent a
bona fide proposal for the Sale of the Company on the Offeror Proposed Terms
and (ii) that a binding agreement for the Sale of the Company could be
obtainable on the Offeror Proposed Terms.

 



 

(B) Following the delivery of a Match Right Notice, SoftBank shall be
entitled, during the Match Right Period, to submit to the Board one (subject
to Section 3.2(c)(ii)(C)) bona fide written proposal containing proposed terms
for a Sale of the Company to SoftBank (the " _SoftBank Proposed Terms_ ") (it
being understood that, in connection therewith, SoftBank shall be deemed to
waive all of its rights under this Section 3.2(c)(ii) with respect to a Sale
of the Company to such Offeror if it involves any Schedule 6.3 Person (or
Affiliate thereof) as a co-bidder or equity or debt financing source without
the prior written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company).

 



 

(C) If, prior to entering into a binding definitive agreement to effect a Sale
of the Company to the Offeror, the Offeror proposes any material decrease to
the purchase price or any material change to the form of consideration in the
Sale of the Company, then the Company shall be required to deliver a new Match
Right Notice to SoftBank (with a copy to DT), and a new Match Right Period
shall commence.

 



 

(D) Subject to Section 3.2(c)(ii)(E), the Company shall not enter into any
binding definitive agreement to effect a Sale of the Company to the Offeror
unless the Board, by a majority vote of the Directors, determines in good
faith, as of or following the end of the Match Right Period, that the Offeror
Proposed Terms are more favorable to the Companys stockholders (other than
SoftBank) than the SoftBank Proposed Terms, if any, submitted to the Board
during the Match Right Period (taking

 



      
 

 



 

into account all relevant circumstances, including legal, financial and
regulatory aspects, all terms and conditions, and the likelihood of
consummation).

 



 

(E) Subject to Section 3.2(c)(ii)(C), if SoftBank notifies the Board in
writing that it does not intend to submit SoftBank Proposed Terms prior to the
end of the Match Right Period, then the Company shall not be obligated to wait
until the end of the Match Right Period to enter into any binding definitive
agreement to effect a Sale of the Company to the Offeror. In addition, subject
to Section 3.2(c)(ii)(C), if SoftBank does not submit SoftBank Proposed Terms
prior to the end of the Match Right Period with respect to any proposed Sale
of the Company to an Offeror, then SoftBank shall be deemed to have waived all
of its rights under this Section 3.2(c)(ii) with respect to any proposed Sale
of the Company to such Offeror.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Organizational Documents Actions_. In addition to any other vote,
consent or approval required by the Companys Organizational Documents, this
Agreement or applicable Law, for so long as a Stockholders Voting Percentage
is 5% or greater, the Company shall not amend or seek to amend its
Organizational Documents (including the creation of any stockholder rights
plan or other amendment intended to limit such Stockholders ownership or
acquisition of securities of the Company) in any manner that could limit,
restrict or adversely affect such Stockholder or its rights thereunder without
the prior written consent of such Stockholder, which consent may be withheld
in its sole discretion.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Debt Defaults_. The Company shall notify DT any time that it is
reasonably likely that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will default on
any Indebtedness (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) with a
principal amount greater than $75 million (a " _Potential Default_ ").
Thereupon, DT shall have the right, but not the obligation, to provide or to
have its Affiliates provide new debt financing to the Company or such
Subsidiary up to the amount of the Indebtedness that is the subject of the
Potential Default plus any applicable prepayment or other penalties, on the
same terms and conditions as such Indebtedness (together with any waiver of
the Potential Default). If DT elects to provide or to cause its Affiliates to
provide the Company or such Subsidiary with new debt financing, the Company
and such Subsidiary shall take any actions reasonably requested by DT (i) to
prepare documentation reflecting the terms and conditions of the new debt
financing; (ii) to repay the Indebtedness that is the subject of the Potential
Default; and (iii) to take any other action necessary or desirable to avert
the Potential Default.

rights set forth herein, in the Companys Organizational Documents or
otherwise: (i) such Stockholder shall be entitled to consult with the officers

including managements proposed annual operating plans, and, upon request,
members of management will meet with representatives of such Stockholder at
mutually agreeable times and places for such consultation, including to review
progress in achieving said plans; _provided_ that such consultation shall not

 



      
 

 



 

unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries
and such Stockholder shall be responsible for any out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by the Company in connection with such consultation; (ii)
the Company shall furnish such Stockholder with such available financial and
operating data and other information with respect to the business and
properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries as such Stockholder may
reasonably request; _provided_ that such request must be made through the
Companys chief financial officer or one or more individuals designated by
such person, and in any event, if a Stockholder Designee of such Stockholder
is then serving as a Director, with all information provided to members of the
Board; and (iii) such Stockholder shall be entitled to inspect all books and
records and facilities and properties of the Company at reasonable times and
intervals.

 



 

(b) Subject to the requirements of applicable Law (including the regulations
and rules of NASDAQ and any other or additional exchange on which the
securities of the Company are listed), each of the Stockholders shall, and
shall cause its officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel and
consultants (" _Representatives_ ") and its Stockholder Designees to, keep
confidential all information and documents of the Company and its Affiliates
obtained by it and its Stockholder Designees (the " _Company Information_ ")
unless the Company Information (i) is or becomes publicly available other than
as a result of a breach of this Section 3.5 by such Stockholder, including by
way of actions taken by its Representatives or its Stockholder Designees; (ii)
was within the possession of such Stockholder or its Stockholder Designees
prior to being furnished such information by or on behalf of the Company on a
non-confidential basis; _provided_ that the source of such information was not
known by such Stockholder, its Representatives or its Stockholder Designees to
be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or
fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to the Company Information; (iii) was available to
such Stockholder or its Stockholder Designees on a non-confidential basis from
a source other than the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or
their Representatives; _provided_ that such source was not known to such
Stockholder or its Stockholder Designees to be bound by a confidentiality
agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of
confidentiality to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
such Company Information; or (iv) was independently developed by or on behalf
of such Stockholder without violating any of the obligations under this
Section 3.5. Each of the Stockholders shall, and shall cause its Controlled
Affiliates, Representatives and Affiliated Directors to, comply with
applicable Law regarding insider trading in the Companys securities to the
extent any of them is in possession of Company Information.

 



 

(c) Each of the Stockholders hereby acknowledges that it is aware and will
advise its Representatives who are informed as to the matters which are the
subject of this Agreement, that the United States securities Laws prohibit any
Person who is in possession of material, non-public information concerning the
matters that are the subject of this Agreement from purchasing or selling
securities of the Company or from communicating such information to any other
Person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such
Person is likely to purchase or sell securities.

 



 

(d) For so long as the Voting Percentage of the DT Stockholder is 20% or
greater, the Company agrees that it will provide certain financial,
accounting, tax and other advisory services as reasonably requested by the DT
Stockholder on terms consistent with those

 



      
 

 



 

contained in the letter agreement, dated February 10, 2015, by and between DT
and the Company.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Director Consent Rights_. In addition to any other vote, consent
or approval required by the Companys Organizational Documents, this
Agreement, applicable Law or otherwise, during the term of this Agreement,
each of the Stockholders agrees not to, and shall cause its Affiliated
Directors then serving as Directors not to, support, enter into or vote in
favor of (a) any transaction in which the aggregate amount involved exceeds,
or may be expected to exceed, $120,000 between or involving both (i) the
Company and (ii) such Stockholder or an Affiliate of such Stockholder, unless
such transaction is approved unanimously by the Audit Committee of the Board
(an " _Approved Transaction_ "), or (b) any amendment or modification to,
extension or waiver of, or statement of work under, an Approved Transaction,
unless such amendment, modification, extension, waiver or statement of work
has been approved by a majority of the Audit Committee.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Acknowledgement of Voting Agreement and Proxy_. The Company
acknowledges that, pursuant to the DT-SoftBank Agreement, SoftBank has agreed
to, and to cause its Controlled Affiliates to, vote its and their Voting
Securities as directed by DT and has granted to DT a proxy over its and their
Voting Securities, in each case, in accordance with the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in the DT-SoftBank Agreement (such voting obligation
and proxy, the " _Proxy_ "). The Company agrees to take such actions as
reasonably requested by DT to facilitate the Proxy as contemplated by the DT-
SoftBank Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.8 _Top Up Procedures_. In the event that the Voting Percentage of
the SoftBank Stockholder would be reduced to less than 22.5% or the Voting
Percentage of the DT Stockholder would be reduced to less than 30% after the
date hereof as a direct result of a proposed issuance by the Company of any
equity or equity-linked securities or other Voting Securities, in a public or
private offering, regardless of the number of purchasers, in exchange for cash
(a " _Dilutive Issuance_ "), the Stockholder shall have the right to acquire
newly issued Voting Securities issued directly from the Company, either as
part of the Dilutive Issuance or otherwise as determined mutually by the
Company and the Stockholder, up to an amount that would cause the
Stockholders Voting Percentage to equal its Voting Percentage as of
immediately prior to the Dilutive Issuance (the " _Top Up Right_ ," and such
newly issued Voting Securities issued by the Company to the Stockholder
pursuant to such Top Up Right, the " _Top Up Shares_ "). The price per share
applicable to the Top Up Shares shall be equal to the price per share
applicable to the Dilutive Issuance that triggered the Top Up Right;
_provided_ that if the price per share applicable to the Dilutive Issuance is
not available or readily determinable, then the price per share applicable to
the Top Up Shares shall instead be equal to the average of the volume-weighted
average prices per share of the Common Stock on the national securities
exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed (as reported by Bloomberg
L.P. or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually
selected by DT and SoftBank) for the ten consecutive trading days immediately
preceding the date that the Dilutive Issuance is consummated or completed or
as otherwise determined mutually by the Company and the Stockholder. In the
event the Company proposes to issue Voting Securities that would constitute a
Dilutive Issuance, the Company shall provide a written notice of the Dilutive
Issuance to each Stockholder (the " _Dilutive Issuance Notice_ ") no later
than 10 Business Days prior to the Dilutive

 



      
 

 



 

Issuance, which Dilutive Issuance Notice shall set forth the proposed price
per share of the Voting Securities to be sold in the Dilutive Issuance and the
number of Voting Securities proposed to be sold in the Dilutive Issuance, and
all other material terms and conditions applicable to the Companys proposed
sale of Voting Securities in the Dilutive Issuance. In the event that a
Stockholder elects to exercise its Top Up Right, it shall deliver a written
notice (the " _Top Up Election_ ") to the Company no later than the 3rd
Business Day prior to the proposed date of the Dilutive Issuance as set forth
in the Dilutive Issuance Notice, which shall set forth the number of Voting
Securities the Stockholder intends to acquire from the Company pursuant to its
Top Up Right. Following the Companys receipt of a Top Up Election, the
Company shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are
necessary to issue the Top Up Shares to the Stockholder, including by
obtaining all consents and approvals required to be obtained from the Company,
its stockholders and any Governmental Entity and making all necessary
registrations and filings related thereto; and (ii) promptly consummate such
issuance to such Stockholder following the receipt of all such required
consents and approvals.

"), then such Acquiring Stockholder shall offer to acquire all of the then-
outstanding Common Stock at the same price and on the same terms and
conditions as the Proposed Acquisition (the " _Stockholder Purchase Offer_ ").
The Stockholder Purchase Offer may contemplate a merger or other
consolidation, a tender offer or any other transaction that permits the
acquisition of all of the then-outstanding Common Stock. The Acquiring
Stockholder shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, consummate, in

unless such Stockholder Purchase Offer is either (i) accepted and approved by
a majority of the Directors, which majority includes a majority of the Non-
Affiliated Directors, or (ii) accepted or approved by holders of a majority of
the Common Stock held by stockholders of the Company other than any of the

such Stockholder shall not effect such Proposed Sale other than in accordance
with Section 4.2(b).

 



 

(b) No Proposed Sale shall be consummated unless (i) such Proposed Sale
receives approval by the Board (including the Required Approval) or (ii) the
Proposed Acquiror shall contemporaneously make a binding offer to acquire all
of the then-outstanding Common Stock at the same price and on the same terms
and conditions as the Proposed Sale (the " _Acquiror Purchase Offer_ "). The

tender offer or any other transaction that permits the acquisition of all of
the then-outstanding Common Stock.

automatically effective registration statement if the Company is eligible for
such filing, or (b) any other appropriate form under the Securities Act for
the type of offering contemplated by a Stockholder, if the Company is not then
S-3 Eligible. Thereafter, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the written request of a Stockholder (each, a "

_Takedown Request_ "), file a prospectus supplement (a " _Takedown Prospectus
Supplement_ ") to such shelf registration statement filed under Rule 424
promulgated under the Securities Act with respect to resales of the
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Requesting Stockholders intended
method of distribution thereof, and to the extent such Takedown Prospectus
Supplement is not automatically effective upon filing, shall, subject to the
terms of this Article V, use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
prospectus supplement to be declared effective under the Securities Act
promptly after the filing thereof. Each Takedown Request shall specify the
Registrable Securities to be registered, their aggregate amount, and the
intended method or methods of distribution thereof. The Requesting Stockholder
agrees to provide the Company with such information in connection with a
Takedown Request as may be reasonably requested by the Company to ensure that

Securities Act.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Demand Registration_. At any time that the shelf registration

Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the

 



      
 

 



 

written request of a Requesting Stockholder for registration under the
Securities Act of all or part of the Registrable Securities (a " _Demand
Request_ "), file a registration statement with the SEC (a " _Demand
Registration Statement_ ") with respect to resales of the Registrable

filed on (a) Form S-3, if the Company is then S-3 Eligible, or (b) any other
appropriate form under the Securities Act for the type of offering
contemplated by the Requesting Stockholder, if the Company is not then S-3
Eligible. Each Demand Request shall specify the Registrable Securities to be
registered, their aggregate amount, and the intended method or methods of

shall be entitled to postpone and delay, for reasonable periods of time not in
excess of 60 days, but in no event more than twice in any 12-month period (a "
_Blackout Period_ "), the filing or effectiveness of any Takedown Prospectus
Supplement or Demand Registration Statement or the

 



      
 

 



 

offer or sale of any Registrable Securities thereunder if one or more
executive officers of the Company shall determine in good faith that any such
filing or the offering or sale of any Registrable Securities thereunder would
(i) impede, delay or otherwise interfere with any pending or contemplated
material acquisition, disposition, corporate reorganization or other similar
material transaction involving the Company, (ii) based upon advice from the
Companys investment banker or financial advisor, materially and adversely
impede, delay or otherwise interfere with any pending or contemplated

Stock, whether or not for sale for its own account, during a Blackout Period,
each of the Stockholders shall have the right to exercise its rights under
Section 5.4 with respect to such registration, subject to the limitations
contained in this Agreement on the exercise of such rights. Upon notice by the
Company to each of the Stockholders of any such determination, such
Stockholder shall, except as required by applicable Law, including any
disclosure obligations under Section 13 of the Exchange Act, keep the fact of
any such notice strictly confidential, and during any Blackout Period,

prospectus or prospectus supplement covering such Registrable Securities for
the duration of the Blackout Period set forth in such notice (or until such
Blackout Period shall be earlier terminated in writing by the Company) and, if
so directed by the Company, shall deliver to the Company any copies then in
its possession of any such prospectus or prospectus supplement.

 



 

(d) In connection with any offering pursuant to a Takedown Prospectus
Supplement or a Demand Registration Statement, the managing underwriter for
such offering shall be selected by the Requesting Stockholder (or, if there is
more than one Requesting Stockholder, by the Requesting Stockholders);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the managing underwriter must be a nationally
recognized investment banking firm.

(including any Requesting Stockholder), on a form and in a manner that would
permit registration of the Registrable Securities (other than in connection
with dividend reinvestment plans, rights offerings or a registration statement
on Form S-4 or S-8 or any similar successor form), the Company shall give each
of the Stockholders prompt written notice of its intent to do so not less than
15 Business Days prior to the contemplated filing date for such registration
statement. Upon the written request of any Stockholder (a " _Piggy-Back
Request_ "), given within five Business Days following the time that such
Stockholder was given any such written notice (which Piggy-Back Request shall
specify the number of Registrable Securities requested to be registered on
behalf of such Stockholder) (the " _Piggy-Back Securities_ "), the Company
shall include in such registration statement (a " _Piggy-Back Registration_
"), subject to the provisions of this Section 5.4 and, in the case of a
registration on behalf of any of the Companys stockholders, subject to the
rights of such stockholders, the number of Registrable Securities set forth in
such Piggy-Back Request.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.5 _Cutbacks_. In the event that (x) the Company proposes or is
required (other than pursuant to a Takedown Request or Demand Request) to
register Common Stock or Company debt securities in connection with an
underwritten offering, (y) one or both of the Stockholders has made a Piggy-
Back Request with respect to such offering, and (z) a nationally recognized
investment banking firm selected by the Company to act as managing underwriter
thereof reasonably and in good faith shall have advised the Company, the
Stockholder(s) or any other holder of Common Stock or Company debt securities
intending to offer Common Stock or Company debt securities in the offering, as
applicable (each, an " _Other Holder_ ") in writing that, in its opinion, the
inclusion in the registration statement of some or all of the Common Stock or
Company debt securities sought to be registered by the Company, the
Stockholder(s) or the Other Holder(s) would adversely affect the price or
success of the offering, the Company shall include in such registration
statement such number of shares of Common Stock or principal amount of Company
debt securities as the Company is advised can be sold in such offering without
such an effect (the " _Maximum Number_ ") as follows and in the following
order of priority:

 



 

(a) if such registration is by the Company for its own account, (i) _first_ ,
such number of shares of Common Stock or principal amount of Company debt
securities as the Company proposes to register for its own account, (ii)
_second_ , to the extent the number of shares of Common Stock or Company debt
securities to be included in the registration pursuant to clause (i) is less
than the Maximum Number, such number of Piggy-Back Securities as the
Requesting Stockholder(s) proposes to be included pursuant to a Piggy-Back
Request (with such number of Piggy-Back Securities allocated _pro rata_
between the Requesting Stockholder(s) in proportion to their respective Voting
Percentages), and (iii) _third_ , to the extent the number of shares of
Common Stock or Company debt securities to be included in the registration
pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) is less than the Maximum Number, such number
of shares of Common Stock or principal amount of Company debt securities as
all Other Holders request to be included for their own account (with such
number of shares or principal amount of debt allocated _pro rata_ between the
Other Holders in proportion to their respective Voting Percentages); or

 



 

(b) if such registration is pursuant to the demand registration rights of one
or more Other Holders, (i) _first_ , such number of shares of Common Stock or
principal amount of Company debt securities as such Other Holder(s) and the
Requesting Stockholder(s) propose to be included (with such number of shares
or principal amount allocated _pro rata_ among the Other Holder(s) and the
Requesting Stockholder(s) in proportion to their respective Voting
Percentages), and (ii) _second_ , to the extent the number of shares of
Common Stock or Company debt securities to be included in the registration
pursuant to clause (i) is less than the Maximum Number, such number of shares
of the Common Stock or principal amount of Company debt securities as the
Company requests to be included.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Termination of Registration Obligation_. The obligation of the
Company to register Registrable Securities pursuant to this Article V and
maintain the effectiveness of any shelf registration statement filed pursuant
to Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 shall terminate with respect to a Stockholder

Stockholders Voting Percentage is less than 5%, and (b) solely with respect
to Registrable Debt, on the first date on which such Stockholder no longer
Beneficially Owns any Registrable Debt.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 5.7 _Registration Procedures_. (a) In connection with each
registration statement prepared pursuant to this Article V pursuant to which
Registrable Securities will be offered and sold, and in accordance with the
intended method or methods of distribution of the Registrable Securities as
described in such registration statement, the Company shall:

 



 

(i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on an
appropriate registration form of the SEC and cause such registration statement
to become effective under the Securities Act promptly after the filing
thereof, which registration statement shall comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the applicable form and include all
financial statements required by such form to be filed therewith; _provided_
that before filing a registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or
supplements thereto, the Company shall furnish to one counsel selected by the
Requesting Stockholder(s) draft copies of all such documents proposed to be
filed at least five Business Days prior to such filing, which documents will
be subject to the reasonable review and comment of the Requesting
Stockholder(s) and its agents and Representatives and the underwriters, if
any, and the Company shall not file any amendment or supplement to a Takedown
Prospectus Supplement or Demand Registration Statement to which the Requesting
Stockholder(s) or the underwriters, if any, shall reasonably object;

 



 

(ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, furnish without charge to the Requesting Stockholder(s) and the
underwriters, if any, at least one conformed copy of the registration
statement and each post-effective amendment or supplement thereto (including
all schedules and exhibits but excluding all documents incorporated or deemed
incorporated therein by reference, unless requested in writing by the
Requesting Stockholder(s) or an underwriter, except to the extent such
exhibits and schedules are currently available via the SECs Electronic Data
Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system (" _EDGAR_ ")) and such number of
copies of the registration statement and each amendment or supplement thereto
(excluding exhibits and schedules) and the summary, preliminary, final,
amended or supplemented prospectuses included in such registration statement
as the Requesting Stockholder(s) or the underwriters, if any, may reasonably
request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the
Registrable Securities being sold by the Requesting Stockholder(s) (the
Company hereby consents to the use in accordance with the U.S. securities Laws
of such registration statement (or post-effective amendment thereto) and each
such prospectus (or preliminary prospectus or supplement thereto) by the
Requesting Stockholder(s) and the underwriters, if any, in connection with the
offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such registration
statement or prospectus);

 



 

(iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep such registration
statement effective until the date that is 45 days after the date such
registration statement is initially declared effective (or such shorter period
as shall terminate when all of the securities covered by the registration
statement have been disposed or withdrawn, or if such registration statement
relates to a firm commitment underwritten offering, such longer period as, in
the opinion of counsel for the underwriters for such offering, a prospectus is

 



      
 

 



 

required under the Securities Act to be delivered in connection with sales of
Registrable Securities by an underwriter or dealer (but not in excess of 90
days) (the " _Effective Period_ "), prepare and file with the SEC such
amendments, post-effective amendments and supplements to the registration
statement and the prospectus as may be necessary to maintain the effectiveness
of the registration for the Effective Period) and cause the prospectus (and
any amendments or supplements thereto) to be filed with the SEC;

 



 

(iv) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement under such other securities or "blue sky" laws of such
jurisdictions in the United States as are reasonably necessary, keep such
registrations or qualifications in effect for so long as the registration
statement remains in effect, and do any and all other acts and things which
may be reasonably necessary to enable the Requesting Stockholder(s) or any
underwriter to consummate the disposition of the Registrable Securities in
such jurisdictions; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
Company be required to (A) qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in
any jurisdiction where it would not, but for the requirements of this
subparagraph (iv), be required to be so qualified, (B) execute or file any
general consent to service of process under the Laws of any jurisdiction, (C)
take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits other
than those arising out of the offer and sale of the securities covered by the
registration statement, or (D) subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction
where it would not otherwise be obligated to do so, but for this subparagraph
(iv);

 



 

(v) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, cause all Registrable Shares covered by such registration
statement, if any, to be listed (after notice of issuance) on NASDAQ or on the
principal securities exchange or interdealer quotation system on which the
Common Stock is then listed or quoted;

 



 

(vi) use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify the Requesting
Stockholder(s) and the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, after
becoming aware thereof, (A) when the registration statement or any related
prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto has been filed, and, with
respect to the registration statement or any post-effective amendment, when
the same has become effective, (B) of any request by the SEC or any U.S. state
securities authority for amendments or supplements to the registration
statement or the related prospectus or for additional information, (C) of the
issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
registration statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose,
(D) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the
suspension of the qualification of the Registrable Securities for sale in any
jurisdiction or the initiation of any proceeding for such purpose, or (E)
within the Effective Period of the happening of any event or the existence of
any fact which makes any statement in the registration statement or any post-
effective amendment thereto, prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto, or any document incorporated therein by reference untrue in any
material respect or which requires the making of any changes in the
registration statement or post-effective amendment thereto or any prospectus
or amendment or supplement thereto so that they will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to

 



      
 

 



 

make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading;

 



 

(vii) during the Effective Period, use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, as promptly as practicable, the withdrawal of any order enjoining or
suspending the use or effectiveness of the registration statement or any post-
effective amendment thereto or the lifting of any suspension of the
qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any
jurisdiction at the earliest date reasonably practicable;

 



 

(viii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver promptly to the
Requesting Stockholder(s) and the managing underwriters, if any, copies of all
correspondence between the SEC and the Company, its counsel or auditors and
all memoranda relating to discussions with the SEC or its staff with respect
to the registration statement (except to the extent such correspondence is
currently available via EDGAR) and permit the Requesting Stockholder(s) to do
such investigation with respect to information contained in or omitted from
the registration statement as it deems reasonably necessary for the purpose of
conducting due diligence with respect to the Company; _provided_ that any such
investigation shall not interfere unreasonably with the Companys business;

 



 

(ix) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and registrar
for all Registrable Shares covered by such registration statement not later
than the effective date of such registration statement;

 



 

(x) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Requesting
Stockholder(s) and the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, to
facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing
the Registrable Securities to be sold under the registration statement in a
form eligible for deposit with the Depository Trust Corporation not bearing
any restrictive legends (other than as required by the Depository Trust
Corporation) and not subject to any stop transfer order with any transfer
agent, and cause such Registrable Securities to be issued in such
denominations and registered in such names as the managing underwriters, if
any, may request in writing or, if not an underwritten offering, in accordance
with the instructions of the Requesting Stockholder(s), in each case at least
two Business Days prior to any sale of Registrable Securities;

 



 

(xi) in the case of a firm commitment underwritten offering, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable,
enter into an underwriting agreement customary in form and substance (taking
into account the Companys prior underwriting agreements) for firm commitment
underwritten secondary offerings of the nature contemplated by the applicable
registration statement;

 



 

(xii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, obtain an opinion from the Companys counsel and a "cold comfort"
letter from the Companys independent public accountants (and, if necessary,
any other independent certified public accountants of any Subsidiary of the
Company or of any

 



      
 

 



 

business acquired by the Company for which financial statements and financial
data is, or is required to be, included in the registration statement) in
customary form and covering such matters as are customarily covered by such
opinions and "cold comfort" letters in connection with an offering of the
nature contemplated by the applicable registration statement;

 



 

(xiii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, provide to counsel to the Requesting Stockholder(s) and to the
managing underwriters, if any, and no later than the time of filing of any
document which is to be incorporated by reference into the registration
statement or prospectus (after the initial filing of such registration
statement), copies of any such document;

 



 

(xiv) cause its officers to fully cooperate with the marketing of the
Registrable Securities covered by the registration statement, including, at
the recommendation or request of the underwriters, making themselves available
to participate in "road-show," "one-on-one," and other customary marketing
activities in such locations (domestic and foreign) as recommended by the
underwriter(s);

 



 

(xv) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and any applicable national
securities exchange; and

 



 

(xvi) use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the requirements
of Rule 144(c)(1) with respect to public information about the Company.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Company would be required, pursuant to Section
5.7(a)(vi)(E), to notify the Requesting Stockholder(s) or the managing
underwriter or underwriters, if any, of the happening of any event specified
therein, the Company shall, subject to Section 5.3(c), as promptly as
practicable, prepare and furnish to the Requesting Stockholder(s) and to each
such underwriter a reasonable number of copies of a prospectus supplemented or
amended so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of Registrable
Securities that have been registered pursuant to this Agreement, such
prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The Requesting Stockholder(s) agrees that, upon receipt
of any notice from the Company pursuant to Section 5.7(a)(vi)(E), it shall,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to, cause any sales or placement
agent or agents for the Registrable Securities and the underwriters, if any,
to forthwith discontinue disposition of the Registrable Securities until such
Person shall have received copies of such amended or supplemented prospectus
and, if so directed by the Company, to destroy all copies, other than
permanent file copies, then in its possession of the prospectus (prior to such
amendment or supplement) covering such Registrable Securities as soon as
practicable after such Requesting Stockholders or Requesting Stockholders
receipt of such notice.

 



 

(c) (i) If requested by the managing underwriter for an underwritten offering
(primary or secondary) of any equity securities of the Company, the Requesting
Stockholder(s) agrees not to effect any Transfer of any Registrable Shares,
including any sale pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

Rule 144, and not to effect any Transfer of any other equity security of the
Company (in each case, other than as part of such underwritten public
offering) during the ten days prior to, and during the 90-day period (or such
longer period as the Requesting Stockholder(s) agrees with the underwriter of
such offering) beginning on, the consummation of any underwritten public
offering covered by a registration statement referred to in Section 5.4 if the
Requesting Stockholder(s) is permitted to include Registrable Shares
thereunder.

 



 

(ii) The Company hereby agrees that if it shall previously have received a
request pursuant to Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 for registration of Registrable
Securities in an underwritten offering, and if such previous registration
shall not have been withdrawn or abandoned, the Company, if requested by the
managing underwriter for such underwritten offering, shall not Transfer to a
third party or third parties any Common Stock, any other equity security of
the Company or any security convertible into or exchangeable for any equity
security of the Company until the earlier of (A) 90 days after the effective
date of such registration statement and (B) such time as all of the
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement have been
distributed; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company may Transfer Common Stock or such other securities (1) as part of such
underwritten offering, (2) pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-8 or
Form S-4 under the Securities Act or any successor or similar form, (3) as
part of a transaction under Rule 145 of the Securities Act, (4) in one or more
private transactions that would not interfere with the method of distribution
contemplated by such registration statement, or (5) if such Transfer was
publicly announced or agreed to in writing by the Company prior to the date of
the receipt of such request pursuant to Section 5.1.

 



 

(d) The Requesting Stockholder(s) shall furnish to the Company in writing such
information regarding the Requesting Stockholder(s) and its intended method of
distribution of the Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to
time reasonably request in writing in order for the Company to comply with its
obligations under all applicable securities and other Laws and to ensure that
the prospectus relating to such Registrable Securities conforms to the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. The Requesting Stockholder(s) shall promptly notify the Company of
any inaccuracy or change in information previously furnished by the Requesting
Stockholder(s) to the Company or of the occurrence of any event, in either
case as a result of which any prospectus relating to the Registrable
Securities contains or would contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, and promptly furnish to the Company any additional
information required to correct and update any previously furnished
information or required so that such prospectus shall not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(e) In the case of any underwritten offering of shares of Common Stock
registered under a Takedown Prospectus Supplement or a Demand Registration
Statement, or in the case of a registration under Section 5.4 if the Company
has entered into an underwriting agreement in connection therewith, all shares
of Common Stock to be included in such offering

 



      
 

 



 

or registration, as the case may be, shall be subject to the applicable
underwriting agreement and no Person may participate in such offering or
registration unless such Person agrees to sell such Persons securities on the
basis provided therein and completes and executes all questionnaires,
indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents (other than powers of
attorney) which must be executed in connection therewith, and provides such
other information to the Company or the underwriter as may be reasonably
requested to offer or register such Persons Common Stock.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Registration Expenses_. Each of the Stockholders shall bear all
agent fees and commissions, underwriting discounts and commissions and fees
and disbursements of its counsel and accountants in connection with any
registration and sale of any Registrable Securities by it, including pursuant
to Section 5.1 or Section 5.4. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
the Company shall bear all other fees and expenses in connection with any
registration statement for the registration of any Registrable Securities,
including all registration and filing fees, all printing costs and all fees
and expenses of counsel and accountants for the Company.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Indemnification; Contribution_. (a) The Company shall, and it
hereby agrees to, indemnify and hold harmless each of the Stockholders and its
Controlling Persons, if any, and each underwriter and its Controlling Persons,
if any, in any offering or sale of the Registrable Securities, including
pursuant to Section 5.1, Section 5.2 or Section 5.4, against any losses,
claims, damages or liabilities, actions or proceedings (whether commenced or
threatened) in respect thereof and expenses (including actual out-of-pocket
fees of counsel reasonably incurred) (collectively, " _Claims_ ") to which
each such indemnified party may become subject, insofar as such Claims
(including any amounts paid in settlement effected with the consent of the
Company as provided herein), or actions or proceedings in respect thereof,
arise out of, relate to, are in connection with, or are based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
registration statement, or any preliminary or final prospectus contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated
by reference therein, or arise out of, relate to, are in connection with, or
are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading, and the Company shall, and it hereby agrees to, reimburse
periodically any such Stockholder or underwriter for any actual out-of-pocket
legal or other actual out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by it in
connection with investigating or defending any such Claims; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be liable to any such Person in any
such case to the extent that any such Claims arise out of, relate to, are in
connection with, or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement,
or preliminary or final prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto, in
reliance upon information furnished to the Company by any Stockholder, any
underwriter or any Representative of such Stockholder, expressly for use
therein, or by such Stockholders failure to furnish the Company, upon
request, with the information with respect to such Stockholder, or any
underwriter or Representative of such Stockholder, or such Stockholders
intended method of distribution, that is the subject of the untrue statement
or omission.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each of the Stockholders shall, and hereby agrees to, (i) indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers, employees and Controlling
Persons, if any, and each underwriter, its partners, officers, directors,
employees and Controlling Persons, if any, in any offering or sale of
Registrable Securities by it against any Claims to which each such indemnified
party may become subject, insofar as such Claims (including any amounts paid
in settlement as provided herein), or actions or proceedings in respect
thereof, arise out of, relate to, are in connection with, or are based upon an
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
any registration statement, or any preliminary or final prospectus contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated
by reference therein, or arise out of, relate to, are in connection with, or
are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, in each case only to the extent that such untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by
such Stockholder expressly for use therein, and (ii) reimburse the Company for
any actual out-of-pocket legal or other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably
incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such
Claim.

 



 

(c) Each of the Stockholders and the Company agree that if, for any reason,
the indemnification provisions contemplated by Section 5.9(a) or Section
5.9(b) are unavailable to or are insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified
party in respect of any Claims referred to therein, then each indemnifying
party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party
as a result of such Claims in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified
party, on the other hand, with respect to the applicable offering of
securities. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified
party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such
indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such statement or omission. If, however, the allocation in the first sentence
of this Section 5.9(c) is not permitted by applicable Law, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only
such relative faults, but also the relative benefits of the indemnifying party
and the indemnified party, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 5.9(c) were to be
determined by _pro rata_ allocation or by any other method of allocation which
does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the
preceding sentences of this Section 5.9(c). The amount paid or payable by an
indemnified party as a result of the Claims referred to above shall be deemed
to include (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5.10) any actual
out-of-pocket legal or other out-of-pocket fees or expenses reasonably
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or
defending any such action, proceeding or claim. No Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Indemnification Procedures_. (a) If an indemnified party shall
desire to assert any claim for indemnification provided for under Section 5.9
in respect of,

 



      
 

 



 

arising out of or involving a Claim against such indemnified party, such
indemnified party shall notify the Company, the DT Stockholder or the SoftBank
Stockholder, as the case may be (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), in writing of
such Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to
the extent then ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the
final amount of such Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant
time constraints relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other
material details pertaining thereto (a " _Claim Notice_ ") promptly after
receipt by such indemnified party of written notice of the Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that failure to provide a Claim Notice shall not affect the
indemnification obligations provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure. The indemnified party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
promptly after the indemnified partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices
and documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified party
relating to the Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to provide any
such copies shall not affect the indemnification obligations provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 



 

(b) If a Claim is made against an indemnified party, the Indemnifying Party
will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses,
to assume the defense thereof with separate counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.
Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the indemnified party for legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the
defense thereof, unless the Claim involves potential conflicts of interest or
substantially different defenses for the indemnified party and the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense (except as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence), separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the actual out-
of-pocket fees and expenses of counsel reasonably incurred by the indemnified
party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the
defense thereof and as otherwise contemplated by the two immediately preceding
sentences. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Claim, the other
party shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Claim, and use of reasonable efforts to make
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not
the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Claim, the
indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, such Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may pay, settle or compromise a Claim
without the written consent of the indemnified party, so long as such
settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from
all liability in respect of such Claim, (ii) does not subject the indemnified
party to any injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, and (iii) does not
include a statement or admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or
on behalf of any indemnified party.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Transferee Registration Rights_. Any transferee who acquires at
least 5% of either the Registrable Shares or the Registrable Debt pursuant to
a Transfer that is

 



      
 

 



 

not registered under the Securities Act (each, a " _Registrable Securities
Transferee_ ") shall be entitled to enjoy the same registration and other
rights pursuant to this Article V as does the Stockholder that effected such
Transfer so long as the Registrable Shares or the Registrable Debt held by
such Registrable Securities Transferee may not be sold or disposed of pursuant
to Rule 144 without volume limitations at the time when such Registrable
Securities Transferee seeks to exercise its rights pursuant to this Agreement.
Any Registrable Securities Transferee shall enjoy such right pursuant to this
Section 5.11 if and to the extent the Company shall have received (x) written
notice from the Stockholder that effected such Transfer stating the name and
address of such Registrable Securities Transferee and identifying the amount
of Registrable Shares or Registrable Debt with respect to which such rights

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

 **NON** **-** **COMPETITION**

 



 

Section 6.1 _Non-Competition_. Each of the Stockholders agrees that (a) for
the period commencing at the Closing and expiring on the date that is six
months after the first date on which such Stockholders Voting Percentage is
less than 10%, neither such Stockholder nor any of its Controlled Affiliates
shall directly engage in the provision to retail mass market customers in the
Territory through a terrestrial facilities-based network of Commercial Mobile
Radio Services, Broadband Internet Access Service or acting as a Multichannel
Video Programming Distributor, in each case as such term is defined by the
Federal Communications Commission as of the date of the Business Combination
Agreement, including conventional mobile virtual network operator, but in each
case excluding the provision of (i) devices, software, apps, advertising and
"over-the-top" services on or through mobile, wireless or wired networks, (ii)
resale of network services ancillary to providing Internet of Things products
or services, including autonomous driving, accident prevention, monitoring and

with its terms and, in the case of the SoftBank Stockholder, at any time after
the Closing, manufacture, market or distribute any products or services under,
or use in any way, the trademark T-MOBILE in connection with any of the
activities described in clause (a) (subject to the exceptions therein), other
than by the Company and its Affiliates in accordance with the terms of the
Trademark License (each of (a) and (b), a " _Competing Business_ "). Each of
the Stockholders further agrees that, during the applicable period set forth
in clause (a) or (b), it will not acquire an interest in

 



      
 

 



 

(whether as a stockholder, member or partner, but in each case excluding any
such interest not exceeding 10% of the voting equity of a Person engaged in a
Competing Business or any such interests in a Person engaged in a Competing
Business if the aggregate purchase price for all of such interests is less
than $50,000,000), or manage, operate, or control, or act as or have the right
to appoint a director of, any Person engaged in a Competing Business (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries) (it being understood that no ownership
permitted by this sentence shall be considered to be a breach of any other
part of this Section 6.1). If the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares any term or provision of this Section 6.1 invalid or
unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to and
shall reform this Section 6.1 to reduce the time, geographic area and/or scope
of activity, to delete specific words or phrases, and/or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Reasonable Scope_. Each of the Stockholders acknowledges and
agrees that the agreements and covenants set forth in Section 6.1 are (a)
necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company, (b)
reasonable as to time, geographic area and scope of activity and do not impose
a greater restraint on the activities of such Stockholder than is reasonably
necessary to protect such legitimate business interests of the Company, and
(c) reasonable in light of the consideration and other value provided,
directly or indirectly, to such Stockholder by the Company pursuant to this
Agreement and the Business Combination Agreement. Each of the Stockholders
hereby waives any and all rights to contest the validity of the agreements and
covenants set forth in Section 6.1 on the ground of the reasonableness of the
length of their term or the breadth of their geographic area or scope of
activity.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Consequences of Certain Vision Fund Activities_. In the event
that any Vision Fund Person acquires (a) any interest (whether as a
stockholder, member or partner) in excess of 10% of the voting equity of any
of the Persons set forth on _Schedule 6.3_ or any successor thereto (whether
by merger, spin-off, split-off, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, acquisition or disposition of material assets or equity interests
or otherwise) (each, a " _Schedule 6.3 Person_ "), then the SoftBank
Stockholder shall (i) immediately give written notice thereof to the Company
and (ii) be deemed to automatically, irrevocably and immediately waive all
rights it may then or in the future have under Section 3.1, Section 3.2(c) and
Section 3.5(a). If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares any term or provision of this Section 6.3 invalid or unenforceable,
the parties hereto agree that the court making the determination of invalidity
or unenforceability shall have the power to and shall reform this Section 6.3
to reduce the time, geographic area and/or scope of activity, to delete
specific words or phrases, and/or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term
or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. The
SoftBank Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that the agreements and covenants
set forth in this Section 6.3 are (a) necessary to protect the legitimate
business interests of the Company, (b) reasonable as to time, geographic area
and scope of activity and do not impose a greater restraint on the activities
of the SoftBank Stockholder than is reasonably necessary to protect such
legitimate business interests of the Company, and (c) reasonable in light of
the consideration and other value provided, directly or indirectly, to the
SoftBank

 



       
 

 



 

Stockholder by the Company pursuant to this Agreement and the Business
Combination Agreement. The SoftBank Stockholder hereby waives any and all
rights to contest the validity of the agreements and covenants set forth in
this Section 6.3 on the ground of the reasonableness of the length of their
term or the breadth of their geographic area or scope of activity.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII**

 



 

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

Section 7.1 _Injunctive Relief_. The parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions
of this Agreement in any court referred to in Section 7.6(a), without proof of
actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing
or posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy), this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, or
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
for any such breach.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs,
legal representatives and permitted assigns. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, no party may directly or indirectly assign any of its rights
or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of the other parties; _provided_ that, without the written
consent of the other parties, (a) each Stockholder may assign any of its
rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to any Person that will
be a successor to or that will acquire Control of such Stockholder, whether by
merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, (b)
the Companys obligations will succeed to any Person that will be a successor
to the Company, whether by merger, consolidation or sale of all or
substantially all of its assets, and (c) each Stockholder may assign certain
of its rights in accordance with Section 5.11. Any purported direct or
indirect assignment in violation of this Section 7.2 shall be null and void
_ab initio_.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Amendments; Waiver_. No amendment, modification or discharge of
this Agreement, and no waiver hereunder, and no extension of time for the
performance of any of the obligations hereunder, shall be valid or binding
unless set forth in writing and duly executed by the parties. Any such waiver
shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter described
in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of any party granting
any waiver in any other respect or at any other time. The waiver by the
Company or any Stockholder of a breach of, or a default under, any of the
provisions hereof, or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall not
be construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature,
or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder.
Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the rights and remedies herein
provided are

 



      
 

 



 

cumulative and none is exclusive of any other, or of any rights or remedies
that any party may otherwise have at law or in equity.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Termination_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement
(including Section 5.6(b)), this Agreement shall terminate with respect to any
particular Stockholder at any time after which such Stockholders Voting
Percentage is less than 5%; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the obligations
of the Company under Section 3.2(a) shall terminate on the DT Specified
Actions Termination Date, and the obligations of the Company under Section
3.2(b) shall terminate on the SoftBank Specified Actions Termination Date; (b)
the indemnity and contribution provisions contained in Section 5.9 and Section
5.10 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any
termination of this Agreement; and (c) the provisions of Article VI and this
Article VII shall survive any termination of this Agreement or any provision
thereof. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to release any party from
any liability for any willful and material breach of this Agreement occurring
prior to any termination hereof or to impair the right of a party to compel
specific performance by the other party of its obligations under this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed
given if delivered personally or delivered by electronic mail (which is

or other request for leave from such court, and (iii) agrees that it will not
bring any such action in any court other than the Court of Chancery for the
State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, Delaware, or, if (and only if)
such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the federal court of
the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware, and appellate
courts thereof, or, if (and only if) each of such Court of Chancery for the
State of Delaware and such federal court finds it lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, any state court within the State of Delaware. Service of

set forth in Section 7.5 shall be effective service of process for any such
action. Each party hereto irrevocably designates C.T. Corporation as its agent
and attorney in fact for the acceptance of service of process and making an
appearance on its behalf in any such claim or proceeding and for the taking of
all such acts as may be necessary or appropriate in order to confer
jurisdiction over it before the aforementioned courts and each party hereto
stipulates that such consent and appointment is irrevocable and coupled with
in interest.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (iii) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION 7.6(b).

 



 

Section 7.7 _Interpretation_. The headings and table of contents contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The parties hereto have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, in
the event that an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted by the parties hereto and
no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Entire Agreement; No Other Representations_. This Agreement and
the Business Combination Agreement and, with respect to the DT Stockholder and
the SoftBank Stockholder, the DT-SoftBank Agreement constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior and contemporaneous agreements,

in Section 5.9, Section 5.10 and Section 5.11, this Agreement is not intended
to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder.

 



 

Section 7.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon a determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

 



 

Section 7.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties.

 



 

Section 7.12 _Affiliated Entities_. To the extent that any Controlled
Affiliate of DT is a DT Stockholder, DT shall cause such Controlled Affiliate

Owner, if reasonably practicable) execute a joinder in substantially in the
form of Annex I, and to execute any and all documents or instruments and take
such other actions required, or otherwise reasonably requested by DT, to
ensure that such Controlled Affiliate is subject to the obligations under this
Agreement applicable to the SoftBank Stockholder ( _provided_ that any failure

Date and (ii) such time as either the SoftBank Stockholder or the DT
Stockholder no longer Beneficially Owns at least 5% of the Voting Securities
outstanding as of the Effective Time (such earlier date, the " _ROFR Fall Away
Date_ "), neither Stockholder shall Transfer any of its Shares, whether such
Transfer occurs during or after the Lock-up Period, unless such Stockholder
shall have first complied with Section 4.2 of the Stockholders Agreement and
this Section 4 with respect to such Transfer of Shares; _provided_ that this
Section 4 shall not apply to (i) any Transfer described in Section 3(a)(i),
3(a)(iii) or 3(a)(iv), (ii) any Pledge of a Share or any Transfer in

Transfer in connection with a foreclosure of a Pledged Share shall be subject
to Section 5), or (iii) any Transfer pursuant to a Sale of the Company (as
defined in the Stockholders Agreement).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Transfer Notice_. Any Transfer of Shares subject to Section 4(a) (the "
_ROFR Shares_ ") by a Stockholder (the " _Transferring Stockholder_ ") to any
Person or Persons (the " _Proposed Transferee(s)_ ") shall not occur and shall
be null and void _ab initio_ unless, prior to the consummation of such
Transfer, the Transferring Stockholder shall, at least 20 Business Days prior
to the date that such Transfer is to be consummated, deliver a written notice
(the " _Offer Notice_ ") to the other Stockholder (the " _Offeree Stockholder_
") (i) setting forth (A) the number and type of Shares proposed to be
Transferred by the Transferring Stockholder, (B) whether the proposed Transfer
is an Open Market Transfer or not an Open Market Transfer, and (C) if the
proposed Transfer is not an Open Market Transfer, the name(s) and address(es)
of the Proposed Transferee(s), the per Share purchase price, the form of
consideration and the terms and conditions of payment offered by the Proposed
Transferee(s), and any other material terms and conditions of the proposed
Transfer (including a description of any non-cash consideration in sufficient
detail to permit a valuation thereof) (collectively, the " _Offer Terms_ "),
(ii) in the case of a proposed Transfer that is not an Open Market Transfer,
including a written certification that (A) the Offer Terms represent a _bona
fide_ proposal for the Transfer of the Shares to the Proposed Transferee(s) as
set forth in the Offer Notice and (B) the Transferring Stockholder believes in
good faith that a binding agreement for the Transfer could be obtainable on
the terms set forth in the Offer Notice and (iii) including, if the proposed
Transfer is an Open Market Transfer, a good-faith written estimate of the per-
share amount of any applicable underwriting discounts and fees, if any,
payable by the Proposed Transferee in the proposed Open Market Transfer, and
if the proposed Transfer is not an Open Market Transfer, a copy of any written
proposal, term sheet or letter of intent or other agreement relating to the
proposed Transfer.

 



 

(c) _Option of the Offeree Stockholder_. The Offer Notice shall constitute,
for a period of 20 Business Days after the delivery of the Offer Notice, a
binding, irrevocable and exclusive offer to sell to the Offeree Stockholder
(or any Controlled Affiliate of the Offeree Stockholder designated by the
Offeree Stockholder or as part of a "group" including the Offeree Stockholder
as contemplated by Section 13d-5(b) of the Exchange Act) (the " _Designated
Transferee_ ") any or all of the ROFR Shares (i) in the case of a proposed
Transfer that is not an Open Market Transfer, on the Offer Terms (at the price
per Share set forth therein); _provided_ that if the Offer Terms provide for
payment of any non-cash consideration, the Offeree Stockholder may elect to
pay the purchase price in respect of such non-cash consideration in cash in an
amount that is equal to the fair market value of such non-cash consideration
described in the Offer Terms, as determined in good faith and mutually agreed
by the Transferring Stockholder and the Offeree Stockholder (provided that, if
the Transferring Stockholder and the Offeree Stockholder shall be unable to so
mutually agree within 10 Business Days of the delivery of the Offer Notice,
then either party may commence the valuation process described in Section 4(e)
and the all periods set forth in this _Section 4(c)_ shall be tolled for, and
such periods (or the remaining portion thereof) shall recommence only upon a
final and binding determination of fair market value pursuant to, such
valuation process); and (ii) in the case of a proposed Transfer that is an
Open Market Transfer, at the Open Market Transfer Price; _provided_ that, in
each of clauses (i) and (ii), during such 20-Business-Day period, the
Transferring Stockholder may not effect the proposed Transfer to the Proposed
Transferee(s) or pursuant to any Open Market Transfer, as applicable (unless
prior to the expiration thereof, the Offeree Stockholder provides written
notice to the Transferring Stockholder that it is not electing to purchase the
ROFR Shares). To accept such offer, an Offeree Stockholder shall deliver
written notice (the " _Acceptance Notice_ ") to the Transferring Stockholder
on or prior to the end of such 20-Business-

 



      
 

 



 

Day period setting forth (A) its binding acceptance of such offer, (B) the
identity of the Designated Transferee, (C) the planned date for purchase of
the ROFR Shares, which shall be a reasonable date within 120 days from the
date of the Purchase Offer (the " _Planned Purchase Date_ ") and (D) the
number of ROFR Shares to be purchased, whereupon the Transferring Stockholder
will be obligated to sell, and the Offeree Stockholder will be obligated to
purchase, the ROFR Shares in accordance with the Offer Terms or Open Market
Transfer Price, as applicable, or such other terms and conditions as may be
agreed between the Transferring Stockholder and the Offeree Stockholder. The
closing of such purchase and sale shall occur on the Planned Purchase Date or
at such time and place as the Transferring Stockholder and the Offeree
Stockholder may agree, pursuant to an agreement containing reasonable and
customary representations and warranties and other terms and conditions.

 



 

(d) _Ability to Sell of the Transferring Stockholder_. If (i) the Offeree
Stockholder does not deliver an Acceptance Notice on or prior to the end of
the 20-Business-Day period set forth in Section 4(c), (ii) the Offeree
Stockholder or the Designated Transferee, as the case may be, has not paid the
full Transfer price for the ROFR Shares on such terms and conditions as may be
agreed between the Transferring Stockholder and the Offeree Stockholder or, in
the absence of such agreement, in accordance with the Offer Terms or the Open
Market Transfer Price, as applicable, or (iii) the Acceptance Notice is not
for all the ROFR Shares, the Transferring Stockholder may, during the 120-day
period immediately following the earlier of the end of such 20-Business-Day
period and the delivery of the Acceptance Notice, Transfer the ROFR Shares (or
the remaining ROFR Shares, in the event the Acceptance Notice is not for all
the ROFR Shares) (A) if the proposed Transfer is an Open Market Transfer,
pursuant to an Open Market Transfer, and (B) if the proposed Transfer is not
an Open Market Transfer, to the Proposed Transferee(s) for no less than the
per Share purchase price and the form of consideration, and on substantially
similar terms and conditions of payment set forth in the Offer Terms, and
otherwise on terms and conditions no more favorable to the Proposed
Transferee(s) than the Offer Terms; _provided_ that, if the Transferring
Stockholder does not consummate the Transfer of the ROFR Shares in accordance
with the foregoing within such 120-day period, any attempt to Transfer such
ROFR Shares shall again be subject to the provisions of this Section 4.

 



 

(e) _Valuation Process for Non-Cash Consideration_. If any Offer Terms provide
for payment of any non-cash consideration, then the Transferring Stockholder
and the Offeree Stockholder shall negotiate in good faith to determine the
fair market value of such non-cash consideration. If they are unable to agree
on such fair market value within 10 Business Days of the delivery of the Offer
Notice, then either the Transferring Stockholder or the Offeree Stockholder
may commence the valuation process described in this _Section 4(e)_ by
providing written notice to the other party (such notice, a " _Valuation
Process Notice_ "). In the event a Valuation Process Notice is delivered, then
within 10 Business Days of the delivery of the Valuation Process Notice, each
of the Transferring Stockholder and the Offeree Stockholder shall appoint an
internationally recognized investment banking firm (an " _Appointed Bank_ ").
Each of the Transferring Stockholder and the Offeree Stockholder shall
instruct its Appointed Bank to determine, by no later than 20 Business Days
after being appointed, its best estimate of the fair market value of the non-
cash consideration, based on the customary methodologies that such Appointed
Bank in its professional experience deem relevant to such a determination. On
the 45th Business Day following delivery of the Valuation Process Notice or
such earlier date as mutually agreed between the Transferring Stockholder and
the Offeree Stockholder, each

 



      
 

 



 

Appointed Bank shall present to the other party and its Appointed Bank its
determination of the fair market value of such non-cash consideration. In the
event the fair market values determined by the two Appointed Banks are within
10% of one another (determined by reference to the higher of the two), the
fair market value shall be the average of those two estimates and such
determination of the fair market value of the non-cash consideration shall be
final and binding on the Transferring Stockholder and the Offeree Stockholder.
In the event the fair market values determined by the two Appointed Banks are
not within 10% of one another (determined by reference to the higher of the
two), the Appointed Banks shall mutually select a third internationally
recognized investment banking firm (the " _Independent Bank_ ") to determine,
by no later than 20 Business Days after being appointed, its best estimate of
the fair market value of the non-cash consideration, based on the customary
methodologies that such Independent Bank in its professional experience deem
relevant to such a determination. The fair market value of the non-cash
consideration shall then be determined by the Independent Bank, and such
resulting determination shall be final and binding on the Transferring
Stockholder and the Offeree Stockholder.

 



 

5. _Right of First Refusal upon Foreclosure of Pledged Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Applicability_. Until the ROFR Fall Away Date, neither Stockholder shall
permit any Person to Transfer Pledged Shares in connection with any
foreclosure without first complying with the procedures set forth in this
Section 5, and neither Stockholder shall enter into any agreement or
arrangement relating to a Pledge that is inconsistent with or would have the
effect of circumventing the process and requirements set forth in this Section
5.

 



 

(b) _Pledge ROFR Notice_. In the event that a financial institution, brokerage
firm or other Person that is the creditor in respect of any Obligation (such
Person, including any agent, trustee or other Person acting in a similar
capacity on behalf of such creditor, being a " _Pledge Counterparty_ ")
delivers a notice of event of default or a similar event or consequence
pursuant to any the agreement or arrangement relating to an Obligation secured
by a Pledge of Shares, it shall concurrently deliver a written notice (the "
_Pledge ROFR Notice_ ") to the other Stockholder (the " _Pledge ROFR Offeree
Stockholder_ "), which notice shall include a copy of the notice delivered to
the first Stockholder and shall set forth (i) the number of Pledged Shares
securing the Obligation that is in default or subject to a similar event or
consequence (the " _Pledge ROFR Shares_ "), (ii) the number of Pledge ROFR
Shares that are Pledged Required Consolidation Shares or Pledged Excess
Shares, (iii) the VWAP for the ten consecutive trading days immediately
preceding the date of the Pledge ROFR Notice (the " _Pledge ROFR Price_ "),
(iv) the cure period applicable to such default, event or consequence and the
earliest date and time following such cure period on which the Pledge
Counterparty may foreclose on the Pledge ROFR Shares (together, the " _Pledge
ROFR Foreclosure Period_ "), which Pledge ROFR Foreclosure Period shall be no
less than 2 Business Days, subject to notice, cure and information rights set
forth in the agreements for such Pledged Shares, and (v) all other material
terms and conditions related to the right of first refusal described in this
Section 5.

 



 

(c) _Option of the Pledge ROFR Offeree Stockholder_. The Pledge ROFR Notice
shall constitute, during the Pledge ROFR Foreclosure Period, a binding,
irrevocable and exclusive offer to sell to the Pledge ROFR Offeree Stockholder
(or any Controlled Affiliate of the Pledge ROFR Offeree Stockholder designated
by the Pledge ROFR Offeree Stockholder or

 



      
 

 



 

as part of a "group" including the Pledge ROFR Offeree Stockholder as
contemplated by Section 13d-5(b) of the Exchange Act) (the " _Designated
Pledge ROFR Transferee_ ") any or all of the Pledge ROFR Shares on the terms
and at the Pledge ROFR Price set forth in the Pledge ROFR Notice; _provided_
that during the Pledge ROFR Foreclosure Period, the Pledge Counterparty may
not effect a foreclosure sale or other Transfer of the Pledge ROFR Shares
unless prior to the expiration thereof, the Pledge ROFR Offeree Stockholder
provides written notice to the Pledge Counterparty that it has elected not to
purchase the Pledge ROFR Shares. The Pledge ROFR Offeree Stockholder may elect
to purchase any or all of the Pledge ROFR Shares by delivering a written
notice (the " _Pledge ROFR Acceptance Notice_ ") to both the Stockholder that
has Pledged such Shares and the Pledge Counterparty on or prior to the end of
the Pledge ROFR Foreclosure Period setting forth (i) its irrevocable
acceptance of such offer, (ii) the identity of the Designated Pledge ROFR
Transferee, (iii) its commitment to purchase the Pledge ROFR Shares on a date
that is on or prior to the last day of the Pledge ROFR Foreclosure Period (the
" _Pledge ROFR Purchase Date_ "), and (iv) the number of Pledge ROFR Shares to
be purchased, whereupon both the Stockholder that has Pledged such Shares and
the Pledge Counterparty will be obligated to sell, and the Pledge ROFR Offeree
Stockholder will be obligated to purchase, such number of Pledge ROFR Shares
in accordance with the terms set forth in the Pledge ROFR Notice or such other
terms and conditions as may be agreed between the Pledge ROFR Offeree
Stockholder and the Pledge Counterparty. The closing of such purchase and sale
shall occur on the Pledge ROFR Purchase Date or at such time and place as the
Pledge ROFR Offeree Stockholder and the Pledge Counterparty may agree,
pursuant to an agreement containing reasonable and customary representations
and warranties and other terms and conditions.

Agreement that occurred prior to such termination.

 



 

10. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

(a) _Injunctive Relief_. The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any court referred to in Section 10(e), without proof of actual
damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection

 



      
 

 



 

with any such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert
that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
law or inequitable for any reason, or to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach.

 



 

(b) _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. No party may directly or indirectly
assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of the other party; _provided_
that, without the written consent of the other parties, each Stockholder may
assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to any
Person that will be a successor to or that will acquire Control of such

all of its assets. Any purported direct or indirect assignment in violation of
this Section 10(b) shall be null and void _ab initio_.

 



 

(c) _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment, modification or discharge of this
Agreement, and no waiver hereunder, and no extension of time for the
performance of any of the obligations hereunder, shall be valid or binding
unless set forth in writing and duly executed by the parties. Any such waiver
shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter described
in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of any party granting
any waiver in any other respect or at any other time. The waiver by any
Stockholder of a breach of, or a default under, any of the provisions hereof,
or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall not be construed as a
waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of
any of such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. Except as expressly
provided in this Agreement, the rights and remedies herein provided are
cumulative and none is exclusive of any other, or of any rights or remedies
that any party may otherwise have at law or in equity.

 **Amendment No. 1 to License Agreement**

 



 

Between

 



 

Deutsche Telekom AG

 

Friedrich-Ebert-Allee 140, 53113 Bonn, Germany

 

(hereinafter referred to as " **DT** ")

 



 

and

 



 

T-Mobile US, Inc.

 

12920 SE 38th Street, Bellevue, WA 98006, USA

 

(hereinafter referred to as " **Licensee** ")

 



 

This Amendment No. 1 to the License Agreement (the " **Amendment** "), dated
[*], 201[*], (the " **Amendment Effective Date** ") is hereby made and entered
into by and between DT and Licensee (collectively, the " **Parties** ").

 



 

WHEREAS, Licensee has entered into a Business Combination Agreement dated
April 29, 2018, pursuant to which Licensee, Sprint Corporation (" **Sprint**
"), and the other parties to the Business Combination Agreement have agreed
that Licensee and Sprint shall combine in one or more transactions in
accordance with the Business Combination Agreement (the " **Proposed
Transaction** ").

 



 

WHEREAS, DT and Licensee are Parties to that certain License Agreement, dated
as of April 30, 2013 (the " **Agreement** ").

 



 

WHEREAS, the Agreement requires in Section 7.4 that the Parties meet after
five years to attempt to agree on a New License Fee to be applicable as of
January 1, 2019.

 



 

WHEREAS, the Parties have met and agreed on a New License Fee that will be the
License Fee for the ten-year period commencing January 1, 2019; provided,
however, that the agreed New Licensee Fee will terminate and be of no further
effect if the Proposed Transaction fails to close according to the terms of
the Business Combination Agreement.

 



 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of covenants and agreements contained herein,
and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, DT and Licensee agree as follows:

 



 

1. **Definitions**. Capitalized terms that are used in this Amendment without separate definition shall have the meanings specified in the Agreement.

 



 

2. **Amendment to Section 1.11.** Section 1.11 of the Agreement is deleted in its entirety and replaced by the following:

 



 

1.11 "Licensed Products" shall mean all products (including their packaging)
that are sold, leased, provided, used for or distributed (including through
retailers, dealers, agents,

      
 

 



 

data carriers and online) in connection with the Licensed Services, including
(A) cellphones, smartphones, tablet PCs, personal digital assistants, portable
media players, and any other type of broadband, wireless, information, or
wireline devices, (B) dongles, set-top boxes, TVs, multichannel video
programming distribution ("MVPD") devices and applications, and any other type
of video, or video delivery devices, (C) SIM cards for the aforementioned
devices, (D) accessories for the aforementioned devices and (E) ancillary
products for the aforementioned devices.

 



 

3. **Amendment to Section 1.12.** Section 1.12 of the Agreement is deleted in its entirety and replaced by the following:

 



 

1.12 "Licensed Services" shall mean the marketing, selling and providing of
(A) wireless communication services, including without limitation,
telecommunication, broadband and information services (including voice and
data services), (B) wireline telecommunications, broadband and information
services (including voice and data services), (C) video services (including
MVPD), and all similar services and services ancillary thereto.

 



 

4. **Amendment to Section 6.1.** Section 6.1 of the Agreement is deleted in its entirety and replaced by the following:

 



 

DT represents and warrants that it has the right and authority to grant the
license granted in Section 2, excluding the Licensed Products 1.11 (B) and
Licensed Services 1.12 (B) and (C); provided, however, DT will undertake a
review of its right and authority to grant a license under Section 2 with
respect to the foregoing listed exclusions with respect to the Licensed
Products and Licensed Services and within 90 days of the Amendment Effective
Date make such representations and warranties under Section 2 to the extent
DT, acting reasonably, has such right and authority. With respect to the
Trademarks listed in Annex 1.1 and Domains, but excluding the Licensed
Products 1.11 (B) and Licensed Services 1.12 (B) and (C), DT represents and
warrants that Licensees use of such Trademarks and Domains do not and will
not infringe, violate or misappropriate and third party intellectual property
rights under the condition that such use is in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Licensee permits DT to take over the Licensees defense
of such claim as provided in Section 13.1; provided, however, DT will
undertake a review of Licensees use of the Trademarks and Domains for the
foregoing listed excluded Licensed Products and Licensed Services and within
90 days of the Amendment Effective Date make the forgoing representations and
warranties under Section 2 to the Extent DT can, acting reasonably, make such
representations and warranties.

 



 

5. **Amendment to Section 7**. A new Section 7.6 is hereby added to the Agreement as follows:

 



 

7.6 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the New License Fee
shall be the existing License Fee, but shall be subject to a cap of U.S.
$80,000,000.00 per calendar year (the " **Cap** ") from January 1, 2019,
through December 31, 2028. The New License Fee for the five-year period from
January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2023, and for the five-year period from
January 1, 2024, through

      
 

 



 

December 31, 2028, will be determined in accordance with the Agreement without
any application of the benchmark, accountant or arbitration processes or
proceedings described in Sections 7.4 and 7.5. The New License Fee for the
five-year period from January 1, 2029, through December 31, 2033, and
thereafter for subsequent five-year renewal terms, will be as negotiated by
the Parties or, if they fail to reach agreement on the New License Fee for any
such renewal terms, by application of the accountant or arbitration
proceedings described in Sections 7.4 and 7.5 of the Agreement without
application of the Cap. For the avoidance of doubt, the Cap shall apply to any
New License Fee in accordance with the Agreement for the two five-year renewal
terms from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2028.

 



 

6. **Recitals.** The Recitals set forth above are material to this Amendment and are a part hereof.

 



 

7. **Effectiveness**. This Amendment shall become effective as of the Amendment Effective Date. The License Fee for calendar year 2018 shall be determined in accordance with the Agreement without any application of Sections 7.4 and 7.5. If the Business Combination Agreement is terminated, the new Section 7.6 provided above will terminate and be of no force or effect as of the date of such termination, and the New License Fee shall be determined as provided in Section 7.4 and applied retroactively to January 1, 2019. In such event, Licensee shall pay any difference between what it has paid through such date and what it owes due to the retroactive application of the New License Fee within 60 days after receipt of a DT issued proper invoice complying with the applicable tax laws. Except as may be amended hereby, the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as written. The Agreement, as amended and supplemented by this Amendment, shall be read, taken and construed as one and the same instrument. To the extent that any term of the Agreement (prior to its amendment hereby) conflicts with any term of this Amendment as set forth herein after the Amendment Effective Date, the terms of this Amendment shall control to the extent of such conflict.

 



 

8. **Counterparts**. This Amendment may be executed in counterparts, each of which, when executed, shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together will be deemed to be one and the same instrument.

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Amendment effective
as of the Amendment Effective Date.
