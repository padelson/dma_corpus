 (i) by Seller Parent or Buyer Ultimate Parent, if the approval of the Share Issuance by the shareholders of Buyer Ultimate Parent shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the Buyer Ultimate Parent Requisite Vote at the Buyer Ultimate Parent Special Meeting.

 (b) The failure to provide notice in accordance with the required timing, if any, set forth herein shall affect the rights of the party providing such notice only to the extent that such delay actually prejudices the rights of the party receiving such notice. 

  

 Section 9.3 _Amendment; Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by each of the Parties hereto, or in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law. 

  

 Section 9.4 _No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement and their respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns. No Party to this Agreement may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, by operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto, except as provided in Section 9.5 and except that any Buyer Party may assign any or all of its rights under this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates (but no such assignment shall relieve such Buyer Party of any of its obligations hereunder and such Affiliate shall become bound by all of the terms of this Agreement) and any Seller Party may assign any and all of its rights under this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates (but no such assignment shall relieve such Seller Party of any of its obligations hereunder and such Affiliate shall become bound by all of the terms of this Agreement). Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person, other than the Parties and their respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits, the Annexes and the disclosure schedules to this Agreement) and the Ancillary Agreements contain the entire agreements between the Parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters, except in the case of fraud and except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. 

  

 Section 9.6 _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Any obligation of any Party to any other Party under this Agreement, which obligation (i) is performed, satisfied or fulfilled completely by an Affiliate of such Party, shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such 

   ##### 

  

 

Party and (ii) is to be performed, satisfied or fulfilled by an Affiliate of a
Party hereunder but is not so fulfilled shall be deemed to have not been
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such Party. 

   

 Section 9.7 _Public Disclosure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no press release or similar public announcement or communication relating to this Agreement (except for press releases or public announcements or communications made in relation to the Form S-4, the Proxy Statement, the Circular and the Hong Kong announcements, which shall be governed by Sections 6.8 and 6.9) shall be made or caused to be made without the prior written consent of all Parties to this Agreement, other than any such press release or similar public announcement or communication that must be made or caused to be made by a Party to this Agreement to comply with the requirements of any applicable Law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange upon which its securities are listed (it being understood and agreed that in the event that any such press release or similar public announcement or communication must be made or caused to be made by a Party to this Agreement, such Party shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, provide the other Parties to this Agreement with advance written notice of the details of, and an opportunity to comment on, such press release or similar public announcement or communication). 

  

 Section 9.8 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder (including the costs and expenses related to obtaining the Buyers Required Approvals, the Transferred Entities Required Approvals and the Sellers Required Approvals) shall be borne by the Party incurring such costs and expenses, provided, however, that all costs and expenses of the Seller Parties and its Affiliates (including all of the costs and expenses relating to the Credit Agreement, the Laminate Sale and the Transfer Taxes to be borne by the Seller Parties pursuant to Section 6.5(b)) shall be borne by Seller Parent for an amount of up to HK$40,000,000, with the remaining amount of such costs and expenses borne by the Transferred Entities. 

  

 Section 9.9 _Schedules_. The disclosure of any matter in one section or subsection of the Sellers Disclosure Schedules or the Buyers Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to be a disclosure for all sections or subsections of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is relevant to such other sections and subsections, but shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by the Seller Parties or the Buyer Parties, as the case may be, or to otherwise imply that any such matter is material or, in the case of the Seller Parties, would have a Material Adverse Effect for the purposes of this Agreement or, in the case of the Buyer Parties, would have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect for the purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.10 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. 

   

 (a) THIS AGREEMENT, THE LEGAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND THE ADJUDICATION AND THE ENFORCEMENT HEREOF AND THEREOF, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND INTERPRETED AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL, SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED WHOLLY WITHIN THAT JURISDICTION, WITHOUT 

   ##### 

  

   

GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW RULES AND PRINCIPLES THEREOF. Each party
acknowledges that it could be impossible to determine the amount of damages
that would result from any breach of many of the provisions of this Agreement
and that the remedy at law for any breach, or threatened breach, of any of
such provisions would likely be inadequate and, accordingly, agrees that each
other party shall, in addition to any other rights or remedies which it may
have, be entitled to seek such provisional or temporary injunctive relief
as may be available from any Delaware Court (as defined below) to compel
specific performance of, or restrain any party from violating, any of such
provisions. In connection with any request for temporary or permanent
injunctive relief permitted under this Agreement, each party hereby waives
the claim or defense that a remedy at law alone is adequate and agrees, to
the maximum extent permitted by Law, to have each provision of this
Agreement specifically enforced against it, without the necessity of posting
bond or other security against it, and consents to the entry of temporary or
permanent equitable and injunctive relief against it enjoining or restraining
any breach or threatened breach of such provisions of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Each of the Parties hereto, by its execution hereof, hereby: 

   

 (i) irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any federal court of the United States located in the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Courts_ "), for the purpose of any and all actions, suits or proceedings arising in whole or in part out of, related to, based upon or in connection with this Agreement or the subject matter hereof; 

   

 (ii) waives to the extent not prohibited by Law, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that any such action brought in one of the above-named courts should be dismissed on grounds of _forum non conveniens_ , should be transferred to any court other than one of the above-named courts, or should be stayed by reason of the pendency of some other proceeding in any other court other than the Delaware Courts, or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by Delaware Courts, and 

   

 (iii) agrees not to commence any such action other than before one of the Delaware Courts nor to make any motion or take any other action seeking or intending to cause the transfer or removal of any such action to any court other than the Delaware Courts whether on the grounds of _forum non conveniens_ or otherwise. 

   

 (c) Each of the Seller Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally designate, appoint, and empower The Corporation Trust Company, Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, as their respective designee, appointee and agent to receive, accept and acknowledge for and on their behalf service of any and all legal process, summons, notices and documents that may be served in any action, suit or proceeding brought against such Seller Party in any such United States federal or state court with respect to their obligations, liabilities or any other matter arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and that may be made on such designee, appointee and agent in 

   ##### 

  

   

accordance with legal procedures prescribed for such courts. If for any
reason such designee, appointee and agent hereunder shall cease to
be available to act as such, the Seller Parties agree to designate a new
designee, appointee and agent in the State of Delaware on the terms and for
the purposes of this Section 9.10(c) reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer
Ultimate Parent. Each Seller Party further hereby irrevocably consents and
agrees to the service of any and all legal process, summons, notices and
documents in any such action, suit or proceeding against the Seller Party by
serving a copy thereof upon the relevant agent for service of process
referred to in this Section 9.10(c) (whether or not the appointment of such
agent shall for any reason prove to be ineffective or such agent shall accept
or acknowledge such service) or by sending copies thereof by a recognized
next day courier service to such Seller Party at its address specified in
or designated pursuant to this Agreement. The Seller Parties agree that the
failure of any such designee, appointee and agent to give any notice of such
service to them shall not impair or affect in any way the validity of such
service or any judgment rendered in any action or proceeding based thereon. 

   

 (d) EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION UNDER THIS SECTION 9.10. THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT ANY OR ALL OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY AND THAT ANY COURT ACTION OR PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM THAT IS PERMITTED UNDER THIS SECTION 9.10 SHALL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A DELAWARE COURT BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY. 

  

 Section 9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, including via facsimile, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and the same Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.12 _Headings_. The heading references in this Agreement and the table of contents of this Agreement are for convenience purposes only, and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.13 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. 

  

 Section 9.14 _Joint Negotiation_. The parties to this Agreement have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no 

   ##### 

  

    

presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.15 _No Set-Off_. No Party shall be permitted to set-off or deduct any amount from any payment or other amount due to any other Party hereunder.

commissions, which shall be paid by the Buyer Ultimate Parent (with respect
to shares being sold by the Buyer Ultimate Parent) and by selling
shareholders (with respect to shares being sold by them); and (ii) fees for
legal counsel for the selling holders (which will be paid by the selling
holders in proportion to the proceeds received by Principal Shareholders and
all other selling holders).  
      
    |   | Buyer Ultimate Parent shall provide customary covenants for
assistance to the offerings of the Registrable Securities (including
