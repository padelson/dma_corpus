that it could be impossible to determine the amount of damages that would result from any
breach of many of the provisions of this Agreement and that the remedy at law for any
breach, or threatened breach, of any of such provisions would likely be inadequate and,
accordingly, agrees that each other party shall, in addition to any other rights or remedies
which it may have, be entitled to seek such provisional or temporary injunctive relief as
may be available from any Delaware Court (as defined below) to compel specific performance
of, or restrain any party from violating, any of such provisions. In connection with any
request for temporary or permanent injunctive relief permitted under this Agreement, each
party hereby waives the claim or defense that a remedy at law alone is adequate and agrees,
to the maximum extent permitted by Law, to have each provision of this Agreement
specifically enforced against it, without the necessity of posting bond or other security
against it, and consents to the entry of temporary or permanent equitable and injunctive
relief against it enjoining or restraining any breach or threatened breach of such
provisions of this Agreement.
