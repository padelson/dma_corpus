affidavit, including an agreement to indemnify Buyer, signed exactly as the
name or names of the registered holder or holders appeared on the books of
MLP immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with a customary bond
and such other documents as Buyer may reasonably require in connection
therewith. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on
the records of MLP or its transfer agent of Certificates; and if such
Certificates are presented to MLP or its transfer agent for transfer, they
shall be canceled against delivery of the certificate or certificates for
Buyer Common Units and any Fractional Unit Payment as hereinabove provided.
If any certificate for such Buyer Common Units is to be issued to a person
other than the registered holder of a Certificate surrendered for exchange,

shall be properly endorsed, with signature guaranteed, or otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to
Buyer or the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the issuance of certificates for such Buyer Common Units in a name other than
that of the registered holder of the Certificate(s) surrendered, or establish
to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer or the Exchange Agent that such tax
has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.1(f), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Closing Date to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Buyer Common Units and Fractional Unit Payment, if any, as contemplated by
this Section 2.1. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any Fractional
Unit Payment.

  

### (g) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Certificates. _No

distributions payable with respect to such whole Buyer Common Units with a

### (h) _No Further Ownership Rights in MLP Common Units. _All Buyer Common
Units issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance
with the terms of this Section 2.1 (including any Fractional Unit Payment)
shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the MLP Common Units heretofore represented by such
Certificates (including all rights to common units arrearages), subject,
however, to Buyers obligation, with respect to MLP Common Units outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, to pay any distributions with a
record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made
by MLP on such MLP Common Units in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time and that remain unpaid at the
Closing Date.

  

### (i) _Termination of Exchange Fund. _Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for twelve
months after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Buyer, upon demand, and
any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with
this Section 2.1 shall thereafter look only to Buyer and only as
general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for Buyer Common Units,
any Fractional Unit Payment and any distributions with respect to Buyer
Common Units to which such holders may be entitled.

  

### (j) _No Liability. _None of Buyer, MLP or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any person in respect of any Buyer Common Units (or distributions
with respect thereto) or Fractional Unit Payment properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.  If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to
such date on which any Buyer Common Units, any Fractional Unit Payment or
any distributions with respect to Buyer Common Units in respect of such
Certificate would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity, any such units, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, become the
property of Buyer, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

  

### (k) _Affiliates. _Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Certificates surrendered for exchange by any Rule 145 Affiliate (as
determined pursuant to Section 5.5) of MLP shall not be exchanged until Buyer
shall have received from such Rule 145 Affiliate the letter referred to in
Section 5.5.

assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted, except in each
case where the failure to have such power or authority, individually or in

foreign limited partnership, limited liability company,
corporation, unlimited liability company or otherwise, as the case may be, in
each jurisdiction in which the conduct or nature of its business or the

have an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

Approval is the only additional vote of partnership interest holders in MLP

case may be, to own, lease or otherwise hold and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted, except in each
case where the failure to have such power or authority, individually or in
the aggregate, would not have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. Each of the
Buyer Group Entities is duly qualified and in good standing to do business as
a foreign limited partnership, limited liability company,
corporation, unlimited liability company or otherwise, as the case may be, in
each jurisdiction in which the conduct or nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing, holding or operating of its properties makes such

qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not
have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

Meeting of any information that would cause any of the statements in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus to become false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not false or misleading, it will promptly inform the other parties
thereof and take the necessary steps to correct the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. Each of Buyer and MLP will provide the other with
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto prior to filing
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement, and
further agree that each of them will be provided with such number of copies
of all filings made with the SEC as such party shall reasonably request.

the Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto prior to
filing any such document with the SEC. No filings of the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendments or supplements
to either of them) shall be made without the consent of MLP and Buyer (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided
that with respect to documents that are incorporated by reference into the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the foregoing
consent right shall only apply with respect to information relating to the
other party or its business, financial condition or results of operations.
Each of MLP and Buyer shall (1) promptly notify the other of receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff or any other applicable government

government official for amendments or supplements to any of the filings with
the SEC in connection with the Merger and other transactions contemplated
hereby or for additional information and (2) promptly supply the other with
copies of all correspondence between MLP or any of its representatives, or
Buyer or any of its representatives, as the case may be, on the one hand, and
the SEC or its staff or any other applicable government official, on the
other hand, with respect thereto. Buyer and MLP shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration
Statement as promptly as practicable.

  

## SECTION 5.4 _Unitholders  Meetings. _Subject to Section 5.6, the MLP
Parties shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the MLP Partnership
Agreement, cause a meeting of the holders of MLP Common Units and MLP
Subordinated Units (the "MLP Unitholders Meeting") to be duly called and
held as soon as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act to consider and vote upon the adoption and
approval of this Agreement and the Merger. Except as permitted by Section
5.6(c), the MLP Board shall unanimously recommend approval and adoption of
this Agreement and the Merger by the holders of MLP Units and the MLP
Conflicts Committee shall unanimously recommend approval and adoption of this

  



        
   

  



  

Agreement and the Merger by the holders of MLP Common Units (other than
LBPLP) (the "MLP Recommendation") and shall include such MLP Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The Buyer Parties shall, in accordance
with applicable Law and the Buyer Partnership Agreement, cause a meeting of
the holders of Buyer Common Units (the "Buyer Unitholders Meeting") to be
duly called and held as soon as practicable after the Registration Statement
is declared effective under the Securities Act to consider and vote upon the

Recommendation") and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer GP Holdcos
Board of Directors shall be permitted not to recommend to Buyers unitholders
that they give the Buyer Unitholder Approval or to withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to MLP the Buyer Recommendation (any such action being
referred to as a "Buyer Recommendation Change") if the Buyer GP Holdcos
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consulting with outside
legal counsel, that failure to so not recommend or withdraw or modify such
recommendation would be reasonably likely to constitute a violation of the
directors fiduciary obligations under applicable Law.

  

## SECTION 5.5 _Affiliates. _Prior to the Effective Time, MLP shall cause to
be prepared and delivered to Buyer a list identifying all persons who, at
such time or at the Effective Time, MLP reasonably believes may be or will be

(d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (the "Rule 145 Affiliates"). Buyer
shall be entitled to place restrictive legends on any Buyer Common Units
received by such Rule 145 Affiliates. MLP shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each person who is identified as a Rule 145
Affiliate in such list to deliver to Buyer on or prior to the Closing Date a
letter substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 5.5.

  

## SECTION 5.6 _No Solicitation_.

  

### (a) The MLP Parties shall not, and the MLP Parties shall cause their
respective subsidiaries not to, and the MLP Parties shall direct and use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the MLP Parties respective directors,

MLP Conflicts Committee and its members, financial advisors, attorneys and
other advisors (collectively, "Representatives") not to, directly or
indirectly, take any action to solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate the making of any MLP Takeover Proposal or any inquiry
with respect thereto or engage in discussions or negotiations with any person
with respect thereto (except to notify such person of the existence of the
provisions of this Section 5.6), or disclose any non-public information or
afford access to properties, books or records to, any person that has made,
or to the MLP Parties knowledge is considering making, any MLP Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry with respect thereto, or approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, option agreement,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement relating to an MLP Takeover
Proposal, or propose publicly or agree to do any of the foregoing relating to

be terminated, all existing discussions or negotiations with any person
conducted heretofore with respect to any MLP Takeover Proposal.  The MLP
Parties shall enforce, and not terminate or grant any waiver with respect to,
existing confidentiality, standstill or similar agreements. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, at any time prior to (but not after) the date of the MLP
Unitholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written MLP
Takeover Proposal, which MLP Takeover Proposal was not solicited, initiated,
knowingly encouraged or knowingly facilitated by the MLP Parties or their

good faith (A) after consultation with its financial advisor, that the

Superior Proposal and (B) after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a violation of
its fiduciary duties owed to the holders of MLP Units under applicable Law

this Section 5.6, (x) furnish information with respect to the MLP
Group Entities to the person making such MLP Takeover Proposal (and

of this clause (i) being referred to as an "MLP Recommendation Change") or
(ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or allow any
MLP Group Entity to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any MLP Takeover Proposal (other

Takeover Proposal, the MLP Parties will (A) promptly (and in no event later

Change shall occur in any event except as permitted by Section 5.6(c).

cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable. Without limiting the foregoing but

parties hereto shall issue a joint press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement and the Merger and Sale Transactions, which press
release shall be reasonably satisfactory to Buyer General Partner and MLP
General Partner. No party hereto shall issue any other press release or make
any other public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than an MLP Recommendation Change or
Buyer Recommendation Change, public announcements at industry road shows and
conferences, as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with the NYSE, in which event the party making the
public announcement or press release shall, to the extent practicable, notify

the manner described in Section 5.9 of the MLP Disclosure Schedule.

  

## SECTION 5.10 _Regulatory Issues.  _Unless otherwise agreed to by MLP

any condition to a consent or approval of any Governmental Entity necessary
for the consummation of the Merger and Sale Transactions, or to prevent the
entry of any order preventing or delaying the Merger and Sale Transactions at
the request of any Governmental Entity, such Governmental Entity shall
require the divestiture (or the execution of a consent decree that
contemplates such a divestiture) of any assets of the MLP Group Entities (a
"Required Divestiture"), then Buyer General Partner shall agree to cause (or
to agree in the consent decree to cause) such Required Divestitures to be

Purchase Agreement.  Unless otherwise agreed by MLP and Buyer, all Required
Divestitures shall be conditioned on the closing of the Merger. MLP and Buyer
shall cooperate fully with respect to any filing, submission or communication

final copy of all such communications; and (3) complying promptly with any
request for information from a Governmental Entity (including an additional
request for information and documentary material, a "second request"), unless
directed not to do so by the other party hereto. Notwithstanding the prior
two sentences, the MLP Parties agree, and agree to cause each of the
MLP Group Entities, not to participate in any communication with a
Governmental Entity relating to a Required Divestiture, _provided_ that MLP
may review in advance and comment on any written submission to a
Governmental Entity related to a Required Divestiture and observe any oral
communications relating to any Required Divestiture.  All cooperation shall
be conducted in such a manner so as to preserve all applicable privileges.

  

## SECTION 5.11 _Tax Matters._

Parties") who are or at any time prior to the Effective Time were covered by
the existing officers and directors liability insurance applicable to the

satisfy the provisions of this Section 5.13.

  

### (b) The rights of each MLP DandO Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in
addition to any other rights such MLP DandO Indemnified Party may have under
the governing

otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.13 shall survive the consummation
of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the MLP DandO
Indemnified Parties.

consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then and in either such case, Buyer shall cause proper provision to
be made so that its successors and assigns, as the case may be, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 5.13.

  

SECTION 5.14 _Distributions. _The Buyer Parties and the MLP Parties shall
coordinate with each other the declaration of, and the setting of record
dates and payment dates for, distributions in respect of their
respective Common Units so that, in respect of any fiscal quarter, holders of
MLP Common Units do not (a) receive more than one distribution in respect of
both (i) MLP Common Units and (ii) Buyer Common Units received pursuant

 EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

  

## SECTION 7.1 _Employee Matters_.

  

### (a) The employees of General Partner Holdco or Rangeland Pipeline
Partnership who remain in the employment of the MLP Group Entities or the
Buyer Group Entities (the "Continuing Employees") shall receive employee
benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate, as determined in
good faith by Buyer, to the employee benefits provided by Buyer to its
similarly situated employees. At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver
documents reasonably acceptable to MLP providing for the assumption by Buyer
of each employment agreement or severance plan or arrangement (including,
without limitation, the severance arrangements described in Section 3.15 of
the MLP Disclosure Schedule) of the MLP Group Entities.  Buyer agrees to pay
or cause to be paid the severance benefits payable to employees terminated
within twelve months following the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of
the severance arrangements described in Section 3.15 of the MLP Disclosure
Schedule.

  

### (b) Buyer General Partner shall (or shall cause the applicable MLP Group
Entity or Buyer Group Entity to) recognize the service of each Continuing
Employee as if such service had been performed with the Buyer Group Entities
to the extent such service was recognized under a comparable plan of an MLP
Group Entity immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) for purposes of
eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual) under any Buyer Group
Entity defined contribution plan in which such Continuing Employee becomes
eligible to participate, (ii) for purposes of vacation under Buyer General
Partners vacation program, (iii) for purposes of eligibility and
participation under any health or welfare plan maintained by Buyer General
Partner and (iv) for benefit accrual purposes under Buyer General Partners
severance plan.

  

### (c) With respect to any group health plan maintained by Buyer General
Partner in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the
Effective Time, Buyer General Partner shall, and shall cause the MLP Group
Entities and the Buyer Group Entities to, (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting condition exclusions with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such preexisting
condition exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees under
the welfare plans of the MLP Group Entities immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid in the year of the Closing prior to the
Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan for such year.

  

### (d) Following the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set
forth in Article VI (other than conditions that would normally be satisfied
on the Closing Date), but prior to the Effective Time, MLP shall pay or cause
to be paid to specified employees (the "Specified Employees") the retention
benefits described in this Section 7.1(d). No officer of MLP, MLP General
Partner or General Partner Holdco shall be considered to be a
Specified Employee. The aggregate retention benefits ("Retention Benefits")
for all Specified Employees will not exceed $1,250,000. Payments of
Retention Benefits shall be materially consistent with a schedule provided to
Buyer prior to the Execution Date. Retention Benefits shall be subject to
applicable

  

### 

  

### 56   

     
   

  

### 

  

### withholding of taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order for a
Specified Employee to be eligible to receive his or her Retention Benefit,
such Specified Employee must remain in the employ of the MLP Group Entities
with at least a satisfactory performance rating until the date of the
payment.

  

### (e) Following the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set
forth in Article VI (other than conditions that would normally be satisfied
on the Closing Date), but prior to the Effective Time, each employee of any
MLP Group Entity participating in the MLP General Partners Annual Incentive
Plan (as in effect on the date hereof and a true and correct copy of which
has been delivered to Buyer) shall be paid by his employer a cash amount
(less applicable withholding taxes) (A) if the Effective Time occurs during
2006 equal to the product of (i) the target amount payable pursuant to such
Annual Incentive Plan to such person for the 2006 calendar year multiplied by
(ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed in 2006
as of the payment date, and the denominator of which is 365 and (B) if the
Effective Time occurs during 2007, 100% of the target amount payable pursuant
to such Annual Incentive Plan to such person for 2006 plus the product of (i)
the target amount payable pursuant to such Annual Incentive Plan to such
person for 2007 multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days elapsed in 2007 as of the payment date, and the denominator of
which is 365. Such payment shall be in complete satisfaction of any bonus
otherwise payable under the Annual Incentive Plan for 2006 and, if
applicable, 2007. The Annual Incentive Plan covering any 2007 calendar year
payments shall be consistent in all material respects with the Annual
Incentive Plan as in effect on the date hereof. If the Effective Time occurs
during 2007, amounts payable with respect to the 2006 calendar year pursuant
to this Section 7.1(e) shall be payable to any employee of an MLP Group
Entity participating in the MLP General Partners Annual Incentive Plan as of
December 31, 2006, whether or not such employee remains employed by any MLP
Group Entity on the date of payment.

  

### (f) The provisions of this Section 7.1 shall survive the consummation of
the Merger.

  

## SECTION 7.2 _MLP Restricted Units._ (a) As soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of General
Partner Holdco (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the
MLP Unit Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as
may be required to effect the following:

  

#### (i) adjust the terms of each MLP Restricted Unit as necessary to provide
that the restrictions on such units shall lapse at the Effective Time; and

  

#### (ii) make such other changes to the MLP Unit Plans and MLP Employee
Benefit Plans as Buyer General Partner and MLP General Partner may agree are
appropriate to give effect to the Merger.

Agreement shall survive the consummation of the Merger.

  

SECTION 8.7 _Enforcement of this Agreement. _The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that an award of money damages would be inadequate for any breach

or threatened breach of this Agreement by one of the parties, the parties
will also be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other

performance, provided such party is not in material

not exclusive of, any other liability that such party may have at law or in
equity based on such partys (a) fraudulent acts or omissions or (b) willful
misconduct.  None of the provisions set forth in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be a waiver by or release of any party of any right or remedy that
such party may have at law or equity based on any other partys fraudulent
acts or omissions or willful misconduct nor shall any such provisions limit,
or be deemed to limit, (i) the amounts of recovery sought or awarded in any
such claim for fraud or willful misconduct, (ii) the time period during which
a claim for fraud or willful misconduct may be brought, or (iii) the recourse
that any such party may seek against another party with respect to a claim
for fraud or willful misconduct.

maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, the provisions of this Agreement
shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws

Each of the parties hereto agrees that this Agreement involves at least

reliance upon 6 _Del. C._ § 2708. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
and unconditionally confirms and agrees that it is and shall continue to be
(i) subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and of
the federal courts sitting in the State of Delaware, and (ii) subject to
service of process in the State of Delaware. Each party hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (a) consents and submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any federal or state court located in the State of Delaware,
including the Delaware Court of Chancery in and for New Castle County (the
"Delaware Courts") for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(and agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such
courts), (b) waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such
litigation in the Delaware Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any
Delaware Court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in
any inconvenient forum and (c) acknowledges and agrees that any
controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve
complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a

Agreement.

  

SECTION 9.3 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. _Except for the
Confidentiality Agreements, this Agreement and the exhibits and schedules
hereto constitute the entire agreement between and among the parties hereto
pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or

  



        
   

  



  

written, of the parties, and there are no warranties, representations or
other agreements between or among the parties in connection with the subject
matter hereof except as set forth specifically herein or contemplated hereby.
Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement (including the
representations and warranties set forth in Articles III and IV) , (i) the
parties acknowledge and agree that neither the MLP Group Entities nor any
other person has made, and the Buyer Group Entities are not relying upon, any
covenant, representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to the MLP
Group Entities or as to the accuracy or completeness of any information
regarding the any MLP Group Entity furnished or made available to any Buyer
Group Entity and (ii) the MLP Parties shall not have or be subject to any

parties hereto, by or pursuant to action taken by their (or their general
partners) respective boards of directors or conflicts committees, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger and related transactions by the holders of MLP Common Units, but,
after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires
further approval by such unitholders without such further approval. No
supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless
executed in writing by the party to be bound thereby. The failure of a party
to exercise any right or remedy shall not be deemed or constitute a waiver of
such right or remedy in the future.  No waiver of any of the provisions of
this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other
provision hereof (regardless of whether similar), nor shall any such waiver
constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.

  

SECTION 9.4 _Binding Effect and Assignment. _This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns.  Except as provided in Section 5.13,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
person other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any rights, benefits or obligations hereunder.  No
party hereto may assign, transfer, dispose of or otherwise alienate this
Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement
(whether by operation of law or otherwise). Any attempted assignment,
transfer, disposition or alienation in violation of this Agreement shall be
null, void and ineffective.

  

SECTION 9.5 _ Severability.  _If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
applicable Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party
hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in
order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as
