deposited in the Payment Fund with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate, which amounts shall be paid by Exchange Agent
by check or wire transfer in accordance with the instructions provided by such
holder. No interest or dividends will be paid or accrued on the consideration
payable upon the surrender of any Certificate. If the consideration provided for
herein is to be delivered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of such
delivery that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
delivery shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such
delivery to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate, or
that such Person shall establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

            (c) Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 1.11, each outstanding Certificate (other than Certificates representing
Dissenting Shares) will be


                                      -15-
<PAGE>

deemed, from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to
evidence only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Common Merger
Consideration (without interest) in accordance with this Article 1. Each
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

            (d) The applicable portion of the Common Merger Consideration issued
upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of any shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article 1.

            (e) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any amounts that may
be payable to any holder of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement) which remains unclaimed upon the first anniversary of the
Closing Date shall be returned to Purchaser, upon demand, and any such holder
who shall have not theretofore complied with this Article 1 shall, subject to
the remainder of this Section 1.11, thereafter look to Purchaser only as a
general unsecured creditor thereof for payment of any portion of the Common
Merger Consideration, without any interest or dividends thereon, that may be
payable to such holder. Following the Closing, the Exchange Agent shall retain
the right to invest and reinvest the Payment Fund on behalf of the Surviving
Corporation in securities listed or guaranteed by the United States government
or certificates of deposit of commercial banks that have, or are members of a
group of commercial banks that has, consolidated total assets of not less than
$500,000,000, and the Surviving Corporation shall receive the interest earned
thereon. None of Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company or Exchange Agent shall be
liable to a holder of Certificates or any other Person in respect of any cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. If any Certificate (or an affidavit provided pursuant to
Section 1.10(g)) shall not have been surrendered on or before the seventh
anniversary of the Closing Date (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which any portion of the Common Merger Consideration with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Entity), the portion of the Common
Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interests of any person previously entitled
thereto.

            (f) Each of Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common
Stock such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
the Code or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

            (g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Person who is the record owner of such Certificate shall deliver to the
Surviving Corporation an affidavit (in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to the Surviving Corporation) with respect to such


                                      -16-
<PAGE>

loss, theft or destruction. The Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion and
as a condition precedent to the delivery of any portion of the Common Merger
Consideration to such owner in respect of such Certificate, require such Person
to indemnify the Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be made
against the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificate alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed (but shall not require the posting of any
bond or other surety).

            (h) In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Indemnification Escrow
Agreement and the Working Capital Escrow Agreement, as applicable, and in
accordance with this Section, each Company Stockholder (other than any Company
Stockholder whose Company Common Stock becomes Dissenting Shares) shall be paid
such Company Stockholder's proportionate share of the remaining balance, if any,
of (i) the Indemnification Escrow Amount within ten (10) business days after
release thereof in accordance with the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and (ii)
and the Working Capital Escrow Amount within ten (10) business days after
release thereof in accordance with the Working Capital Escrow Agreement.
References in Section 1.7 and this Section 1.11 to payment of the Common Merger
Consideration shall be subject to, and deemed amended as required by, the
provisions of Section 1.13, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and the Working
Capital Escrow Agreement, as applicable.

      1.12 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the
Company and Merger Sub will take all such lawful and necessary action. Purchaser
shall cause Merger Sub to perform all of its obligations relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

      1.13  Working Capital Adjustment to Merger Consideration.

            (a) Working Capital Adjustment. In the event there is a Working
Capital Deficit or a Working Capital Surplus calculated and determined in
accordance with paragraph (c) and (d) of this Section 1.13, then the Merger
Consideration shall be reduced or increased, as the case may be,
dollar-for-dollar by the amount of the Working Capital Deficit or Working
Capital Surplus (the "Working Capital Adjustment"). If there is a Working
Capital Deficit and it is less than $2 million, then an amount equal to the
Working Capital Deficit shall be released from the Working Capital Escrow to
Purchaser and the balance of the Working Capital Escrow Amount shall be released
from the Working Capital Escrow to be distributed to the Company Stockholders in
accordance with this Agreement and the Working Capital Escrow Agreement. If
there is a Final Working Capital Deficit and it is $2 million or greater, then
the entire Working Capital Escrow Amount shall be released from the Working
Capital Escrow to Purchaser; and Purchaser may make a claim against the
Indemnification Escrow Amount for the payment of such difference; and if there
is any balance still due to Purchaser that is not otherwise satisfied by the
Indemnification Escrow Amount, then the Company Stockholders shall be
responsible for payment, severally in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Portions and not jointly, the balance to Purchaser within ten (10) business days
after Purchaser's request. If there is a Working Capital Surplus, then (i)
Purchaser shall within five (5) business days following the


                                      -17-
<PAGE>

determination of Closing Working Capital deposit the amount of such Working
Capital Surplus with the Exchange Agent or the Working Capital Escrow Agent for
payment to the Company Stockholders, (ii) the Working Capital Escrow Amount
shall be released from the Working Capital Escrow, and (iii) each of (i) and
(ii) shall be distributed to the Company Stockholders in accordance with this
Agreement and the Working Capital Escrow Agreement. If there is neither a
Working Capital Deficit nor a Working Capital Surplus, then the Working Capital
Escrow Amount shall be released from Working Capital Escrow to be distributed to
the Company Stockholders in accordance with this Agreement and the Working
Capital Escrow Agreement.

            (b) Closing Statement. Not less than five (5) business days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser and the
Company Stockholder Representative a statement ("Company Closing Statement")
setting forth in reasonable detail the Company's pre-closing calculations of
estimated Working Capital and the estimated Working Capital Deficit, if any, or
estimated Working Capital Surplus, if any, as of the Closing Date.

            (c) Working Capital Adjustment Procedures. A final determination of
Working Capital (the "Closing Working Capital") and the Working Capital Deficit,
if any, or Working Capital Surplus, if any, as of the Closing Date shall be made
after Closing in accordance with this Section for the purpose of determining any
Working Capital Adjustment, if any, required under Section 1.13(a). Not later
than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to the Company Stockholder Representative a statement (the "Purchaser's
Post-Closing Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail Purchaser's final
determinations of the Closing Working Capital and Working Capital Deficit, if
any, or Working Capital Surplus, if any. The Purchaser's Post-Closing Statement
shall be accompanied by supporting schedules setting forth in reasonable detail
all assets and liabilities included in such calculations. The Company Closing
Statement and Purchaser's Post-Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP and otherwise in accordance with the same accounting principles and
policies used in the preparation of the Financial Statements, except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement. In the event that the Company
Stockholder Representative disagrees with the Purchaser's Post-Closing
Statement, then the Company Stockholder Representative shall submit a written
notice of objection thereto to Purchaser within 15 days after the Company
Stockholder Representative's receipt of the Purchaser's Post-Closing Statement.
If within such 15 day period the Company Stockholder Representative does not
submit such a notice of objection, the Closing Working Capital and Working
Capital Deficit, if any, set forth in Purchasers' Post-Closing Statement shall
be deemed accepted, but if the Company Stockholder Representative does timely
object to Purchaser's Post-Closing Statement, such objection shall be resolved
as provided in Section 1.13(d). The Common Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted as provided in Section 1.13(a) based upon the Working Capital Deficit,
if any, or Working Capital Surplus, if any, as so agreed by the parties or
finally determined as provided herein.

            (d) Resolution of Objections. Purchaser and the Company Stockholder
Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute arising
under Section 1.13(c) for a period not to exceed 30 days (except by mutual
agreement and which may be shortened by mutual agreement). Any objection timely
made under Section 1.13(c) that the Company Stockholder Representative and
Purchaser are unable to so resolve shall be determined by a "Neutral Accountant"
as defined below. A "Neutral Accountant" means an accountant or


                                      -18-
<PAGE>

accounting firm mutually agreed by the Parties or, if the Parties fail or are
unable to agree, an independent accounting firm which satisfies each of the
following requirements:

            (i) neither the accountant nor the firm that employs the accountant
      shall have performed any material accounting or consulting services for
      any Party or its Affiliates at any time during the five (5) year period
      immediately preceding the date of the notice from the Company Stockholder
      Representative under Section 1.13(c);

            (ii) is not related in any way to any Party or any executive
      officer, director or Affiliate of any Party;

            (iii) has been a certified public accountant duly licensed to
      practice in the state where he or she has his or her primary office for a
      period of not less than ten (10) years;

            (iv) is willing to accept engagement as the Neutral Accountant on
      the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

      Purchaser and the Company Stockholder Representative agree to use their
reasonable best efforts in good faith to select a Neutral Accountant who is
reasonably acceptable to both of them not later than fifteen (15) days after the
date on which the Company Stockholder Representative timely objects to
Purchaser's Post-Closing Statement. Initially, it is agreed that the Toronto
office of KPMG LLP shall be the Neutral Accountant unless such firm shall
hereafter fail to satisfy the requirements for the Neutral Accountant specified
above.

      Within ten (10) days after the Neutral Accountant is appointed as
described above (or within 10 days after the termination of negotiations
mandated pursuant to the first sentence of this subsection (d) if the Neutral
Accountant remains the firm named above), Purchaser shall promptly forward a
copy of the Purchaser's Post-Closing Statement to the Neutral Accountant, and
the Company Stockholder Representative shall promptly forward a copy of the
written objection(s) thereto delivered pursuant to Section 1.13(c) to the
Neutral Accountant. The Neutral Accountant's role shall be limited to resolving
such objections. In resolving such objections, the Neutral Accountant shall
apply the provisions of this Agreement concerning determination of the Closing
Working Capital and Working Capital Deficit, as applicable. The Neutral
Accountant shall promptly provide written notice of its resolution of such
objections to Purchaser and the Company Stockholder Representative and the
resulting determinations of the Closing Working Capital and Working Capital
Deficit, if any, shall be final and binding on the Parties. The Neutral
Accountant shall be instructed to use reasonable efforts to perform its services
within thirty (30) days of submission of the statement(s) and objection(s) to it
and, in any case, as soon as practicable after such submission. If the Neutral
Accountant selected as described above is unable or unwilling to act when called
upon pursuant to this Section 1.13(d), then the parties shall promptly appoint a
substitute to act in substitution for the original designee, (or if no
substitute is so appointed within fifteen (15) days, then such dispute shall be
resolved by a single arbitrator, sitting in New York, New York, appointed by the
American Arbitration Association upon application by either Purchaser or the
Company Stockholder Representative), and, upon acceptance of such appointment
such substitute, or arbitrator so appointed, shall for purposes of this
Agreement be deemed the Neutral Accountant, as applicable, and the time


                                      -19-
<PAGE>

periods prescribed above in this Section 1.13(d) shall run from the date of such
substitute's or arbitrator's acceptance of appointment hereunder.

      1.14  Dissenters' Rights.

            (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary
other than Section 1.14(b), any shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder
who duly and validly demands appraisal of such shares in accordance with
Delaware Law and is in compliance with all the provisions of Delaware Law
concerning the right of such holder to demand appraisal of such shares in
connection with the Merger and who, as of the Effective Time, has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal or dissenters' rights ("Dissenting
Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive any
portion of the Common Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.7, but instead
shall be converted into the right to receive only such consideration as may be
determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares under Delaware Law.

            (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.7, if any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock who demands payment for such shares under
Delaware Law shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) such holder's appraisal rights, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder's shares shall no
longer be Dissenting Shares and shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Common Merger
Consideration, as provided in Section 1.7, without interest thereon, upon
surrender of the certificate representing such shares in accordance with Section
1.11.

            (c) The Company shall give Purchaser (i) prompt notice of the
receipt of any written notice of any demand for payment or intent to demand
payment for any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and
any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the
Company which relate to any such demand for payment and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings which take place prior to the
Effective Time with respect to demands for payment under Delaware Law. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Purchaser, either
(y) voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for payment for
Company Common Stock or offer to settle or settle any such demands or (z) make
any offer to buy, or accept any offer to sell, any shares of Company Common
Stock.

      1.15  Company Stockholder Representative.

            (a) Appointment; Powers. In order to administer efficiently the
assertion, defense, settlement and resolution of any claims for indemnification
pursuant to Article 6 and any other disputes or matters arising in connection
with this Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the Working Capital
Escrow Agreement or any other agreement entered into by the Company Stockholder
Representative on behalf of the Company Stockholders as contemplated hereunder,
upon the approval of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders in accordance
with Delaware Law, the Company Stockholder Representative shall be exclusively
(except in case of clause (iv) and clause (v) below in the event of a claim not
generally applicable to the Stockholders (a "Particular Claim"), in which case
such authorization shall be


                                      -20-
<PAGE>

non-exclusive) authorized and empowered to: (i) to the extent permitted by
applicable law, amend, modify or waive any of the provisions of this Agreement,
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the Working Capital Escrow Agreement or
any other agreement contemplated hereby on behalf of the Company Stockholders in
any manner in which the Company Stockholder Representative believes to be in the
best interests of the Company Stockholders; (ii) give all notices (including
service of process) required to be given by or on behalf of any Company
Stockholder under this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby;
(iii) take any action (or determine to take no action) in connection with the
defense, settlement, compromise, arbitration and/or other resolution of any
claim for indemnification by any Purchaser Indemnified Party (as defined below)
pursuant to Article 6 hereof, including compliance with any Order in connection
with any such claim, or any other claim, arbitration, dispute, action, suit, or
other proceeding in connection with this Agreement; (iv) assert, bring,
prosecute, maintain, settle, compromise, arbitrate and/or otherwise resolve on
behalf of the Company Stockholders any claim for indemnification by any Company
Stockholder Indemnified Party (as defined below) pursuant to Article 6 hereof or
any other claim, arbitration, dispute, action, suit, or other proceeding in
connection with this Agreement; and (v) take all such other actions (or
determine to take no action) as the Company Stockholder Representative may deem
necessary or appropriate in his sole judgment to carry out the foregoing. By
his/its execution hereof, the Company Stockholder Representative hereby accepts
such appointment.

            (b) Removal. The Company Stockholders may, at any time, remove the
Company Stockholder Representative and appoint a substitute representative by
written consent signed by Company Stockholders (or, if applicable, their
respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns) who held a
majority of the voting power represented by the shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If the Company
Stockholder Representative dies, becomes unable to perform his responsibilities
hereunder or resigns from such position, the Company Stockholders shall, by such
written consent, appoint a substitute representative to fill such vacancy. Any
such substitute representative shall be deemed to be the Company Stockholder
Representative for all purposes of this Agreement. Upon the selection of such
substitute representative, the substituted representative shall promptly notify
Purchaser in writing of his or her appointment pursuant to this Section 1.15(b),
which written notice shall be accompanied by a copy of the written consent
effectuating such appointment.

            (c) Exclusive Right. Any claim, arbitration, action, suit, or other
proceeding, whether in law or equity, to enforce any right, benefit or remedy
granted to the Company Stockholders under this Agreement shall be asserted,
brought, prosecuted or maintained only by the Company Stockholder
Representative, except with respect to Particular Claims in connection with
which the affected Stockholders may act independently of the Stockholder
Representative. Except with respect to Particular Claims, all actions, decisions
and instructions of the Company Stockholder Representative, including the
defense, settlement, compromise and/or other resolution of any claims for
indemnification by any Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to Article 6, shall
be conclusive and binding upon all of the Company Stockholders, and no Company
Stockholder shall have any right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise
contest the same, nor have any claim or cause of action against the Company
Stockholder Representative for any action taken or not taken, decision made or
instruction given by the Company Stockholder


                                      -21-
<PAGE>

Representative under this Agreement, except for fraud, gross negligence or
willful misconduct by the Company Stockholder Representative.

            (d) Reliance. Except with respect to Particular Claims, Purchaser
shall be able to rely conclusively on the actions, decisions and instructions of
the Company Stockholder Representative as to the settlement, compromise and/or
other resolution of any claims for indemnification by any Purchaser Indemnified
Party pursuant to Article 6 or any other actions required or permitted to be
taken by the Company Stockholder Representative under this Agreement, and no
Party hereunder shall have any claim or cause of action against any Purchaser
Indemnified Party for any action taken by such Purchaser Indemnified Party in
reliance upon the actions, decisions and instructions of the Company Stockholder
Representative.

            (e) Information and Access. The Company Stockholder Representative
and its representatives and agents shall have reasonable access to information
about the Company, Surviving Corporation and Purchaser and the reasonable
assistance of the Company's, Surviving Corporation's and Purchaser's officers
and employees for purposes of performing its duties and exercising its rights
hereunder, including in the case of the Working Capital Adjustment, access to
working papers and other books and records the Company Stockholder
Representative and/or its representatives and agents may reasonably request;
provided, however, that the Company Stockholder Representative shall treat
confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about the
Company, Surviving Corporation or Purchaser to anyone other than its
representatives and agents (except on a need to know basis to individuals who
agree to treat such information confidentially).

            (f) Indemnification. The Company Stockholder Representative shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Company Stockholders from all Losses
arising out of or in connection with the Company Stockholder Representative's
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, except for fraud, gross
negligence or willful misconduct by the Company Stockholder Representative. If
at any time the Company Stockholder Representative and any other Person shall
have any unsatisfied claims against the Company Stockholders pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, the claims of the Company Stockholder Representative
shall be satisfied first including out of funds comprising the Indemnity Escrow
Amount and the Working Capital Escrow Amount, subject to the limits set forth in
the Indemnified Escrow Agreement and the Working Capital Escrow Agreement, as
applicable. The Company Stockholder Representative shall have the right to make
demands of the Company Stockholders directly, pro rata in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Portions of the Common Merger Consideration, for such
indemnification and for payment of any fees and expenses (including attorneys'
fees and expenses) incurred in the discharge of the Company Stockholder
Representative's duties hereunder, which demand shall be promptly honored by the
Company Stockholders. Without in any way limiting the rights of the Company
Stockholder Representative as against the Company Stockholders, neither the
Company nor Purchaser shall have any liability or obligation whatsoever to the
Company Stockholder Representative arising out of or relating to any breach or
alleged breach by the Company Stockholders of their indemnification obligations
to the Company Stockholder Representative as contemplated hereby.

            (g) Attorney-in-fact. Upon approval of this Agreement by the Company
Stockholders, the Company Stockholder Representative, or any assignee or
successor thereof,


                                      -22-
<PAGE>

acting as hereinafter provided, shall be irrevocably appointed as the
attorney-in-fact and agent of the Company Stockholders (except with respect to
Company Stockholders, if any, who have caused their Company Common Stock to
become Dissenting Shares) to act in its, his or her name, place and stead in
connection with all matters arising from and under this Agreement, the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the Working Capital Escrow Agreement and any
other agreement entered into by the Company Stockholder Representative on behalf
of the Company Stockholders, and acknowledges that such appointment is coupled
with an interest.

            (h) Severability. The provisions of this Section 1.15 are
independent and severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and
shall be enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Company
Stockholder may have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

            (i) Binding Effect. The provisions of this Section 1.15 shall be
binding upon the heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns of each
Company Stockholder, and any references in this Agreement to a Company
Stockholder or the Company Stockholders shall mean and include the successors to
the rights of the Company Stockholders hereunder, whether pursuant to
testamentary disposition, the laws of descent and distribution, assignment or
otherwise.

      1.16 Approvals. The approval of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders
shall constitute approval of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and the
Working Capital Escrow Agreement and the appointment of the Company Stockholder
Representative, the Indemnification Escrow Agent and the Working Capital Escrow
Agent.

                                   ARTICLE 2
                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

      Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule attached hereto,
the Company makes the following representations and warranties to Purchaser as

      2.1 Organization. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The
Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business
as now being conducted and to own the properties and assets it now owns and is
duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation in good
standing in every jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, except
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has provided
Purchaser with true, correct and complete copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws of the Company as currently in effect.

      2.2   Subsidiaries.

            (a) Section 2.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth: (i)

            (b) Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization. Each Subsidiary of the Company has the power to
own its properties and to carry on its business as currently conducted. Each
Subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business and in
good standing as a foreign entity in each jurisdiction where the properties
owned, leased or operated by it, or the business conducted by it, require such
qualification or license, except in those jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified or licensed would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has delivered a true, correct and complete copy of each of each of its
Subsidiaries' organization documents, each as amended to date and in full force
and effect on the date hereof, to Purchaser.

      2.3   Authorization.

hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part
of the Company, subject only to the filing of Certificate of Merger pursuant to
Delaware Law.

            (b) The board of directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called
and held, has (i) adopted the plan of merger set forth in this Agreement and

remedy of specific performance or injunctive or other forms of equitable relief
may be subject to equitable defenses and would be subject to the discretion of

      2.5   Consents and Approvals; No Violations.

            (a) Except for the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, and the Antitrust Filings and Other
Filings, none of the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement,
the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder, nor the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
without limitation the Saxon Divestiture, will (i) conflict with or result in

approval of, any Governmental Entity.

After the date of this Agreement, without the approval of Purchaser, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will assign or transfer to Saxon any IP or
other assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not set forth in Section
4.1(o) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; provided that the foregoing shall not
be deemed to restrict the Company from completing any assignment or

Disclosure Schedule as currently pending or in progress, or, subject to
Purchaser's approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, from correcting any administrative errors.

any amended Tax Return, enter into any closing Contract, settle any Tax claim or
assessment, Knowingly surrender any right to claim a refund of Taxes, consent to
any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or
assessment, or take any other similar action relating to the filing of any Tax
Return or the payment of any Tax, if such election, amendment, Contract,
settlement, surrender, consent or other action would have the effect of
increasing the Tax liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any
period ending after the Closing Date; provided, however, that this Section 4.2
shall not apply to the filing by the Company and its Subsidiaries of their
respective federal and state income Tax Returns in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice.

                                    ARTICLE 5
                                    COVENANTS

      5.1 Stockholder Approval. Promptly after the execution of this Agreement,
the Company shall take such action as shall be necessary under Delaware Law to
submit this Agreement to the Company Stockholders for their approval by written
consent. The Company shall solicit the written consent of such Company
Stockholders as shall be necessary to achieve the Required Stockholder Vote as
promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement. Within ten
business days after the execution by Company Stockholders holding at least a
majority of the Company Common Stock of an action by written consent of Company
Stockholders approving this Agreement, the Company shall circulate to the
remaining holders of Company Common Stock written notice and appropriate
informational materials as and to the extent required under Delaware Law of the
taking of corporate action by less than unanimous


                                      -45-
<PAGE>

written consent of the Company Stockholders (the "Stockholder Notification").
The Stockholder Notification (if any be required) shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to each of Purchaser and the Company. The Stockholder
Notification shall include (i) notice under Delaware Law that the holders of
Company Common Stock are or may be entitled to assert dissenters' or appraisal
rights under such law, (ii) a copy of this Agreement, and (iii) other
appropriate informational materials. Each of Purchaser and the Company shall
provide promptly to the other such information concerning its business and
affairs as the other shall reasonably request for inclusion in such Stockholder
Notification. The Company will promptly advise Purchaser, and Purchaser will
promptly advise the Company, if at any time prior to the Effective Time either
the Company or Purchaser, as applicable, shall obtain knowledge of any facts
that might make it necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement the
Stockholder Notification in order to make the statements contained or
incorporated by reference therein not misleading or to comply with applicable
law.

      5.2 Access. Until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to its terms, the Company shall give Purchaser and its
authorized representatives reasonable access to all books, records, personnel,
offices and other facilities and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that any such access to the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
facilities shall be conducted at Purchaser's expense in the sole discretion of
the Company, at a reasonable time during normal business hours, under the
supervision of the Company's personnel and in such a manner as to maintain the
confidentiality of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
not to interfere unreasonably with the normal operation of the business of the
Company. Nothing herein shall require the Company to disclose any information to
Purchaser if such disclosure would (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other
legal privilege; or (ii) contravene any applicable Legal Requirements, fiduciary
duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
(including any confidentiality agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party); provided that the Company shall advise Purchaser of
any such information that is withheld solely by reason of a confidentiality
agreement with a third party and the parties will use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such disclosure.

      5.3 Confidentiality. Purchaser and the Company acknowledge that they are
parties to that certain Nondisclosure Agreement, dated as of April 27, 2006 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), which agreement shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms.

      5.4 No Solicitation. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time, sixty (60) days following the date hereof or the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms, the Company will not, nor
will the Company authorize or permit (to the extent within its power and
authority) any of its directors, officers, Subsidiaries, Affiliates or employees
or any investment banker, advisor, representative or other agent of the Company
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or induce the making,
submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) participate in or
encourage any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person
any nonpublic information with respect to, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal.

      5.5 Public Disclosure. Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company and the Company
Stockholder Representative will not make any public disclosure concerning the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
written consent of Purchaser and the Company, except as may be required by any
applicable Legal Requirement.

      5.6   Reasonable Efforts; Notification.

            (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the Parties agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable (subject to any applicable Legal Requirements) to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using all
commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) causing the
conditions precedent set forth in Article 7 to be satisfied; (ii) defending any
Legal Proceeding challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed; and (iii) executing and delivering any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement.

            (b) Promptly after the date hereof, the Company shall give all
notices required to be given to third parties in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the Company shall obtain prior to the
Closing all consents identified or required to be identified in Section 2.5 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule.

            (c) Purchaser and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, will give prompt notice to the other of (i) any notice or other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may
be required in connection with the Merger; (ii) any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger; and
(iii) any Legal Proceeding relating to, involving or otherwise affecting the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

      5.7   Antitrust and Other Filings.

            (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, in the case of the Antitrust Filing required under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, not later than three Business Days following such
execution, each of Purchaser and the Company shall prepare and file (i) any
pre-merger notification forms required by the merger notification or control
laws and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, as agreed to by Purchaser
and the Company (the "Antitrust Filings") and (ii) any other filings required to
be filed by it under the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or any other Legal
Requirement relating to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Other Filings"). Each of Purchaser and the Company shall promptly supply the
other with any information which may reasonably be required in order to
effectuate any filings pursuant to this Section 5.7. Concurrently with the
filing of the Antitrust Filings, or as soon thereafter as practicable, Purchaser
and the Company shall each request early termination of any waiting period under
any applicable Legal Requirement that permits such request for early
termination.


                                      -47-
<PAGE>

            (b) Each of Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company shall notify the
other promptly upon the receipt of any comments from any Governmental Entity in
connection with any filing made pursuant hereto and of any request for
amendments or supplements to any Antitrust Filing or Other Filing or for
additional information and shall supply the other with copies of all
correspondence between such Party or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Entity, on the other hand, with respect to the Merger
or any Antitrust Filing or Other Filing. Each of Purchaser, Merger Sub and the
Company shall cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with any
Governmental Entity to comply in all material respects with all Legal
Requirements. Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any Antitrust Filing or Other Filing, Purchaser or
the Company, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other of such
occurrence and cooperate in filing such amendment or supplement with the
appropriate Governmental Entity. Purchaser and the Company shall each pay fifty
percent (50%) of any and all filing fees, assessments or charges imposed by any
Governmental Entity in connection with any Antitrust Filings or Other Filings.

      5.8 Disclosure. Prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall give prompt
notice to the other Parties of: (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is likely to cause any
representation or warranty of such Party contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any Material respect at or prior to the Effective Time,
and (b) any failure of such Party to comply with or satisfy, in any Material
respect, any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 5.8 shall not (i) limit or otherwise affect any remedies available
to the Party receiving such notice or (ii) constitute an acknowledgement or
admission of a breach of this Agreement. In addition, until the Closing, the
Company may from time to time deliver to Purchaser such additions to or
modifications of any section of the Disclosure Schedule necessary to make the
information set forth therein and in the Sections and subsections of this
Agreement true, accurate and complete in all Material respects; provided,
however, that such supplemental disclosure shall not be deemed to be included in
the Company's representations for purposes of satisfying the condition to
Closing in Section 8.3(a) unless accepted (or not objected to) by Purchaser, in
which case such additional disclosures shall be deemed to modify and supplement
the Company's representations for all purposes hereunder.

      5.9 Employee Benefit Plans. For a period of six (6) months after the
Effective Time, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall either (i)
maintain in effect, on the same terms and conditions as shall be in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Plans that are "group health plans"
subject to Section 4980B of the Code in which any Company Employee shall
participate as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii) provide
substantially equivalent group health benefits to the Company Employees (and
other covered persons). Group health benefits under a plan shall not be
"substantially equivalent" for purposes of this Section 5.9 unless such plan
shall (to the extent applicable) (x) recognize expenses and claims that were
incurred by the Company Employees (and other covered persons) in the year in
which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of computing deductible amounts,
co-payments or other limitations on coverage under such plan; (y) provide
coverage for pre-existing health conditions of any Company Employee (and other
covered persons), except to the extent that such pre-existing condition would
have been excluded under the terms of the Plan in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time; and (z) take into account the service of the Company
Employee for


                                      -48-
<PAGE>

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for
eligibility, vesting, benefit computation, accrual and other purposes. Nothing
in this Section 5.9 shall require the inclusion of any Company Employee (or any
other covered person) in any benefit plan of Purchaser. Nothing in this Section
5.9 shall obligate the Surviving Corporation to employ any person for any period
of time after the Closing, and this Section 5.9 shall not be construed to limit
the ability of the Surviving Corporation to alter the terms and conditions of,
or terminate, the employment of any person (other than with respect to benefits
as provided herein).

      5.10  Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance Plans.

            (a) Purchaser and Merger Sub agree that all rights to
indemnification and exculpation (including the advancement of expenses) from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby) now existing in
favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as provided in the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and
By-Laws or other organizational documents of a Subsidiary, or in any written
indemnification agreement with the officers, directors or agents of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the
Merger, without further action, as of the Effective Time and shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms, and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all such
rights. The Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and
indemnification (including the advancement of expenses) that are at least as
favorable to the current or former directors, officers, employees and agents of
the Company as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws
of the Company as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of seven years after the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were directors,
officers, employees or agents of the Company, unless such modification is
required by law.

            (b) On or before the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to obtain, at Purchaser's expense, a non-cancelable runoff
insurance policy for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Closing
Date to provide insurance coverage (which coverage shall be at least as
favorable to the insureds as the coverage now in effect) for events, acts or
omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date for all persons who were
directors or officers of the Company on or prior to the Closing Date.

            (c) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, or otherwise dissolves, then, and in each
such case, Purchaser shall cause proper provision to be made so the successors
and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 5.10.

      (d) The provisions of this Section 5.10: (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party and his or her
heirs, executors and legal representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to


                                      -49-
<PAGE>

indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or
otherwise; provided, however, that such third parties shall have no rights or
remedies under this Agreement until after the Effective Time.

      5.11 Company 401(k) Plan(s). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall terminate its 401(k) plan(s) effective as of the date immediately prior to
the Effective Time, but contingent on the Effective Time. Purchaser hereby
agrees that it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its 401(k)
plan to accept direct rollovers of notes representing participant loans that
constitute "eligible rollover distributions" within the meaning of Section
402(c) of the Code from or relating to the Company's 401(k) plan(s) by employees
of the Company who become employees of Purchaser or Merger Sub by reason of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Rollover amounts contributed to Purchaser's
401(k) plan in accordance with this Section 5.11 shall at all times be one
hundred percent (100%) vested and shall be invested in accordance with the
provisions of Purchaser's 401(k) plan.

      5.12 Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, each of
the Parties shall grant such approvals and take such lawful actions as are
necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover Statute and any
regulations promulgated thereunder on such transactions.

      5.13 Saxon Divestiture.

            (a) Divestiture. Prior to the Closing, the Company intends to sell
either its ownership interest in Saxon or all of Saxon's assets, or,
alternatively, at the Company's sole discretion the equity interests of Saxon
may be distributed to the Company's Stockholders by means of a dividend (i.e., a
"spin-off"), which spin-off the Company shall be required to effect if the sale
of Saxon or its assets shall not have occurred prior to Closing (referred to
herein as the "Saxon Divestiture").

            (b) License. The Saxon IP shall remain subject to each of those
certain Patent License Agreements, dated May 4, 2007 and March 24, 2006, by and
between Legerity, Inc. and Saxon, as amended in accordance with this Section
(the "Saxon License Agreements"). Within five days of the date hereof, and
before entering into the Saxon Divestiture, the Company shall: (i) have each
such Saxon License Agreement amended to specify that such agreement may be
assigned to Purchaser and its Affiliates (whether now existing or in the future
becoming so) after the closing hereunder; and (ii) if the Saxon IP encompasses
IP in addition to the IP included in the Saxon License Agreements, the May 4,
2007 Saxon License Agreement shall be further amended to include such additional
IP.

            (c) Other Agreements. In connection with the Saxon Divestiture, the
Company and its Subsidiaries also will be granted a covenant not to sue with
respect to the Saxon IP and a release, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser, releasing the Purchaser, the Company and its
Subsidiaries from any and all claims, actions and all other liabilities which
the acquiror of the Saxon IP then has or ever will have against the Purchaser,
the Company or such Subsidiaries arising out of the Saxon Divestiture or the
Saxon Divestiture Agreements (except to the limited extent of escrows
established as provided below). The Saxon IP shall be subject to such Saxon
License Agreements and covenant, regardless of any future


                                      -50-
<PAGE>

transfer thereof or any other right granted therein. The purchaser of the
ownership interest in Saxon or all of Saxon's assets shall acknowledge in
writing the Saxon License Agreements and such covenant, and any future purchaser
of or holder of right in or to any such Saxon IP shall be obligated to
acknowledge in writing such licenses and covenant if reasonably requested by
Purchaser (or its successors under the license terms).

      (d) Saxon Divestiture Agreements; Escrow for Liabilities. Prior to
execution and delivery thereof by Saxon, the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company, the Company shall provide Purchaser with copies of all agreements and
documents to be entered into or executed by Saxon, the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company in connection with the Saxon Divestiture (collectively, the
"Saxon Divestiture Agreements"). The Saxon Divestiture Agreements shall be in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, provided that in no
event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or, if it is to remain as a
subsidiary of the Company following the Closing, Saxon, have any indemnification
or other obligation or liability, contingent or otherwise, under or arising from
or related to the Saxon Divestiture Agreements, any of the Saxon IP or otherwise
following the Saxon Divestiture. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated
herein,

            (A) if the Saxon Divestiture Agreements contain any representations,
      warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company or any of its
      Subsidiaries (including, for purposes of this provision only, Saxon if it
      remains a subsidiary of Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation following
      the Merger) that survive the closing the Saxon Divestiture and that impose
      or reasonably could be expected to impose any indemnification obligation,
      liability, loss, cost or expense on Purchaser, the Company or any of its
      Subsidiaries (collectively, "Liability") and, notwithstanding the
      inclusion of such provisions Purchaser has deemed the Saxon Divestiture
      Agreements satisfactory as contemplated above, then

                  (i) if the Saxon Divestiture Agreements provide for an overall
            cap on the indemnification obligations of Saxon, the Company or any
            of its Subsidiaries in favor of the purchaser thereunder (the "Saxon
            Indemnity Cap"), such portion of the cash proceeds from the Saxon
            Divestiture as is equal to the Saxon Indemnity Cap shall be
            deposited into escrow pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement,
            in form and substance substantially consistent with the
            Indemnification Escrow Agreement, to secure any claims that may be
            made against Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and

                  (ii) if the Saxon Divestiture Agreements do not provide for an
            overall cap on such indemnification, such portion of such cash
            proceeds as is equal to the dollar amount of the mutually agreed
            (which mutual agreement will not be unreasonably withheld by the
            Company or Purchaser) potential Liability under the Saxon
            Divestiture Agreements shall be so deposited, in each case for a
            period of time equal to the post-closing period during which any
            such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or
            potential Liability survive under the terms of the applicable Saxon
            Divestiture Agreements; and


                                      -51-
<PAGE>

            (B) The Saxon Divestiture Agreements shall expressly provide that
      Saxon (or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be),
      shall have the right to terminate the Saxon Divestiture Agreements if for
      any reason the closing thereunder shall not have occurred on or before
      July 20, 2007.

            (e) Spin-off. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the
Company and Purchaser are unable to reach agreement regarding the matters in
this Section 5.13, the Company shall effect the Saxon Divestiture prior to
Closing by means of a dividend or distribution of Saxon's equity interests to
the Company Stockholders; provided that the spun-off entity remains subject to
the Saxon License Agreements.

                                    ARTICLE 6
                          INDEMNIFICATION AND SURVIVAL

      6.1 Survival Period. The representations and warranties of Purchaser,
Merger Sub and the Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered at the Closing shall survive the Closing Date and continue in effect
for a period of 12 months after the Closing Date except for representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Sections 2.6 (Capitalization), 2.15
(Employee Benefit Plans), 2.16 (Tax Matters) and 2.19 (Environmental Compliance)
and except for the obligation to indemnify pursuant to Article 7, which shall
survive for the period of the applicable statutes of limitation (as applicable,
the "Survival Period"), after which such representations and warranties shall
terminate immediately. Claims based upon or arising out of such representations
and warranties may only be asserted on or before the expiration of the
applicable Survival Period. All covenants and agreements that by their terms are
to be performed after the Closing shall expire upon the completion of
performance or waiver thereof. Claims based upon or arising out of covenants and
agreements of the Company to be performed at or prior to the Closing may only be
asserted on or before the expiration of the applicable Survival Period. No
knowledge of, or investigation by or on behalf of, any Party shall constitute or
effectuate a waiver of such Party's rights to indemnification under this Article
6. The termination of representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
provided in this Section 6.1 shall not affect the rights of any Indemnified
Party (as defined below) in respect of any claim made by any Indemnified Party
in a writing received by the Indemnifying Party (as defined below) pursuant to
and in compliance with the provisions of this Article 6 and Article 7 prior to
the expiration of the applicable Survival Period. Except to the extent provided
herein, the Parties intend to shorten the statute of limitations and agree that
no claims or causes of action based upon, directly or indirectly, any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements terminated as provided in
this Section 6.1 may be brought after the expiration of the applicable Survival
Period. No representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of any Party
contained in this Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement
except as provided in Section 9.2.

      6.2 Indemnification of Purchaser. Subject to the limitations set forth in
this Article 6, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents and Affiliates, and the respective heirs,
executors, personal representatives, successors and assigns of the foregoing
Persons (the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties"), shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Company Stockholders, severally in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Portions and not jointly, from and against and in respect of
all Losses arising


                                      -52-
<PAGE>

out of or resulting from (i) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation
or warranty contained in Article 2 of this Agreement, the Company Officer's
Certificate or the Secretary's Certificate; (ii) any breach of any covenant or
agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement; (iii) indemnification for
Taxes under Section 7.1; and (iv) any matter arising out of or relating to the
Saxon Divestiture.

      6.3 Indemnification of the Company Stockholders. Subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article 6, the Company Stockholders, their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents, Subsidiaries and Affiliates,
and the respective heirs, executors, personal representatives, successors and
assigns of the foregoing Persons (the "Company Stockholder Indemnified
Parties"), shall be indemnified and held harmless by Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation from and against and in respect of all Losses arising out of or
resulting from (i) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or
warranty contained in Article 3 of this Agreement or any certificate delivered
by Purchaser or Merger Sub at the Closing, (ii) indemnification for Taxes under
Article 7, or (iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser or
Merger Sub contained in this Agreement.

      6.4 Procedure for Claims between Parties. If a claim for Losses is to be
made by a Person entitled to indemnification hereunder (an "Indemnified Party"),
the Indemnified Party shall give written notice (a "Claim Notice"), in the case
of claims pursuant to Section 6.2 and Section 7.1, to the Company Stockholder
Representative, and in the case of claims pursuant to Section 6.3, to Purchaser
(each Person so notified being referred to as the "Indemnifying Party") promptly
after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact, condition or event which
may give rise to Losses for which indemnification may be sought under this
Article 6 or Article 7. Any failure to provide any such Claim Notice in a timely
manner to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced by such failure. Each Claim Notice shall set forth: (i) the specific
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement alleged to have been breached;
(ii) the nature and amount of the claim asserted, together with sufficient facts
relating thereto so that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably evaluate such
claim; and (iii) a calculation or good faith estimate, if such can be reasonably
calculated, of the aggregate Losses to which the Indemnified Party believes it
is entitled in connection with the claim. If the Indemnifying Party, within
twenty (20) business days after receipt of the Claim Notice, does not give
written notice to the Indemnified Party stating its intent to contest such
claim, the claim shall be deemed accepted and the amount of the claim shall be
deemed a valid claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall, within ten (10) business
days after expiration of the prior notice period, deliver to the Indemnified
Party the amount of the Losses with respect to the claim. If the Indemnifying
Party shall contest the assertion of a claim by giving such written notice to
the Indemnified Party within such period (a "Dispute Notice"), then the Parties
shall act in good faith to reach agreement regarding such claim.

      6.5   Arbitration.

            (a) If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall not
have reached agreement regarding the claim that is the subject of a Dispute
Notice within thirty (30) days of delivery of the Dispute Notice, then each of
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, by
delivery of written notice to the other (the "Arbitration Notice"),


                                      -53-
<PAGE>

to submit the matter to binding arbitration in Austin, Texas. Such matter shall
then be settled by three arbitrators in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association (the
"AAA Rules"). Each of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
designate one arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the delivery of the
Arbitration Notice. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cause
such designated arbitrators mutually to agree upon and designate a third
arbitrator; provided, however, that (i) failing such agreement within sixty (60)
days of delivery of the Arbitration Notice, the third arbitrator shall be
appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules and (ii) if either the Indemnified
Party or the Indemnifying Party shall fail to timely designate an arbitrator,
the dispute shall be resolved by the one arbitrator timely designated. The fees
and expenses of designated arbitrators and the third arbitrator, if any, shall
be borne equally by the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party (and, if
the Company Stockholder Representative shall be the Indemnifying Party, the
Company Stockholder Representative's portion of such fees and expenses shall be
paid exclusively by the Company Stockholders). The Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall cause the arbitrators to decide the matter to be
arbitrated pursuant hereto within sixty (60) days after confirmation of the
appointment of the last arbitrator. The arbitrators' decision shall relate
solely to whether the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive the claimed
damages (or a portion thereof) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The
final decision of the majority of the arbitrators shall be furnished to the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in writing and shall constitute a
conclusive, final and non-appealable determination of the issue in question,
binding upon the Indemnified Parties and the Indemnifying Parties, as
applicable, and their successors and assigns. Such decision may be used in a
court of law only for the purpose of seeking enforcement of the arbitrators'
award. Any award granted by the arbitrators will be subject to the limitations
contained in this Article 6.

            (b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives its right to file claims in any court of law or equity (other than to
enforce the arbitrators' award) with respect to any and all disputes arising out
of or from or relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit any and all
such disputes to the exclusive jurisdiction of the American Arbitration
Association.

            (c) The Parties hereby exclude and waive any right of appeal to any
court of law or equity on the merits of any and all disputes. Subject to Section
10.6, the provisions of this Section 6.5 may be enforced in any court having
jurisdiction over the arbitrators' award or any of the Parties or any of their
respective assets, and judgment on the award (including equitable remedies)
granted in any arbitration hereunder may be entered in any such court.

            (d) The prevailing Party in any arbitration (or any action, suit or
proceeding to enforce the arbitrators' award) shall be entitled to recover such
Party's reasonable costs and attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such
arbitration (or such action, suit or proceeding).

      6.6 Defense of Third-Party Claims. If any action, suit or proceeding is
filed or any claim is made against any Indemnified Party by a third party, and
such Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement
with respect to such claim, such Indemnified Party shall give written notice
thereof to the Indemnifying Party as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within five (5) calendar days after receipt of service of process or other
notice of such action, suit, proceeding or claim). The failure of any
Indemnified Party to


                                      -54-
<PAGE>

give timely notice hereunder shall not affect any rights to indemnification
hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced by such failure. After such notice, the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled, if it so elects and at its own expense (subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article 6), (a) to take control of the defense and investigation
of such action, suit, proceeding or claim; (b) to employ and engage attorneys of
its own choice to handle and defend the same; provided, however, that the
Indemnified Party may participate in any action, suit, proceeding or claim with
attorneys of its own choice and at its own expense; and provided further that if
the named parties to such action, suit, proceeding or claim include both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party (or, if the Company Stockholder
Representative is the Indemnifying Party, any Company Stockholder), and the
Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by its counsel that there may be
one or more legal defenses available to such Indemnified Party that are
different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at the Indemnifying Party's expense
(subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 6), to separate counsel of
its own choosing; and (c) to negotiate, compromise or settle such claim, which
compromise or settlement shall be made only with the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. The
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its attorneys
in the investigation, trial and defense of such action, suit, proceeding or
claim and any appeal arising therefrom. In the case of Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation, such cooperation shall include the retention, and the
provision to the Company Stockholder Representative upon request, of records and
information reasonably relevant to such third-party claim, and making employees
of Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any materials
provided hereunder. The Parties shall cooperate with each other in any
notifications to insurers. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense
of such claim within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of notice of the
third-party action, suit, proceeding or claim, the Indemnified Party against
which such claim has been asserted will (upon delivering notice to such effect
to the Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake, at the Indemnifying
Party's expense (subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 6), the
defense, compromise or settlement of such claim on behalf of the Indemnifying
Party; provided, however, that such claim shall not be compromised or settled
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld. If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of the
claim, the Indemnified Party will keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably
informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement. The
Indemnifying Party shall be liable (subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article 6 and Article 7) for any settlement of any action, suit, proceeding or
claim effected pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 6.6 and for any
final judgment (subject to any right of appeal), and the Indemnifying Party
shall indemnify and hold harmless (subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article 6 and Article 7) an Indemnified Party from and against any Losses by
reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnified Party shall take any
action the purpose of which is to prejudice the defense of any claim subject to
indemnification hereunder or to induce a third party to assert a claim subject
to indemnification hereunder.

      6.7 Limitation on Obligations of the Company Stockholder Representative.
If the Company Stockholder Representative is the Indemnifying Party, (a) the
Company Stockholder Representative shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Company Stockholders severally (and not jointly) for all Losses incurred by or
on behalf of the Company Stockholder Representative pursuant to this Article 6
except where incurred as a result of the


                                      -55-
<PAGE>

Company Stockholder Representative's fraud, willful misconduct or gross
negligence and (b) if at any time the Company Stockholders fail to pay or
provide for payment of any and all Losses so incurred by the Company Stockholder
Representative, the Company Stockholder Representative shall have no further
obligation to pursue any arbitration, defend any third-party claim or otherwise
to take any action whatsoever pursuant to this Article 6. For purposes of
clarity, in no event shall the Company Stockholder Representative have any
liability or obligation to any Indemnified Party except out of, and solely to
the extent of, amounts paid by or provided for payment by the Company
Stockholders.

      6.8   Limitations on Indemnification Obligations.

            (a) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
recover for any Losses unless and until such time as the Losses in the aggregate
for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to be indemnified
hereunder, including the indemnification for Taxes set forth in Article 7,
exceed $250,000 (the "Purchaser Loss Threshold"), at which time the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover all such Losses in excess of
the amount of the Purchaser Loss Threshold. Except for those Losses which arise
out of the indemnification for Taxes under Article 7 or a breach of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 2.1 (Organization), Section
2.2 (Subsidiaries), Section 2.4 (Execution and Delivery), Section 2.6
(Capitalization), and Section 2.16 (Tax Matters) or actual fraud, in no event
shall the Losses for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to be
indemnified hereunder exceed, with respect to any Company Stockholder, an amount
equal to $6.0 million, and in any event Losses with respect to the
indemnification for Taxes under Article 7 or with respect to breaches of
Sections 2.1 (Organization), 2.2 (Subsidiaries), 2.4 (Execution and Delivery),
2.6 (Capitalization) and 2.16 (Tax Matters) of this Agreement and actual fraud
shall not exceed with respect to a Company Stockholder such Company
Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion of the Common Merger Consideration actually
received by such Company Stockholder. Each Loss for which the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties are entitled to be indemnified hereunder shall be reduced by
(i) the amount of any insurance proceeds which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
recover with respect to such Loss; (ii) any indemnity, contribution or other
similar payment which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties receive from any third
party with respect to such Loss; and (iii) an amount equal to any net Tax
Benefits of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties attributable to such Loss. The
liability of any Company Stockholder for damages under this Agreement shall be
several and not joint, and any assertion of Losses against any Company
Stockholder may only be made pro rata based on such Company Stockholder's Pro
Rata Portion and limited to the Common Merger Consideration actually received by
such Company Stockholder. If a Tax Benefit attributable to a Loss is realized by
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties after the taxable year of payment of the Loss,
Purchaser shall pay to each Company Stockholder an amount in cash equal to such
stockholder's Pro Rata Portion of the amount of such Tax Benefit.

            (b) Each Loss for which the Company Stockholder Indemnified Parties
are entitled to be indemnified hereunder shall be reduced by (i) the amount of
any insurance proceeds which the Company Stockholder Indemnified Parties recover
with respect to such Loss; and (ii) any indemnity, contribution or other similar
payment which the Company Stockholder Indemnified Parties receive from any third
party with respect to such Loss.


                                      -56-
<PAGE>

            (c) This Section 6.8 is in no way intended to affect the obligation
of Purchaser to deliver the Merger Consideration and the aggregate amount of
Credit Agreement Debt being paid by Purchaser at Closing in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

            (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the Working Capital Escrow Agreement, or
the Stockholder Representative Agreement, and in any of the agreements
contemplated hereby or thereby, the maximum aggregate liability of any Company
Stockholder to the Purchaser and Merger Sub, whether by reason of
indemnification, reimbursement or other payment obligation of any type, any
liability in tort, contract or otherwise, shall never exceed the amount of
Common Merger Consideration actually received by such Company Stockholder.

      6.9   No Duplication; Exclusive Remedy.

            (a) Any liability for indemnification hereunder and under Article 7
shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of
facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or constituting a breach of a
representation under Section 2.16 and an indemnification obligation under
Article 7. Without limiting the foregoing, amounts paid in accordance with
Section 1.13 with respect to a Working Capital Deficit shall not be subject to
duplication (e.g., in the event or to the extent that an inaccuracy in the
Company's financial statement representations gave rise to such adjustment).

            (b) From and after the Closing, the sole remedy of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties and the Company Stockholder Indemnified Parties with respect
to any breach of, or inaccuracy in, a representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement, the Company Officer's Certificate, the Company Secretary's
Certificate or any certificate delivered by Purchaser or Merger Sub at the
Closing, or any breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article 6 and
Article 7. The foregoing sentence is in no way intended to affect the obligation
of Purchaser to deliver the Merger Consideration and the aggregate amount of
Credit Agreement Debt being paid by Purchaser at Closing in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

            (c) This Section 6.9 shall not affect the rights or remedies of
third-party beneficiaries under Section 5.9 and Section 5.10; provided, however,
that such third parties shall have no rights or remedies under this Agreement
until after the Effective Time.

      6.10 No Additional Representations or Warranties. Purchaser has conducted
its own independent investigation, review and analysis of the business,
operations, properties, premises, personnel, assets, liabilities, results of
operations, financial condition, software, technology and prospects of the
Company, which investigation, review and analysis was done by Purchaser and, to
the extent Purchaser deemed appropriate, by Purchaser's representatives.
Purchaser acknowledges that it and its representatives have been provided access
to the properties, premises, personnel and records of the Company which
Purchaser deemed sufficient for such purpose. In entering into this Agreement,
Purchaser acknowledges that it has relied solely upon the aforementioned
investigation, review and analysis and not on any representations, warranties or
statements of the Company, the Company Stockholders or their


                                      -57-
<PAGE>

respective representatives, except the representations and warranties of Company
specifically set forth in Article 2 of this Agreement.

                                    ARTICLE 7
                               CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

      7.1 Tax Indemnification. The Company Stockholders, severally in accordance
with their respective Pro Rata Portions and not jointly, shall indemnify the
Surviving Company and Purchaser and hold them harmless from and against without
duplication, any Losses, claim, liability, expense, or other damage attributable
to (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and
the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Period"), (ii)
all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary
group of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of any
of the foregoing) is or was a member at or prior to the Effective Time,
including pursuant to Treas. Reg. ss. 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar
state, local, or foreign law or regulation, and (iii) any and all Taxes of any
person (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to
any law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction
occurring before the Closing; provided, however, that (A) in the case of clauses
(i), (ii), and (iii) above, the Company Stockholders shall be liable only to the
extent that such Taxes exceed the amount, if any, reserved for such Taxes
(excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) and taken into account in calculating
the Closing Working Capital pursuant to Section 1.13; and (B) the Company
Stockholders shall not be liable for any Taxes attributable to actions not in
the ordinary course of business and not contemplated by this Agreement taken by
Purchaser or the Company after the Effective Time. The Company Stockholders
shall, severally and not jointly, be liable to Purchaser for such Company
Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion of any Taxes of Company or its Subsidiaries that
are the responsibility of Company Stockholders pursuant to this Section 7.1
after determination and resolution pursuant to the procedures and subject to the
limitations set forth under Article 6. During any period in which the
Indemnification Escrow is in effect, Purchaser shall first be reimbursed for
such amounts from the Indemnification Escrow Amount, and only after exhausting
that amount, from the Company Stockholders, severally in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Portions.

      7.2 Straddle Period. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of any Taxes
based on or measured by income or receipts of Company and its Subsidiaries for
the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of
the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose,
the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which
Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed
to terminate at such time); and the amount of other Taxes of Company and its
Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in such Straddle Period.


                                      -58-
<PAGE>

      7.3 Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns. Purchaser shall in good faith
prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed all
Tax Returns for Company and its Subsidiaries relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or a Straddle Period that are filed after the Closing Date. Purchaser
shall permit the Company Stockholder Representative to review and comment on
each such Tax Return and the records and work papers used in the preparation
thereof. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the
most recent Tax Returns unless Purchaser determines that there is no reasonable
basis for such position, and shall be true, correct and complete in all material
respects. Purchaser shall make such changes to such Tax Returns as the Company
Stockholder Representative shall reasonably request (unless there is no
reasonable basis for such position), and shall not file such Tax Returns without
the Company Stockholder Representative's consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

      7.4   Cooperation on Tax Matters.

            (a) Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and
the Company Stockholder Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of
Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 7.4 and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other Party's request) the provision of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries agree (A) to retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by Company Stockholder Representative or Purchaser, any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (B) to give the other
Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding
any such books and records and, if the other Party so requests, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries or the Company Stockholder Representative, as
the case may be, shall allow the other Party to take possession of such books
and records.

            (b) Purchaser and the Company further agree, upon request, to use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from
any governmental authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited
to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

            (c) Purchaser and the Company Stockholder Representative further
agree, upon request, to provide the other Party with all information that either
Party may be required to report pursuant to Code Section 6043A or the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder.

            (d) It is understood that following the Effective Time the Company
will be a wholly owned Subsidiary of Purchaser and that as a result Purchaser
shall be liable for any breach by the Company or its Subsidiaries of their
respective obligations under this Article 7.

      7.5 Tax-Sharing Agreements. All Tax-sharing agreements or similar
agreements with respect to or involving the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
be terminated as of the Effective Time and, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder.

      7.6 Certain Taxes and Fees. Any sales or other similar Tax and any
transfer, recording or similar fee imposed on the Company with respect to the
transactions provided for in this Agreement, and any interest or penalties
related thereto, shall be shared on a 50/50 basis by the Company and by
Purchaser; provided, however, the Company shall be responsible for any Taxes
imposed on the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to a transfer of Closing
Cash occurring on or before the Closing Date contemplated by Section 8.3(n) of
this Agreement. With respect to the Company's share of such Taxes and fees, such
Taxes and fees, including any interest or penalties related thereto, shall
either be paid by the Company prior to the Closing Date or shall be accrued for
by the Company as of the Closing Date and be considered in determining the
Closing Working Capital.

      7.7 Refunds. Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
shall pay to the Company Stockholders in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Portion, in cash any amount received as a refund, rebate, credit or set-off
of Taxes for which the Company Stockholders are responsible pursuant to this
Article 7 within fifteen (15) business days of such receipt by Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation, except to the extent that such amount was taken into
account in calculating final Closing Working Capital; provided that (a)
Purchaser may offset its payment obligations under this Section 7.7 with
indemnifiable Tax Losses pursuant to Section 7.1, and (b) the obligation of
Purchaser under this Section 7.7 shall only take effect after the earlier to
occur of (i) amounts of Tax refunds, credits or set-offs so received or offset
against exceed $250,000 or (ii) Purchaser shall have made claims for Losses in
excess of the Purchaser Loss Threshold. Any such payment may, while the
Indemnification Escrow remains in existence, be deposited into the
Indemnification Escrow. Upon termination for the Indemnification Escrow (or
within such 15 business day period if the Indemnification Escrow shall have
already terminated) any such amounts shall be distributed (x) to the Company
Stockholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions.

                        TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

      9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after the Required Stockholder Vote shall have
been obtained:

            (a) by the written consent of Purchaser and the Company;

            (b) by either the Company or Purchaser if the Merger shall not have
been consummated within sixty (60) days of the date hereof for any reason;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
9.1(b) shall not be available to (i) the Company if any action or failure to act
by the Company shall have been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure
of the Merger to occur on or before such date and such action or failure to act
shall have constituted a material breach of this Agreement, or (ii) Purchaser if
any action or failure to act by Purchaser or Merger Sub shall have been a
principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or
before such date and such action or failure to act shall have constituted a
material breach of this Agreement;

            (c) by either the Company or Purchaser if a Governmental Entity
shall have issued an Order or taken any other action, in any case having the
effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
Merger, which Order or other action is final and non-appealable;

            (d) by the Company, upon a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of Purchaser or Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Purchaser or Merger Sub shall
have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Section
8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b) would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or
as of the time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue,
provided that if such breach by Purchaser or Merger Sub or such inaccuracy in
the representations and warranties of Purchaser or Merger Sub is curable by
Purchaser or Merger Sub, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under
this Section 9.1(d) until thirty (30) days after delivery of written notice to
Purchaser of such breach and intent to terminate, provided Purchaser and Merger
Sub continue to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach (it
being understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.1(d) if such breach by Purchaser or Merger Sub is cured during
such thirty (30) day period, or if the Company shall have materially breached
this Agreement); or

            (e) by Purchaser, upon a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or
if any representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, in
either case such that the conditions set forth in Section 8.3(a) or Section
8.3(b) would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time
such representation or warranty shall have become untrue in any respect,
provided that if such breach by the Company or such inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of the Company is curable by the Company, then
Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement


                                      -64-
<PAGE>

under this Section 9.1(e) until thirty (30) days after delivery of written
notice to the Company of such breach and intent to terminate, provided the
Company continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such
breach (it being understood that Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) if such breach by the Company is cured during
such thirty (30) day period, or if Purchaser shall have materially breached this
Agreement).

      9.2 Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination. Any proper termination
of this Agreement under Section 9.1 will be effective immediately upon the
delivery of written notice of termination by the terminating Party, in the case
of Purchaser, to the Company, and in the case of the Company, to Purchaser (it
being understood that, in the case of any termination pursuant to Section 9.1(d)
or Section 9.1(e) based on any breach or inaccuracy which is curable, delivery
of notice of intent to terminate pursuant to Section 9.1(d) or Section 9.1(e)
shall not be construed as notice of termination). In the event of the
termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall
be of no further force or effect, except (i) as set forth in Section 9.1, this
Section 9.2 and Sections 10.1 through 10.9, each of which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any Party
from liability for any breach of this Agreement. No termination of this
Agreement shall affect the obligations of the Parties contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, all of the obligations of which shall survive
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

      9.3 Fees and Expenses. Except to the extent otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such
expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated.

      9.4 Amendment. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, this Agreement
may be amended by the Parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company (and, as to
any amendment adversely affecting the rights and obligations of the Company
Stockholder Representative, the Company Stockholder Representative).

      9.5 Waiver; Right to Proceed. Any Party hereto may, to the extent legally
allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of
the other Parties hereto to such Party; (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such Party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto; and (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained herein. Any
agreement by a Party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party. Delay in
exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such
right.

indicated. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, such
reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed
in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The headings
contained in this Agreement are only for reference purposes and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. When reference is
made herein to "the business of" an entity, such reference shall be deemed to
include the business of all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such entity,
taken as a whole. Reference to the Subsidiaries of an entity shall be deemed to
include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such entity. Reference to an
agreement herein is to such agreement as amended in accordance with its terms up
to the date hereof. Reference to a statute herein is to such statute, as
amended. References to "dollars" or "$" mean the lawful tender of the United
States of America.

      10.3 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of
Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company, and the Company Stockholder Representative
and delivered to each of Purchaser and the Company, it being understood that all
such Parties need not sign the same counterpart.

      10.4 Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement, its
Exhibits and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the
Parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company
Disclosure Schedule, (a) constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the

Person any rights or remedies hereunder.

      10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably
to effect the intent of the Parties hereto. The Parties further agree to replace
such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and

business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

      10.6 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE

ANY ACTIONS AMONG THE PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF.

      10.7 Rules of Construction; Legal Representation. The Parties agree that
they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement, which they agree is their joint product, and therefore waive the
application of any Legal Requirement, holding or rule of construction providing
that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the
Party drafting such agreement or document. In connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that Andrews
Kurth LLP solely represented the Company, and not any of its stockholders,
employees, officers or directors.

      10.8 Assignment. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported
assignment in violation of this Section 10.8 shall be void.

      10.9 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF PURCHASER, MERGER SUB, THE COMPANY AND
THE COMPANY STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO
