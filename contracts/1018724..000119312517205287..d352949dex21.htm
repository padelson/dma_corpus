This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of June 15,
2017, is by and among Amazon.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_
"), Walnut Merger Sub, Inc., a Texas corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary
of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Whole Foods Market, Inc., a Texas

being hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Constituent Corporations_
").

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the parties intend that, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company
(the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger, pursuant to and in
accordance with the provisions of the Texas Business Organizations Code (the
" _TBOC_ ");

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent has unanimously approved and
declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Merger Sub has unanimously approved this
Agreement in accordance with the TBOC and unanimously recommended that this
Agreement be approved by the sole shareholder of Merger Sub;

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously approved this Agreement in accordance with the TBOC and

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement and to set forth certain conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

 

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company in accordance with the provisions of the TBOC and
the separate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall
be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to
as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and, following the Merger, shall be a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, and the separate existence of the Company,
with all of its rights, title and interests to all real estate and other
property owned by Merger Sub and the Company, subject to any existing liens or
other encumbrances on the property, shall continue

 



-1-  unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in this Agreement. The Merger
shall have the effects specified in this Agreement and in the TBOC.

 

1.2. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York,
New York 10004, at 9:00 a.m. (New York time) on the third Business Day (the "
_Closing Date_ ") following the day on which the last to be satisfied or
waived of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _Business Day_ " means any day ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York time)
(other than a Saturday or Sunday) on which the Department of State of the
State of Texas and banks in the County of New York, New York and in Travis
County, Texas are open for general business.

 

1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following, and on the date
of, the Closing, the Company and Parent will cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing all necessary documentation, including a Certificate of
Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), with the Secretary of State of the
State of Texas as provided in the relevant provisions of the TBOC. The Merger
shall become effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been
duly filed with and accepted by the Secretary of State of the State of Texas
or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties in writing and
specified in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

ARTICLE II

 _of the Surviving Corporation_

 

2.1. _Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation_. At the
Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in their
entirety as of the Effective Time to be in the form set forth in _Exhibit A_
to this Agreement, and as so amended shall be the articles of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ ") until thereafter amended as
provided therein or as provided by applicable Law.

 

2.2. _Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. The parties hereto shall
take all actions necessary so that the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ ") until thereafter amended as provided therein or
as provided by applicable Law.

ARTICLE III

 

 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_

 

3.1. _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The parties hereto
shall take all actions necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub at the
Effective Time shall, from and after

their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the TBOC, the
Charter and the Bylaws.

3.2. _Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The parties hereto
shall take all actions necessary so that the officers of the Company at the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of

in accordance with the TBOC, the Charter and the Bylaws.

 

ARTICLE IV

_Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_

_Exchange of Share Certificates_

 

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital
stock of the Company:

 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third
parties, (ii) Shares that are owned by shareholders of the Company who have
complied with the applicable provisions of Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the
TBOC prior to the Effective Time (the Shares referred to in clause (ii), "
_Dissenting Shares_ ," and the Shares referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), "
_Excluded Shares_ ") and (iii) the Company Restricted Share Awards (which
shall be converted pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4.3(b)_)) shall be converted
into the right to receive $42.00 per Share in cash, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 4.1(a)_ shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate formerly
representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) (each, a " _Share
Certificate_ ") and each book-entry account formerly representing any non-
certificated Shares (other than Excluded Shares) (each, a " _Book-Entry
Share_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Dissenting Shares_. Each Dissenting Share shall,
as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of
such Dissenting Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment
of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights
the holder thereof may have pursuant to _Section 4.2(g)_ and the TBOC.

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

4.2. _Exchange of Share Certificates and Book Entry Shares_.

 



-3- (a) _Appointment of Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent and Merger Sub shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to serve as the paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_
") and shall enter into an agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company
relating to the Paying Agents responsibilities with respect to this
Agreement.

 

(b) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent, cash in U.S. Dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration (other than in respect of Excluded Shares) under _Section
4.1(a)_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ ").
The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than a purpose
expressly provided for in this Agreement. Pending its disbursement in
accordance with this  _Section 4.2_, the Payment Fund shall be invested by
the Paying Agent, if so directed by Parent or Merger Sub. Any such investment,
if made, must be made in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United
States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and
credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment
of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest
quality by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements
or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion.
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is
at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make all
payments of Merger Consideration in accordance herewith. No investment losses
resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall
diminish the rights of any holder of Shares to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided herein. Payments to holders in respect of Company
Options, Company Restricted Share Awards, Company RSU Awards and Company SARs
shall be paid through the Companys or the Surviving Corporations applicable
payroll procedures following the Effective Time at such time as such awards
are payable.

(c) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three
Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
(A) a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, (B) a
letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of the Share Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Share Certificates as provided in _Section_
__ _ 4.2(f)_) or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent
(including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents
message" with respect to Book-Entry Shares), such materials to be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent desires with approval of the Company
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "), and (C) instructions for effecting the surrender
of the Share Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Share
Certificates as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_) or the Book-Entry Shares
to the Paying Agent in exchange for payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

 



-4- (ii) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Share Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Share Certificates as provided in _Section_
__ _ 4.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares, together with, in the case of Share
Certificates, the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares held through The Depositary Trust Company, receipt of an "agents
message" by the Paying Agent, and such other documents as may be reasonably
required, the holder of such Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Paying Agent shall be
required to deliver to each such holder, a check in the amount (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _
4.2(h)_) of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 4.1(a)_.

 

(iii) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon
surrender of any Shares. 

(iv) In the event of a transfer of ownership of certificated Shares
(other than Excluded Shares) that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the
Share Certificates may be issued to such transferee if the Share Certificates
formerly representing such Shares are presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid or are not applicable, in each case, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Paying Agent. Payment of the Merger Consideration with
respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name
such Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books of the
Company.

 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Payment Fund) that remains
unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Share Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares by the one year anniversary of the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this _Article IV_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 4.2(h))_ upon delivery of the Share Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Share Certificates as provided in _Section
4.2(f))_ or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. To the fullest extent
permitted by Law, immediately prior to the date any Merger Consideration would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority,
such Merger Consideration shall become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ "
means any individual, corporation (including

 



-5-  not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company,
joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental
Authority or other entity of any kind or nature.

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Share Certificates_. In the event any
Share Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Share Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond sufficient to indemnify Parent and the Surviving Corporation
against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Share Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Share Certificate a check in the
amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section 4.2(h))_ equal to the number of Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Share Certificate multiplied by
the Merger Consideration.

(g) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration and holders of such Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled to receive payments in accordance with the
provisions of Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the TBOC, unless and until such
Person fails to comply with the provisions of Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the
TBOC or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such Persons rights to
receive payment under Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the TBOC. If any such
Person fails to comply with the provisions of Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the
TBOC or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares
shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted at the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall
give Parent notice of any written demands for appraisal of Shares promptly
after receipt by the Company, and shall give Parent the opportunity to devise
and implement strategy for, and participate in, all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, schedule any meeting or make any
payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal or offer to settle or
settle any such demands.

 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable federal, state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
timely remitted by Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Authority,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

4.3. _Treatment of Stock-Based Awards; ESPP_. 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding option to purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") granted under
the Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, fully vest and shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive (without interest), as soon
as

 



-6-  reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal
to the product of (i) the number of Shares subject to the Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time  _multiplied by_ (ii) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Merger Consideration _over_ (B) the exercise price per Share
of such Company Option. Any Company Option that has an exercise price per
Share that is greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration shall be
cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment.

 

(b) _Treatment of Company Restricted Share Awards_. At the Effective
Time, each outstanding restricted stock award (a " _Company Restricted Share
Award_ ") granted under the Stock Plan, shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, fully vest and shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive (without interest), as soon
as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, an amount in cash
equal to (i) the number of Shares subject to such Company Restricted Share
Award _multiplied by_  (ii) the Merger Consideration.

(c) _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards_. At the
Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award (a " _Company RSU
Award_ ") granted under the Stock Plan, shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, fully vest and shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive (without interest), as soon
as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, an amount in cash
equal to (i) the number of Shares subject to such Company RSU Award 
_multiplied by_ (ii) the Merger Consideration; _provided_ , that, with respect
to any Company RSU Awards that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be paid at
the Effective Time without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of
the Code, such payment shall be made at the earliest time permitted under the
Stock Plan and applicable award agreement that will not trigger a Tax or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

(d) _Treatment of Company Stock Appreciation Rights_. At the
Effective Time, each outstanding cash-settled stock appreciation right in
respect of Shares (a " _Company SAR_ "), whether vested or unvested, shall,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, fully
vest and shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (without
interest), as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, an
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares subject to
the Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (ii)
the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration _over_ (B) the exercise
price per Share of such Company SAR. Any Company SAR that has an
exercise price per Share that is greater than or equal to the Merger
Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or
payment.

 

(e) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement and in any event prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take all actions (including obtaining any necessary
determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a duly authorized
committee thereof and, if appropriate, amending the terms of the Companys
2007 Team Member Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ")) that may be necessary
or required under the ESPP and applicable Laws to ensure that (A) except for
the three-month offering period under the ESPP that commenced on April 1,
2017 (the " _Final Offering_ "), no offering period shall be authorized or
commenced on or after the date of this

 



-7-  Agreement, (B) the Final Offering shall end on a date no later than the
Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the later of the date the
Final Offering ends and the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, the " _ESPP Termination Date_ "), (C) each ESPP participants
accumulated contributions under the ESPP shall be used to purchase Shares in
accordance with the ESPP as of the end of the Final Offering, with any
remaining contributions returned to the participant (without interest) as soon
as administratively practicable thereafter, (D) the applicable purchase price
for Shares shall not be decreased below the levels set forth in the ESPP as
of the date of this Agreement and (E) the ESPP shall terminate in its entirety
upon the ESPP Termination Date and no further rights shall be granted or
exercised under the ESPP thereafter other than in accordance with the
preceding clause (C).

(f) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the
Company, the Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company
Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that
are necessary to (i) effectuate the treatment of the Company Options,
Company Restricted Share Awards, Company RSU Awards, Company SARs and the
ESPP pursuant to _Sections_ __ _ 4.3(a)_ through _Section_ __ _ 4.3(e)_ and
(ii) cause the Stock Plan to terminate at or prior to the Effective Time,
subject to Parents obligations under this _Section 4.3_. The Company shall
take all actions necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver
Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in
settlement of Company Options, Company Restricted Share Awards, Company RSU
Awards or Company SARs. The Surviving Corporation shall, subject to 
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(h)_, pay through its payroll systems the amounts due
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.3(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.3(b)_, _Section_ __ _
4.3(c)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 4.3(d)_.

(g) _Future Grants of Equity Awards_. Notwithstanding anything in
_Section 4.3(a)_, _Section 4.3(b)_, and _Section 4.3(c)_ to the contrary,
but subject to Section 6.1, to the extent the terms of any Company Option,
Company Restricted Share Award or Company RSU Award granted on or after the
date of this Agreement and not in violation of this Agreement expressly
provide for treatment in connection with the occurrence of the Effective Time
that is different from the treatment prescribed by  _Section 4.3(a)_,
_Section 4.3(b)_ and _Section 4.3(c)_, the terms of such Company Option,
Company Restricted Share Award or Company RSU Award shall control (and
_Section 4.3(a)_, _Section 4.3(b)_ and _Section 4.3(c)_ shall not apply).

4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement to the

Outside Date. The Company has made available to Parent prior to the date of
this Agreement true, correct and complete copies of the Companys and its

(i) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely
basis, all forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required

severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date of this
Agreement, (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any
material payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of

any such communication.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give
Parent, its Subsidiaries, or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control,
supervision, and decisionmaking authority over its and its Subsidiaries

6.2. _Acquisition Proposals; Change of Recommendation_.

 

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Except as expressly permitted by
this  _Section 6.2_, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and the directors and officers

 



-39-  of it and its Subsidiaries not to, and shall instruct and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives (such directors,
officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors or representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to,
directly or indirectly:

 

(i) initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate any inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or offer that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal;

 

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations relating to any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry,
proposal, indication of interest or offer that would reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal (other than to state the extent to which the
terms of this provision prohibit such discussions);

(iii) provide any non-public information to any Person in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; or

 

(iv) subject to this _Section_ __ 6.2, waive, terminate, modify or
fail to enforce any "standstill" or confidentiality obligation of any Person
(other than any party hereto) with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries entered into in connection with an Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.2(a), prior
to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, in
response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal not solicited in
violation of this Section 6.2, the Company may:

 

(i) provide information in response to a request therefor (including
non-public information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to
the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that in the event
such information has not previously been made available to Parent, the
Company shall, promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours), provide such
information to Parent and that, prior to furnishing any such information, the
Company receives from the Person making such Acquisition Proposal an
executed confidentiality agreement with terms not less restrictive in the
aggregate to the other party than the terms in the Confidentiality Agreement
are on Parent at such time; _provided_ , that the Company shall not enter into
any Confidentiality Agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent
in accordance with this _Section 6.2_ or otherwise prohibits the Company from
complying with its obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Company shall not provide information to any Person pursuant to any
confidentiality agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
unless such Person agrees prior to receipt of such information to waive any
provision that would prohibit the Company from providing any information to
Parent in accordance with this _Section 6.2_ or otherwise prohibit the
Company from complying with its obligations under this Agreement; and

 



-40- (ii) engage in or participate in discussions and/or negotiations with
any such Person regarding such Acquisition Proposal;

in each case, if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in
clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Company Board determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel that, (A) based on the information
then available and after consultation with its outside financial advisors,
such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal or a transaction that
did not result from a breach of the Companys obligations set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ that is more favorable to the Companys shareholders from
a financial point of view than the Merger that could reasonably be expected to
satisfy the criteria in clause (B) of the definition of "Superior Proposal"
and (B), in each such case, the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours)
give written notice to Parent if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
receives (i) any inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or offer with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request by any Person or group
for information in connection with or with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, or (iii) any request by any Person or group for discussions or
negotiations, or to initiate or continue discussions or negotiations, with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, setting forth in such notice the name of
such Person or group and the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposals (including, if applicable, complete copies of any
written request, inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or offer, including
proposed agreements and any other written communications) and thereafter
shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis (and, in
any event, within 24 hours), of changes in the status and terms of any such
proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and any changes to the
status of any such discussions or negotiations.

 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal, indication of interest or offer
involving any Person or group (other than Parent or its Subsidiaries)
relating to (i) a merger, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender
offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business combination
or similar transaction involving the Company, (ii) any acquisition by any
Person or group resulting in, or any proposal, indication of interest or offer
that, if consummated, would result in any Person or group becoming the
beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of
related transactions, 15% or more of the total voting power or of any class
of equity securities of the Company or assets representing 15% or more of the
consolidated net revenues, net income or total assets (including equity
securities of any of the Companys Subsidiaries and equity securities of any
other entity) of the Company or (iii) any combination of the foregoing, in
each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
did not result from a breach of the Companys obligations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ and that would result in any Person or group becoming the
beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the total voting
power of any class of equity securities of the Company or assets

 



-41-  representing more than 50% of the consolidated net revenues, net income or
total assets (including equity securities of the Companys Subsidiaries and
equity securities of any other entity) of the Company, that the Company Board
has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and its outside financial advisor, taking into account all legal,
financial, financing and regulatory aspects of the Acquisition Proposal, the
identity of the Person(s) making the proposal and the likelihood of the
proposal being consummated in accordance with its terms and all other matters
that the Company Board considers appropriate, that, if consummated, would
result in a transaction (A) more favorable to the Companys shareholders from
a financial point of view than the Merger and (B) that is reasonably likely to
be completed, taking into account any regulatory, financing or approval
requirements and any other aspects considered relevant by the Company Board
(after taking into account any binding revisions to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.2(f)_).

 

(e) _No Change of Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.
Except as permitted by  _Section 6.2(f)_ and _Section 6.2(g)_, the Company
Board, including any committee thereof, shall not:

 

(i) withdraw or fail to make when required by this Agreement (or
publicly propose or publicly resolve to withdraw or fail to make when
required by this Agreement) the Company Recommendation with respect to the
Merger;

 

(ii) qualify or modify (or publicly propose or publicly resolve to
qualify or modify) the Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger in a
manner adverse to Parent;

 

(iii) approve or recommend, or publicly declare advisable, any
Acquisition Proposal;

 

(iv) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement;

 

(v) if any Acquisition Proposal that is structured as a tender offer or
exchange offer for outstanding Shares is commenced pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of
the Exchange Act, fail to recommend against acceptance of such offer by the
Companys shareholders prior to the earlier of (A) the date of the Company
Shareholders Meeting and (B) 11 business days (which for this purpose shall be
used as such term is used in Rule 14d-9 of the Exchange Act) after
commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of
the Exchange Act;

 

(vi) approve or recommend, or publicly declare advisable or publicly
propose to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, collaboration
agreement or other agreement with respect to, or that is intended or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)(_ _i_ _)_
relating to any Acquisition Proposal) (an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ ," and any of the actions set forth in the foregoing clauses (i)
through (vi), a " _Change of Recommendation_ "); or

 



-42- (vii) cause or permit the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, the Company Board may effect a Change of Recommendation and, in the
case of a Change of Recommendation relating to a Superior Proposal and after
complying with the provisions of this _Section 6.2(f)_, terminate the
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_, if the Company Board has determined
in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that (x) in the case where the Change of
Recommendation is not made in response to an Acquisition Proposal that could
constitute a Superior Proposal, an Intervening Event has occurred and the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (y) in the case where such Change
of Recommendation is made in response to an Acquisition Proposal that could
constitute a Superior Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal and the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that
the Company Board shall not take any action set forth above unless and
until (1) the Company has given Parent written notice of its intention to
take such action five Business Days in advance, which notice shall comply with
the provisions of _Section 6.2(c)_ (if applicable), setting forth in writing
that management of the Company or a committee of the Company Board intends to
recommend to the Company Board that it take such action; (2) after giving such
notice and prior to taking such action, the Company has afforded Parent the
opportunity to negotiate in good faith with the Company (to the extent Parent
wishes to negotiate) to enable Parent to propose in writing a binding offer to
make such revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause
such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal (or, in
the case of a Change of Recommendation not involving an Acquisition Proposal,
such that the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would not be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law); and
(3) at the end of the five Business Day period and prior to taking any such
action, the Company Board has considered in good faith any such binding
written offer to make revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent and any other information it deems appropriate, and has determined in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its outside
financial advisors, that in the case of a Superior Proposal, the
Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (or, in the
case of a Change of Recommendation not involving an Acquisition Proposal, that
the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would still be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law) if such changes
proposed in such binding offer by Parent were to be given effect. In the event
of any modification to the financial terms or any other material terms of any
Acquisition Proposal, the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence shall
apply again, except that the five Business Day period shall instead be two
Business Days.

 

" _Intervening Event_ " means a change, effect, event, circumstance or
development that was not known by the Company or the Company Board as of the
date of this Agreement; _provided_ , that in no event shall any of the
following constitute or be deemed to be an Intervening Event: (i) the receipt,
existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal that could constitute a
Superior Proposal or any matter relating thereto or (ii) changes in the stock
price of the Company (it being understood, however, that any underlying cause
thereof may be taken into account for purposes of determining whether
an Intervening Event has occurred; _provided_ , _further_ , that an

 



-43- Acquisition Proposal that resulted from a breach of the Companys obligations
set forth in this Section 6.2 may not be the basis for an Intervening Event).

(g) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company, the Company Board or any committee of the Company
Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to the shareholders of the Company that is required by applicable
Law; it being understood that a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act shall not be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation; _provided_ , that
any such disclosure that has the substantive effect of withdrawing, modifying
or qualifying in any manner adverse to the Company Recommendation shall be
deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to be a Change of Recommendation
unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company
Recommendation in such communication without any qualification.

(h) _Existing Discussions_. The Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and financial advisors and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its other Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or proposal or
transaction that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall within 24 hours after execution of this Agreement
deliver a written notice to each such Person providing only that the Company
is ending all discussions and negotiations with such Person with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal or proposal or transaction that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall also
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
concerning the Company and any of its Subsidiaries. The Company will
immediately terminate all physical and electronic data access previously
granted to such Persons.

 

(i) _Limits on Release of Standstill and Confidentiality_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall be permitted to terminate, amend, modify, waive or fail to
enforce any provision of any such confidentiality, "standstill" or similar
obligation of any Person if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 

(j) _Applicable Law_. For purposes of this Section 6.2, the parties
agree that, as between themselves, Texas law relating to the fiduciary duties
of directors shall be deemed to be the same as Delaware law.

 

6.3. _Proxy Statement Filing; Information Supplied_.

 

(a) The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, a proxy statement in
preliminary form relating to the Company Shareholders Meeting (such proxy
statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Proxy
Statement_ "). The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all
comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request

 



-44-  by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional
information and shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence
between the Company and/or any of its Representatives and the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments
received on the Proxy Statement from the SEC, and the Company shall cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of the Company as
promptly as practicable after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no
further comments thereon and that the Company may commence mailing the
Proxy Statement. The Company agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that
the Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Parent agrees that none of the information supplied by it for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement will, at the date of mailing to shareholders of the
Company or at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

(b) The Company shall provide legal counsel to Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on drafts of the Proxy Statement prior to
filing such documents with the applicable Governmental Authority and mailing
such documents to the Companys shareholders. The Company shall consider in
good faith all comments reasonably proposed by Parent or its legal counsel
and agrees that all information relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries
included in the Proxy Statement shall be in form and content reasonably
satisfactory to Parent.

 

6.4. _Company Shareholders Meeting_.

 

(a) The Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its
articles of incorporation and bylaws, all action necessary to convene a
meeting of the holders of Shares (the " _Company Shareholders Meeting_ ") as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date the SEC staff advises that
it has no further comments thereon and that the Company may commence mailing
the Proxy Statement, to consider and vote upon the approval of this Agreement
and to cause such vote to be taken, and shall not postpone or adjourn such
meeting, except to the extent advised by counsel to be necessary to comply
with Law or pursuant to the following sentence. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the Company may adjourn, recess, or
postpone, and at the request of Parent it shall adjourn, recess or
postpone, the Company Shareholders Meeting for a reasonable period to solicit
additional proxies, if the Company or Parent, respectively, reasonably
believes there will be insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Shareholders Meeting or to obtain the Requisite Company Vote (
_provided_ that, unless agreed in writing by the Company and Parent, all such
adjournments, recesses or postponements shall be for periods of no more than
10 Business Days each) and (ii) the Company may adjourn, recess, or postpone
the Company Shareholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
shareholders of the Company for the amount of time required by Law in advance
of the Company Shareholders Meeting. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.2(f)_, the
Company Board shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement
and shall take all lawful action to obtain the Requisite Company Vote.

 



-45- (b) The Company agrees (i) to provide Parent with the written voting
reports it receives concerning proxy solicitation results on a timely basis
and (ii) to use its reasonable best efforts to give written notice to Parent
one Business Day prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting and on the day of,
but prior to, the Company Shareholders Meeting of the status of the Requisite
Company Vote.

 

6.5. _Cooperation; Antitrust Matters; Status_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, including _Section_ __ 6.2,
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts
to: (i) consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later
than the Outside Date); (ii) obtain from any Governmental Authority any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, clearances or
orders that are necessary, proper or advisable to be obtained by Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in order to consummate the

reversed; (v) as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within
10 Business Days after the date of this Agreement (unless otherwise agreed by

(b) The parties shall give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to give) any notices to third parties, and shall use, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to obtain any third
party consents that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the parties shall coordinate and cooperate in determining whether any actions,
consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any
Contracts of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and seeking
any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

 

(c) The parties shall reasonably cooperate in the preparation, execution
and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property Taxes, as well as any transfer, gains, sales, use,
recording, registration and any similar Taxes that

 



-46-  become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the parties shall reasonably cooperate in minimizing the amount
of such Taxes.

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this

Authority regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv)
promptly notify the other parties of the substance of any communication from

for obtaining any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in connection
with the Merger; _provided_ , that such strategy shall be designed to obtain
such clearances as promptly as reasonably practicable but in no event later
than the Outside Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent and the Company
shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith
the views of the other in connection with, all of the information relating
to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted or communications made to, any third party and/or any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by
any applicable Law each party hereto will permit authorized representatives of

and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document,
opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Authority in
connection with such request or proceeding.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, nothing
contained herein shall require, or be construed to require, (i) Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries to take or refrain from taking any action (including any
divestiture, holding separate any business or assets or other similar action)

require either the Company or Parent to permit any access to any of its
officers, employees, agents, contracts, books or records, or its stores,
offices, distribution facilities or other facilities, or to permit any

the disclosure of such information without such impediments. Each of Parent
and the Company, as it deems advisable and necessary, may reasonably
designate competitively sensitive material provided to the other as "Outside
Counsel Only Material" or with similar restrictions. Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of
the recipient, or otherwise as the restriction indicates, and be subject to
any additional confidentiality or joint defense agreement between the parties.
All requests for information made pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_

understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall
not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its
continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such information that is entitled
to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or
other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under
these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.

policies, in each case providing only for Side A coverage for indemnified
parties where the existing policies also include Side B coverage for the
Company for a claims reporting or discovery period of six years from and after

with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or
actions contemplated hereby). If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for
any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective

Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for the Tail Period the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with terms, conditions,

rights that any such DandO Indemnitee may have under the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Contract or applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO
Indemnitee without the consent of such DandO Indemnitee.

conditioned. Each of Parent and the Company shall notify the other promptly
of the commencement of any shareholder litigation of which it has received
notice.

(v) could reasonably be expected to cause any director, officer or employee

(vi) could reasonably be expected to conflict with the organizational
documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any Laws;

under, any contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party;

 

(viii) provide access to or disclose information that the Company or any of

-57- (xi) prepare any projections or pro forma financial statements; or

(xii) deliver or cause to be delivered any opinion of counsel in connection

Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.16_ or otherwise shall
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be
an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing.

 

(d) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any
and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred in connection with the Debt Financing, the Notes
Assumption, or the Debt Payoff, or otherwise in connection with any and all of
the matters contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.16_ (other than arising
from fraud on the part of the Company or its Subsidiaries), whether or not
the Merger is consummated or this Agreement is terminated. Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys fees)
incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the Debt

the sole obligation of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement
of any financing (including the Debt Financing) to be obtained by Parent or
Merger Sub with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
no other provision of this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto) shall be deemed to expand or modify such obligations. In no event
shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing) by Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates or any other financing or other transactions be a
condition to any of Parents or Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII

_Termination_  

8.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Merger shall not have
been consummated by February 15, 2018 (the " _Outside Date_ "), _provided_ ,
that if the Closing shall not have occurred prior to such date and all the
conditions to Closing, other than the conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _
7.1(b)_ or _7.1(c)_ (as it relates to the HSR Act or any Antitrust Law), shall
have been satisfied or shall be capable of being satisfied at such time, the
Outside Date may be extended on one occasion by either Parent or the Company
for a period of 90 days by written notice to the other party, and such date,
as so extended, shall be the Outside Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_
shall not be available to any party that has breached in any material respect
its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have caused the
failure of a condition to the consummation of the Merger;

(c) by either Parent or the Company, if the Requisite Company Vote
shall not have been obtained if a vote shall have been taken thereon at the
Company Shareholders Meeting (and the meeting shall have concluded);

 



-60- (d) by either Parent or the Company, if any Order permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger
shall become final and non-appealable;

 

(e) by Parent, if there has been a breach by the Company of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement,
or if any representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue,
in either case such that any condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_
or  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ would not be satisfied (and such breach or
failure to be true and correct is not curable prior to the Outside Date, or if
curable prior to the Outside Date, has not been cured within the earlier of
(i) 30 days after the giving of notice thereof by Parent to the Company or
(ii) three Business Days prior to the Outside Date);

 

(f) by the Company, if there has been a breach by Parent or Merger Sub
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub shall
have become untrue, in either case such that any condition set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ would not be satisfied
(and such breach or failure to be true and correct is not curable prior to the
Outside Date, or if curable prior to the Outside Date, has not been cured
within the earlier of (i) 30 days after the giving of notice thereof by the
non-breaching party to the breaching party or (ii) three Business Days prior

(g) by Parent, prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is

or (ii) at any time following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that has not
been withdrawn, the Company Board failed to reaffirm its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger within 10 Business Days after
receipt of any written request to do so from Parent; _provided_ , that Parent
may not provide such a written request more than once for each Acquisition
Proposal; or

 

(h) by the Company, prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, in connection with entering into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement providing for a Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section_ __ _
6.2(f)_; _provided_ , that prior to or concurrently with such termination, the
Company pays the Company Termination Fee due.

8.2. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment._

 

(a) Except to the extent provided in _Sections_ __ _ 8.2(b)_, _8.2(c)_
,  _8.2(d)_ and _8.2(e)_ , in the event of termination of this Agreement and
the abandonment of the Merger in accordance with _Section 8.1_, this
Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability to any Person
on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives or
Affiliates); _provided_ , that (x) no such termination shall relieve any party
hereto of any liability or damages to the other party hereto resulting from
any willful and material breach of its obligations set forth in this
Agreement and (y) the provisions set forth in this _Section 8.2,_ _Section
6.16(d)_ and the second and third sentences of _Section 9.1_ shall survive
the termination of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, " _willful
and material breach_ " means a material breach of this Agreement that is a
consequence of an act undertaken or a failure to take an act by the
breaching party with the knowledge that the taking of such act or the failure
to take such act would cause a material breach of this Agreement.

 



-61- (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

(i) by (I) either the Company or Parent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
8.1(c)_ ( _Requisite Company Vote Not Obtained_ ) or (II) Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(e)_ ( _Company Breach_ ) as a result of a material breach by the
Company of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement and, at
the time of such termination, the Requisite Company Vote shall not have been
obtained; and

 

(A) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been made publicly to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise become publicly known, or any
Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional)
to make an Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn without
qualification prior to, in the case of clause (I), the earlier of (x) five
days prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting (as such meeting may have been
adjourned or postponed in accordance with this Agreement) or (y) termination
of this Agreement; and

 

(B) within 12 months after such termination, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall have entered into a definitive agreement providing for, or
shall have consummated or, in the case of an Acquisition Proposal that is a
tender offer, shall have approved or recommended to the Companys
shareholders, an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that, for purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(_ _i_ _)_ , the references to "15%" in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%"
and, as to clause (i) of such definition, any such Acquisition Proposal shall
result in a change in control of at least 50% of the stock or assets of the
Company;

 

(ii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ ( _Company Recommendation
Matters_ ); or

(iii) by the Company pursuant to  _Section 8.1(h)_ ( _Superior
Proposal_ );

then, (1) in the case of _Section 8.2(b)(i)_, within two Business Days
after consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, (2) in the case of _Section
8.2(b)(ii)_, within two Business Days after termination of this Agreement and
(3) in the case of _Section 8.2(b)(iii)_, concurrently with or prior to
termination of this Agreement, the Company shall pay a termination fee of
$400,000,000 (the " _Company_ _Termination Fee_ ") (net of any Expense
Reimbursement previously paid) to Parent by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent. In the event
that this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ ( _Requisite Company Vote Not Obtained_ ), the
Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated in writing by Parent, all of the reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses, including those of the Paying Agent,
incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in an amount not to exceed
$25,000,000 (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ "), within two Business Days after
the date following such termination. To the extent any portion of the Expense
Reimbursement is paid by the Company to Parent, such amount paid shall be
deducted from the amount of any Company Termination Fee owed or payable.

 



-62- (c) Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, no party would have entered
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay Parent
any amount due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_ (any such amount due, a "
_Termination Payment_ "), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
applicable Termination Payment, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest thereon at the prime rate as published in _The Wall
Street Journal_ (or if not reported therein, as reported in another
authoritative source reasonably selected by Parent) in effect on the date such
Termination Payment was required to be paid from such date through the date of
full payment thereof;  _provided_ , that if such suit does not result in a
judgment against the Company, Parent shall pay to the Company its costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit.

 

(d) Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the Company
Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the
circumstances in which such Company Termination Fee is due and payable and
which do not involve fraud or willful and material breach, for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities forgone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (x) in no event
shall more than one Company Termination Fee be payable under this Agreement
and (y) the parties agree that the payment of the Company Termination Fee
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub with
respect to this Agreement in the event any such payment becomes due and
payable and is paid, and, upon payment of the Company Termination Fee, the
Company (and the Companys Affiliates and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, stockholders and Representatives) shall have no further
liability to Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement;  _provided_ , that
in the event that a Company Termination Fee becomes due and is paid pursuant
to this _Section 8.2_, Parent shall have the right to refund the Company
Termination Fee in its entirety within five Business Days after the payment
of the Company Termination Fee by the Company, and if Parent does so refund
the Company Termination Fee in its entirety to the Company within such five
Business Day period, the Company shall not be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its willful and material breach of this
Agreement and Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to all remedies
available as contemplated by _Section 8.2(a)_. If Parent fails to exercise
its right to refund the Company Termination Fee in accordance with the
proviso set forth in the previous sentence, Parent and Merger Sub shall be
deemed to have irrevocably waived any and all rights and remedies other than
receipt of the Company Termination Fee and the Company and its
Representatives shall have no further liability to Parent and Merger Sub under
this Agreement. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the Company
Termination Fee, if paid to Parent, shall be treated as liquidated
damages that are capital in nature to which Section 1234A of the Code
applies.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of
the Financing Sources shall have any liability to the Company or any Person
that is an Affiliate of the Company relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Debt Financing, whether at law,

 



-63-  or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Company nor
any Person that is an Affiliate of the Company shall have any rights or claims
against any Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Financing Sources_ " means any agent, arranger, lender
or other entity that has committed to provide or arrange, or has entered into
definitive agreements related to, the Debt Financing, or any of such Persons
Affiliates or its or their respective officers, directors, employees,
partners, trustees, shareholders, controlling persons, agents,
representatives, successors or assigns.

9.5. _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial; Specific
Performance._

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware
or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware, except (x) as otherwise
required under the Laws of the State of Texas and (y) all matters relating to
the interpretation, construction, validity and enforcement (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise) against any of the Financing
Sources in any way relating to the Debt Financing, shall be exclusively
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the domestic Law of the State
of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision
or rule whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction that would
cause the application of Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New
York. In addition, each of the parties (a) agrees that it shall not bring
any claim, action or proceeding against any other parties hereto relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than
(i) the Delaware Court of Chancery in and for New Castle County, (ii) in the
event (but only in the event) that such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such suit, action or other proceeding, the Delaware Superior
Court, (iii) in the event (but only in the event) such courts identified in
clauses (i) or (ii) do not have subject matter jurisdiction over such suit,
action or other proceeding, the United States District Court for the District
of Delaware or (iv) in the event (but only in the event) such courts
identified in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) do not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such suit, action or other proceeding, any other Delaware
state court (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), in the event any dispute between the
parties hereto (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arises out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) expressly submits to
the personal jurisdiction and venue of the Chosen Courts, and (c) expressly
waives any claim of lack of personal jurisdiction or improper venue and any
claims that such courts are an inconvenient forum with respect to such a
claim. Each party hereby irrevocably consents to the service of process of any
of the aforementioned courts in any such suit, action or proceeding by the
mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail or by overnight
courier service, postage prepaid, to its address set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.6_, such service to become effective 10 days after such
mailing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
(including this _Section_ __ _ 9.5_), each party agrees that it will not
bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way
relating to this Agreement or the Debt Financing, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom). EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM, ACTION OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY (i) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY

WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (ii) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT,
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
9.5_.

 

(b) Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees that
the rights of each party to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are special, unique and of extraordinary
character and that if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement
are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise
breached, immediate and irreparable harm or damage would be caused for which
money damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees
that, in addition to any other available remedies a party may have in equity
or at law, each party shall be entitled to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and to obtain an injunction restraining any
breach or violation or threatened breach or violation of the provisions of
this Agreement without necessity of posting a bond or other form of security.
In the event that any action or proceeding should be brought in equity to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege or assert, and
each party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at
law.

is defined in the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

 

9.12. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

 

9.13. _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of
reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a
reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or

 



-68-  Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

 

(b) If a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a noun), it
shall have a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech (such
as a verb). Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise,
words importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neutral
genders and vice versa, and the definitions of terms contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such
terms. The words "includes" or "including" shall mean "including without
limitation," the words "hereof," "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and similar
terms in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any
particular section or article in which such words appear, the word "extent" in
the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other
thing extends and such phrase shall not mean simply "if," any reference to a
Law shall include any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and
any reference to any Law in this Agreement shall mean such Law as from time
to time amended, modified or supplemented. Currency amounts referenced herein
are in U.S. Dollars. Each reference to a "wholly-owned Subsidiary" or "wholly-
owned Subsidiaries" of a Person shall be deemed to include any Subsidiary of
such Person where all of the equity interests of such Subsidiary are directly
or indirectly owned by such Person (other than directors qualifying shares,
nominee shares or other equity interests that are required by law or
regulation to be held by a director or nominee). The terms "provided to" or
"made available to," with respect to documents required to be provided by the
Company to Parent or Merger Sub, include documents filed or furnished by the
Company with the SEC as an exhibit after September 26, 2016 and prior to the
date of this Agreement.

 

(c) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting
this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

9.14. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign
any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, by
operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other
parties, except that Merger Sub may assign any and all of its rights under
this Agreement, by written notice to the Company, to another wholly-
owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent to be a Constituent Corporation
in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references to Merger Sub in this
Agreement shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary, except that all
representations and warranties made in this Agreement with respect to Merger
Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and
warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such
designation; _provided_ that (a) no assignment shall be permitted if such
assignment would, or would reasonably be expected to, prevent or materially
delay Parent or Merger Sub from performing their respective obligations under
this Agreement or consummating the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) no assignment shall relieve Parent of
any of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Any purported assignment in
violation of this Agreement is void.
