 (c) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, except in the case of fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentation, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree (on behalf of themselves and their respective Affiliates) that (i) if the Asset Purchase is consummated, the indemnification provisions in this _Article VII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties hereto and their respective Affiliates for any and all claims against them for Indemnifiable Damages for the 

   ##### 

  

   

matters listed in _Sections 7.1(a), 7.1(b), 7.2(a) and 7.2(b)_, (ii) all

all rights they may have to make claims against each other under statutory
and common law as a result of any Indemnifiable Damages, whether or not in
excess of the maximum amounts permitted to be recovered pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth herein. 

   

 (d) The amount of any Indemnifiable Damages that are subject to indemnification under this  _Article VII_ shall be calculated net of the amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments or contribution payments actually received by the Buyer Indemnitee or the Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be. 

   

 7.4 _Period for Claims_. The period during which claims for Indemnifiable Damages may be made pursuant to either _Section 7.1(a)_ or _Section 7.2(a)_ (the " _Claims Period_ ") shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, except with respect to claims relating to Special Matters, as to which the Claims Period shall terminate thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations; _provided_ , that if at the stated expiration of any Claims Period there shall then be pending any indemnification claim by an Indemnitee, such Indemnitee shall continue to have the right to such indemnification with respect to such claim notwithstanding such expiration. 

  

 7.5 _Claims_. 

  

 (a) As promptly as practicable after becoming aware of facts that constitute, or are reasonably likely to constitute, Indemnifiable Damages, an Indemnitee shall deliver to the other party from whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnitor_ ") a certificate signed by any officer of Indemnitee (the " _Officer s Certificate_"): 

   

 (i) stating that an Indemnitee has incurred or paid, or is reasonably likely to incur or pay, Indemnifiable Damages; 

  

 (ii) a reasonable good faith estimate of the amount of such Indemnifiable Damages; 

  

 (iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then possessed by the Indemnitee) the individual items of such Indemnifiable Damages included in the amount so stated and the nature of the claim to which such Indemnifiable Damages are related; and 

  

 (iv) attaching any reasonable supporting documentation received by such Indemnitee in connection therewith. 

  

 (b) If the Indemnitor does not object to any claim or claims made in the Officers Certificate in a written objection (the " _Objection_ ") delivered to such Indemnitee prior to the expiration of twenty (20) Business Days from the Indemnitors receipt of the Officers Certificate, the Indemnitor shall be deemed not to object to the information contained within the Officers Certificate. 

   

 (c) If the Indemnitor objects in writing to any claim or claims by the Indemnitee in the Officers Certificate, the parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith for twenty (20) Business Days after the Indemnitees receipt of such Objection.

 (d) If no resolution is reached, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of _Section 8.9_. 

  

 (e) In addition to any right or remedy available to any Buyer Indemnitee hereunder or otherwise, Buyer shall first proceed against the Deferred Payment to satisfy any indemnification claims against any Seller Indemnitor (any amounts which Buyer retains pursuant to this _Section 7.5(e)_ , the " _Deferred Payment Adjustment_ "). If the Deferred Payment has been fully exhausted in order to satisfy claims hereunder, then, subject to _Section 7.3(a)_, for claims relating to the Special Matters only, Buyer shall first proceed against Seller in pursuing its claim for Buyer Damages hereunder, and second against Vulcan only after it is determined in good faith by Buyer following a good faith effort to pursue such claim in accordance with the process set forth in this _Article VII_, that Seller is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations hereunder. 

  

 (f) The Deferred Payment less the Deferred Payment Adjustment, if any, shall be promptly released by Buyer to Vulcan on the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, except to the extent unresolved claims for Indemnifiable Damages are then pending against such amount pursuant to the provisions hereof.

Indemnitors __ shall have the right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with respect to the third-party claim to the extent that receipt of such documents does not affect any privilege relating to any Indemnitee and shall be entitled, at its expense, to reasonably participate in any defense of the third-party claim or settlement negotiations with respect to the third-party claim.

When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections or Exhibits, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The phrases "provided to," "furnished to," and phrases of similar import when used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, shall mean that a true, correct and complete paper copy of the information or material referred to has been provided to the party to whom such information or material is to be provided.

 8.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto, it being understood that all parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart. 

  

 8.4 _Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the other documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including all the exhibits attached hereto and the schedules hereto, (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for the Confidentiality Agreement which shall continue in full force and effect, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (ii) are not intended to confer, and shall not be construed as conferring, upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, except that _Article VII_ is intended to benefit Indemnitees. 

  

 8.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that Buyer may assign this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that the assignor shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Buyer separates one or more of its businesses (each a " _Separated Business_ "), whether by way of a sale, establishment of a joint venture, spin-off or otherwise (each a " _Separation Event_ "), Buyer may, without the prior written consent of the other parties and at no additional cost to Buyer, assign this Agreement such that it will continue to benefit the Separated Business and its Affiliates following the Separation Event. 

   ##### 

  

  

 8.6 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto shall use all reasonable best efforts to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision. 

  

 8.7 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. 

  

 8.8 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY LAW OR RULE THAT WOULD CAUSE THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE TO BE APPLIED. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF ANY COURT WITHIN KING COUNTY, STATE OF WASHINGTON, IN CONNECTION WITH ANY MATTER BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE PATENT PURCHASE AGREEMENT, THE OTHER ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS OR THE MATTERS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THEREIN, AGREES THAT PROCESS MAY BE SERVED UPON IT IN ANY MANNER AUTHORIZED BY THE STATE OF WASHINGTON FOR SUCH PERSONS AND WAIVES AND COVENANTS NOT TO ASSERT OR PLEAD ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE TO SUCH JURISDICTION, VENUE AND SUCH PROCESS. 

  

 8.9 _Mediation and Alternate Dispute Resolution_. 

  

 (a) The Seller Parties and Buyer mutually desire that friendly collaboration will develop among themselves. Accordingly, they shall try to resolve in a friendly manner all disagreements and misunderstandings connected with their respective rights and obligations under this Agreement, including any amendments hereof. 

  

 (b) Except for disputes with respect to Intellectual Property Rights which must be submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction, to the extent that any misunderstanding or dispute cannot be resolved agreeably in a friendly manner, the dispute will be mediated by a mutually-acceptable mediator to be chosen by the Seller Parties and Buyer within 45 days after written notice by one of the Parties demanding mediation. No Party may unreasonably withhold consent to the selection of a mediator, however, by mutual agreement the Seller Parties and Buyer may postpone mediation until each of them has completed specified but limited discovery with respect to a dispute. The Parties may also agree to attempt some other form of alternative dispute resolution (" _ADR_ ") in lieu of mediation, including by way of example and without limitation neutral fact-finding or a mini-trial. 

  

 (c) Any dispute, other than a dispute with respect to Intellectual Property Rights which must be submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction, which the Parties cannot resolve through negotiation, mediation or other form of ADR within six months of the date of the initial demand for it by one of the Parties may then be submitted to the courts for resolution. The use of any ADR procedures will not be construed under the doctrines of laches, waiver or estoppel to affect adversely the rights of 

   ##### 

  

 

either Party. Nothing in this _Section 8.9_ will prevent any Party from
resorting to judicial proceedings if (i) good faith efforts to resolve the
dispute under these procedures have been unsuccessful or (ii) interim relief
from a court is necessary to prevent serious and irreparable injury to one
Party or to others. 

   

 (d) Buyer and each of the Seller Parties shall bear its own costs of mediation or ADR, but Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller Parties, on the other hand, agree to share the costs of the mediation or ADR equally. 

  

 8.10 _Amendment; Extension; Waiver_. Subject to the provisions of applicable law, the parties hereto may amend this Agreement at any time pursuant to an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. At any time, either party hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Without limiting the generality or effect of the preceding sentence, no delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such right, and no waiver of any breach or default shall be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default of the same or any other provision in this Agreement. 

  

 8.11 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto have been represented by counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and, therefor, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, each schedule and each exhibit attached hereto or thereto, the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. 

  

 8.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
