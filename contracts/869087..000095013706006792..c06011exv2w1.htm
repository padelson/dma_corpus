 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_  

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter called this " _ _Agreement__ "), dated as of June 12, 2006, among MAVERICK TUBE CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the " _ _Company__ "), TENARIS S.A., a corporation organized under the laws of Luxembourg (" _ _Parent__ "), and OS ACQUISITION CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _ _Merger Sub__ "). 

  

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _ _Merger__ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and have approved and declared advisable this Agreement; and 

  

 WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

 _The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_   

  

 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _ _Surviving Corporation__ "), and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in Article II. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _ _DGCL__ "). 

  

 1.2. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _ _Closing__ ") shall take place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York, at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the third business day (the " _ _Closing Date__ ") following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII 

   ##### 

  

 

(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall
be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _ _business day__ " shall mean any day ending at
11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which
banks are required or authorized to close in the City of New York. 

   

 1.3. _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Company and Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger (the " _ _Delaware Certificate of Merger__ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Delaware Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties in writing and specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger (the " _ _Effective Time__ "). 

  

ARTICLE II 

   

 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws_ 
  _of the Surviving Corporation_   

  

 2.1. _The Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _ _Charter__ "), until duly amended as provided therein or by applicable Laws (as defined in Section 5.1(i)), except that Article FOURTH of the Charter shall be amended to read in its entirety as follows: "The aggregate number of shares that the Corporation shall have the authority to issue is 1,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share." Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Charter shall include provisions substantially identical to Articles TENTH and ELEVENTH of the certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time except for modifications thereof that are not adverse to the rights as of the Closing Date of beneficiaries of such provisions. 

  

 2.2. _The By-laws_. The by-laws of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _ _By-laws__ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Laws. 

  

ARTICLE III 

   

 _Officers and Directors_ 
  _of the Surviving Corporation_   

  

 3.1. _Directors_. The board of directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, consist of the directors of the Surviving 

   ##### 

  

 

Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Charter and the By-laws. The Company shall, if requested by Parent,
deliver resignations of directors of the Company, effective as of the
Effective Time. 

   

 3.2. _Officers_. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the By-laws. 

  

ARTICLE IV 

   

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_ 
  _Exchange of Certificates_   

  

 4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company: 

  

 (a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (together with the associated Rights (as defined in Section 5.1(b)(i)), each a " _ _Share__ " or, collectively, the " _ _Shares__ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties, and (ii) Shares that are owned by stockholders (" _ _Dissenting Stockholders__ ") who have perfected and not withdrawn or lost appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (each, an " _ _Excluded Share__ " and collectively, " _ _Excluded Shares__ ")) shall be converted into the right to receive $65 per Share (the " _ _Per Share Merger Consideration__ "). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _ _Certificate__ ") formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, and each certificate formerly representing Shares owned by Dissenting Stockholders shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the payment to which reference is made in Section 4.2(f). 

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each Excluded Share referred to in Section 4.1(a)(i) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist and each Excluded Share referred to in Section 4.1(a)(ii) shall be converted into the right to receive the payment to which reference is made in Section 4.2(f). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (the " _ _Paying Agent__ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments under Section 4.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _ _Exchange Fund__ "). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent,  _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 4.2(d). 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three business days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to (x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all 

   ##### 

  

 

documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to
evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not
applicable. 

   

 (c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article IV. 

  

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person (as defined below) shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _Person__ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 5.1(d)(i)) or other entity of any kind or nature. 

  

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration. 

  

 (f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other 

   ##### 

  

 

instruments served pursuant to applicable Laws that are received by the
Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand
for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve
any withdrawal of any such demands. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company Options or Company Awards (each as defined below) such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code (as defined in Section 5.1(h)(ii)), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax (as defined in Section 5.1(n)) law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of such Shares, Company Options or Company Awards in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. 

  

 4.3. _Treatment of Stock Plans_. 

  

 (a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time each outstanding option to purchase Shares (a " _ _Company Option__ ") under the Stock Plans (as defined in Section 5.1(b)(i)), vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive, promptly after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to the Company Option times (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Company Option less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment as provided in Section 4.2(g). 

  

 (b) _Company Awards_. At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Shares or benefits measured by the value of Shares, and each award of any kind consisting of Shares that, in each case, may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the Stock Plans and any other Benefit Plans (as defined in Section 5.1(h)(i)), other than Company Options (the " _ _Company Awards__ "), vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive an amount in cash which, at the Effective Time, shall be equal to (x) the number of Shares subject to such Company Award immediately prior to the Effective Time times (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (or, if the Company Award provides for payments to the extent the value of the Shares exceeds a specified reference price, the amount, if any, by which the Per Share Merger Consideration exceeds such reference price), less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment as provided in Section 4.2(g). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Section 4.3(a) and 4.3(b). The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Options or Company Awards. 

  

 4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted. 

  

ARTICLE V 

   

 _Representations and Warranties_   

  

 5.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company prior to entering into this Agreement (the " _ _Company Disclosure Letter__ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that: 

  

 (a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (as defined below) is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or similar entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the Companys and its Significant Subsidiaries (as defined below) certificates of incorporation and by-laws or comparable governing documents, each as amended to the date hereof, and each as so made available is in effect on the date hereof. As used in this Agreement, the term (i) " _ _Subsidiary__ " means, with respect to any Person, any other Person of which at least a majority of the securities or ownership interests 

    ##### 

 

    

having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board
of directors or other persons performing similar functions is directly or
indirectly owned or controlled by such Person and/or by one or more of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) " _ _Significant Subsidiary__ " is as defined in Rule
1.02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the " _ _Exchange Act__ ") and (iii) " _ _Material
Adverse Effect__ " with respect to the Company means a material adverse
effect on the financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities, business
or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent any effect is caused by or
results from any of the following, it shall not be taken into account in
determining whether there has been a Material Adverse Effect with respect to

 " _ _Acquisition Proposal__ " means any proposal or offer with respect to (i) a merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction or (ii) any other direct or indirect acquisition, in the case of clause (i) or (ii), involving 15% or more of the total voting power or of any class of equity securities of the Company or those of any of its Significant Subsidiaries, or 15% or more of the consolidated total assets (including, without limitation, equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to

Company may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company Recommendation
or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Superior Proposal
made after the date hereof that was not solicited, initiated, encouraged or
knowingly facilitated in breach of this Agreement, if the board of directors
of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that such action is necessary in order for the board of directors to
comply with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law (a " _
_Change of Recommendation__ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no Change of
Recommendation may be made until after at least 48 hours following Parents
receipt of written notice from the Company advising that management of
the Company currently intends to recommend to its board of directors that it
take such action and the basis therefor, including all necessary information

 6.11. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, and shall itself honor as if it were the Surviving Corporation, all rights to indemnification (including rights relating to advancement of expenses) or exculpation existing in favor of each present and former director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the " _ _Indemnified Parties__ "), with respect to any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, " _ _Costs__ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under Delaware law and its certificate of incorporation or by-laws in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such Person (and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances in the event of a non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to indemnification); and _provided_ , _further_ , that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an officers or directors conduct complies with the standards set forth under Delaware law and the Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws shall be made by independent counsel jointly selected by the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Party. 

   

 (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section 6.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent and the Surviving Corporation thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal 

     #####

matter, and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable
