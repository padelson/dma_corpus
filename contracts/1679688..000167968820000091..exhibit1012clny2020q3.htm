restrictions on transfer under applicable securities laws and the Loan
Documents evidencing and securing the applicable Existing Loan), and Buyer
agrees to purchase, accept and assume from Seller, all of Seller's right,
title and interest, if any, in the Membership Interests, free and clear of all
Liens (other than restrictions on transfer under applicable securities laws
and the Loan Documents evidencing and securing the applicable Existing Loan).
Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that, upon the sale and assignment of
the Membership Interests, each Hotel Owner shall retain all of its right,
title and interest in and to the following (herein collectively called the
"Property"):

(i)the Individual Hotels;

(ii)the Improvements;

(iii)the Appurtenant Interests;

(iv)the FFandE;

(v)the Consumables;

(vi)the Unopened Consumables;

(vii)the Food and Beverage;

(viii)the Operating Equipment;

(ix)the Trademarks;

(x)the Permits (other than Excluded Permits); (xi)the Hotel Books and Records;

(xii)all Bookings, Hotel Contracts, and the Ground Leases; and

(xiii)the Miscellaneous Hotel Assets.

Section 1.2.Purchase Price; Deposit.

(a)Buyer will pay the Purchase Price as described in this Section 1.2. All
payments by Buyer will be made in immediately available funds delivered into
escrow with Escrow Agent. Buyer shall deliver to Escrow Agent the Deposit
within one (1) Business Day after the Effective Date. Buyer will deliver the
balance of the Purchase Price on the Closing Date in accordance with Section
1.2(c). Escrow Agent will place the Deposit in a federally insured account on
behalf of Seller and Buyer and will otherwise hold the Deposit pursuant to the
Escrow Instructions.

(b)Upon Buyer's deposit of the Deposit, the Deposit shall become non-
refundable; provided, however, that the Deposit shall be refundable to Buyer
if this Agreement is terminated in a circumstance in which a return of the
Deposit to Buyer is expressly provided for in this Agreement.

(c)At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Escrow Agent in immediately
available funds an amount equal to (i) the Purchase Price, as adjusted in
accordance with this Agreement, minus (ii) the Deposit, plus (iii) any other
amounts required to be paid by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement at the
Closing. The amount calculated by the immediately preceding sentence will be
paid to Seller by Buyer and Escrow Agent at the Closing.

(d)The Deposit will be applied as follows: (i) if this Agreement is terminated
and it is expressly provided for in this Agreement that Buyer is entitled to
the Deposit, the Deposit (less the Transaction Fee, as provided in Section
1.2(e) below) (or the applicable Allocated Portfolio Interest Deposit(s), if
the termination involves less than all of the Hotel Portfolio Membership
Interests as mutually agreed to by the Parties) will be returned to Buyer;
(ii) if the Deposit is to be received by Seller as provided in this Agreement,
the Deposit will be paid to Seller; and (iii) if the Closing occurs, the
Deposit (or the Allocated Portfolio Interest Deposits, if the Closing will
involve the sale of less than all of the Hotel Portfolio Membership Interests
as permitted hereunder) will be credited to Buyer, applied against the
Purchase Price, and paid to Seller at the Closing.

(e)As part of Buyer's delivery of the Deposit to Escrow Agent, a portion shall
be allocated to the Transaction Fee. The Transaction Fee is the independent
consideration for the execution of this Agreement by Seller. Upon any
termination of this Agreement prior to the Closing, the Transaction Fee will
be deducted from the Deposit and paid by Escrow Agent to Seller. The
Transaction Fee is earned by Seller as of the Effective Date. The Transaction
Fee is non-refundable in all events, and any reference in this Agreement to a
return of the Deposit to Buyer will mean such amount "less the Transaction
Fee;" provided, however, that if the Closing occurs, the Transaction Fee will be included in the Deposit amount credited to
Buyer and applied to the Purchase Price as provided in Section 1.2(d) above.

Section 1.3.Assumption of Existing Loans.

(a)Subject to this Section 1.3, from and after the Effective Date, Seller
shall act in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, by
no later than the Consent Approval Date, the consent of each Existing Lender
(or its loan servicer, as applicable) to (i) the assignment and assumption of
the Membership Interests as set forth in this Agreement to Buyer (or its
assignee or designee), (ii) a full and unconditional release of all Seller
Guarantor Parties of all obligations and liabilities under the documents
evidencing and securing each Existing Loan and all other documents delivered
by Seller or its Affiliates in connection with each Existing Loan, including
all indemnities, guaranties and other undertakings (collectively, the "Loan
Documents") and any Seller Guarantees related to such Existing Loan, to the
extent accruing from and after the Closing (each, an "Existing Loan Release"),
(the consents described in clauses (i) and (ii) hereof, collectively, the
"Existing Lender's Consent"), and (iii) certain modifications to the Loan
Documents, which shall be evidenced by certain loan release and modification
documents to be negotiated between Seller, Buyer and each Existing Lender
(clauses (i) - (iii) hereof, collectively, the "Loan Release and Modification
Documents"), provided that such Loan Release and Modification Documents shall
be deemed acceptable so long as each Loan Release and Modification (a)
contains (w) such changes to the Loan Documents as are necessary to reflect
the organizational requirements of Buyer, Buyer's Credit Enhancers and
permitted transfer provisions that are necessitated by Buyer's and Buyer's
Credit Enhancer's organizational structures and to eliminate references or
requirements that reflect the organizational requirements of Seller, (y)
approval of Buyer's Affiliate as the replacement hotel manager, and (z) such
non-material changes as are otherwise required by Existing Lender which shall
in all instances exclude Unacceptable Modifications, (b) state the then
outstanding principal balance of the Existing Loan, (c) provide for the
Existing Loan Release, or if any Existing Lender will not provide the Existing
Loan Release, then inclusion of such post-Closing claims by any Existing
Lender in the Buyer Indemnity, (d) does not require Buyer to assume any Seller
Excluded Guaranties, or if any Existing Lender will not exclude such Seller
Excluded Guaranties, one or more creditworthy entities proposed by Seller and
reasonably acceptable to Buyer will deliver an indemnity in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Buyer agreeing to indemnify, defend and hold Buyer
and Buyer's Credit Enhancers free and harmless from any and all obligations
and liabilities with respect to any post-Closing claims by any Existing Lender
relating to the Seller Excluded Guaranties, and (e) no Unacceptable
Modifications (collectively, the items described in clauses (i), (ii), and
(iii) hereof, collectively, the "Loan Release and Modification"). In
connection with each Loan Release and Modification Application (as hereinafter
defined), Buyer shall provide all information required under the Loan
Documents with respect to a Loan Release and Modification and provide all
information or documentation reasonably requested by any Existing Lender.

(b)As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date, Seller and
Buyer shall coordinate to promptly submit all information then available as
required under the Loan Documents in connection with the contemplated Loan
Release and Modification to each Existing Lender of the Existing Loans (or, as applicable, its servicer) (each, a "Loan
Release and Modification Application"). Costs, expenses and fees payable in
connection with obtaining the Loan Release and Modifications shall be as
agreed by the Parties.

(c)Seller and Buyer each shall use good faith efforts to promptly comply with
any and all Loan Release and Modification requirements set forth in the Loan
Documents and reasonable requests made by each Existing Lender for
information, statements, materials, legal opinions, information necessary to
obtain rating agency confirmation, title endorsements, and other items
reasonably requested by any Existing Lender in connection with such Existing
Lender's consideration of the request for each Loan Release and Modification.
After submission of the Loan Release and Modification Application by Buyer and
Seller, Buyer and Seller shall work together in good faith to pursue and
procure each Loan Release and Modification, and each of Buyer and Seller shall
keep the other Party copied on all correspondence and reasonably informed of
its efforts to obtain each Loan Release and Modification. Each of Buyer and
Seller shall pay their own legal fees in connection with obtaining the Loan
Release and Modifications.

(d)The Parties shall request that each Loan Release and Modification include
the commitment of the Existing Lender to provide an Existing Loan Release as
contemplated by this Section 1.3. Seller's obligation to complete the sale of
the Membership Interests to Buyer is expressly conditioned upon each Seller
and the other Seller Guarantor Parties receiving at or prior to the Closing
either (i) an Existing Loan Release in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Seller for the period from and after the Closing or (ii) in the
event any Existing Lender refuses to provide an Existing Loan Release, a Buyer
Indemnity for any claims made against Seller Guarantor Parties for obligations
and liabilities under the Loan Documents and Seller Guarantees with respect
thereto to the extent accruing from and after the Closing (provided, however,
this clause (ii) shall not be applicable to the Innkeepers Hotel Portfolio and
Innkeepers Seller's obligation to complete the sale of the Membership
Interests of the Innkeepers Hotel Portfolio to Buyer is expressly conditioned
upon Innkeepers Seller and the other applicable Seller Guarantor Parties for
the Innkeepers Hotel Portfolio receiving at or prior to the Closing an
Existing Loan Release, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by such
applicable Seller Guarantor Parties in their respective sole and absolute
discretion). Buyer agrees that one or more of Buyer's Credit Enhancers shall
execute and deliver all required substitute indemnities and guaranties with
respect to the period from and after the Closing Date if and to the extent the
same are required by such Existing Lender so long as such requirement does not
include any Unacceptable Modifications, unless otherwise agreed to by Buyer in
its sole and absolute discretion. Buyer agrees to propose a replacement hotel
manager and substitute indemnitors and guarantors to each Existing Lender that
satisfy the relevant conditions and tests for the same in the Loan Documents.
Buyer acknowledges that the Seller Parties shall not have any liability in the
event that an Existing Lender does not provide a Loan Release and
Modification. The provisions of this Section 1.3(d) shall survive the Closing.

(e)If any Loan Release and Modification has not been obtained on or before the
Consent Approval Date with respect to any Existing Loan despite Seller and
Buyer's good faith and commercially reasonable efforts, then each of Buyer and
Seller shall have the right to extend the Closing Date in accordance with
Section 5.1 hereof in order to continue to seek any such Loan Release and Modification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any
Loan Release and Modification has not been obtained for a particular Hotel
Portfolio by the Consent Approval Outside Date, either Party may terminate
this Agreement, whereupon this Agreement, and the obligations of the Parties
hereunder shall terminate without further action of any Party (and no Party
shall have any further obligation in connection herewith except for
Obligations Surviving Termination). If any Loan Release and Modification is
conditioned on an Unacceptable Modification, then Buyer shall have the option
to terminate this Agreement, unless Seller agrees to pay any amounts required
to comply with the Unacceptable Modification if such Unacceptable Modification
can be addressed through the payment of money. Any such payment by Seller
shall be from funds outside of the Acquired Accounts.

(f)For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties may mutually agree to terminate
this Agreement solely with respect to the Membership Interests for any Hotel
Portfolio(s) for which such Loan Release and Modification has not been
obtained, whereupon (i) this Agreement, and the obligations of the Parties
hereunder shall terminate solely with respect to such Hotel Portfolio
Membership Interest(s) for which such Loan Release and Modification has not
been obtained without further action of any Party (and no Party shall have any
further obligation in connection herewith except for Obligations Surviving
Termination), and (ii) this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
with respect to the Hotel Portfolio Membership Interest(s) for which an Loan
Release and Modification has been obtained, and the terms and provisions of
Section 1.6 hereof shall apply.

Section 1.4.Allocated Purchase Price Amounts and Allocated Individual Hotel
Valuation. Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
agree, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date (but in no
event later than fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing Date), upon (i) the
Allocated Portfolio Interest Purchase Price, (ii) the Allocated Individual
Hotel Interest Purchase Price, (iii) the Allocated Individual Hotel Valuation
with respect to each Individual Hotel Membership Interest, and (iv) the
allocation of any portion of the Purchase Price to Personal Property. If
Seller and Buyer reach agreement on the Allocated Individual Interest Hotel
Valuation, then Buyer and Seller shall file federal, state and local Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with the Allocated Individual Hotel Valuation
and shall otherwise be bound by such Allocated Individual Hotel Valuation
(including the preparation of all books, records and tax filings) unless
otherwise required by Applicable Law. If Seller and Buyer cannot reach
agreement on the Allocated Individual Hotel Valuation, then each Party shall
file federal, state and local Tax Returns based on each Party's own
determination of the Allocated Individual Hotel Valuation, each bearing its
own consequences of any discrepancies and there shall be no further obligation
of either party under this Section 1.4, provided that, Buyer's proposed
allocation shall control for purposes of paying any Transfer Taxes in
connection with the Closing and for purposes of determining the insured amount
for any Title Policy. This Section 1.4 shall survive the Closing.

Section 1.5.Escrow Instructions. This Agreement, including the Escrow
Instructions, will constitute the instructions for Escrow Agent's handling of
the purchase and sale transaction contemplated herein. Seller and Buyer will
execute such supplemental escrow instructions as may reasonably be required by
Escrow Agent to enable Escrow Agent to comply with the terms of this Agreement. If any conflict exists between this
Agreement and the provisions of any supplemental escrow instructions, the
terms of this Agreement will control unless a contrary intent is expressly
indicated in the supplemental instructions and such supplemental instructions
are signed by both Buyer and Seller.

Section 1.6.All or Nothing Purchase and Sale.

(a)Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that the direct and indirect equity
interests for the Target Entities and the Target Subsidiaries and Hotel Owner
and Operating Tenant of each Individual Hotel and the Hotel Owners and
Operating Tenants of each Hotel Portfolio shall be sold together as a package
(subject to the terms of the last sentence of Section 5.1 hereof). Except as
may be mutually agreed to by the Parties, any rights of Seller or Buyer
contained herein to terminate this Agreement shall require termination of the
entire Agreement and shall not be construed as giving any Party the right to
exclude, or terminate only as to, one (1) or more of the direct and indirect
equity interests of the Target Entities and the Target Subsidiaries and the
Hotel Owner and Operating Tenant of any Individual Hotel or the Hotel Owners
and Operating Tenants of any Hotel Portfolio.

(b)To the extent this Agreement is terminated with respect to less than all of
the Hotel Portfolio Membership Interests as mutually agreed to by the Parties,
this Agreement shall be deemed amended as follows with respect to such Hotel
Portfolio Membership Interest(s) (each, a "Terminated Portfolio Membership
Interest" and collectively, the "Terminated Portfolio Membership Interests"),
but shall otherwise remain in full force and effect:

i. The definition of Property, Individual Hotels, Hotel Owners, Hotel
Portfolios, and Hotel Portfolio Membership Interests shall not include such
Terminated Portfolio Membership Interests, or the applicable Individual
Hotels, Hotel Owners or Hotel Portfolios of such Terminated Portfolio
Membership Interests, or the Property used in or relating to the ownership,
occupancy or operation of any part of such Individual Hotel, except to the
extent that any Obligations Surviving Termination would be applicable to such
Terminated Portfolio Membership Interests (or to the extent necessary to
implement this Section 1.6);

ii. The Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Portfolio Interest
Purchase Price of such Terminated Portfolio Membership Interest and the
Deposit shall be reduced by the Allocated Portfolio Interest Deposit of such
Terminated Portfolio Membership Interest; and

iii. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any obligations with respect to such
Terminated Portfolio Membership Interests except for Obligations Surviving
Termination, nor shall any covenant, representation or warranty be deemed made
with respect to such Terminated Portfolio Membership Interests.

Section 1.7.Withholding. Provided that the certificates described in Section
5.4(ii), (iii) and (xvi) hereof are delivered and Buyer has obtained the Tax
Clearance Certificate described in Section 8.5 hereof and Seller has delivered
the Tax Good Standing Certificate described in Section 8.7 hereof, Buyer hereby confirms that it does not
currently intend to deduct or withhold Taxes from any amounts otherwise
payable under this Agreement. In the event of any changes in applicable Tax
Law or the facts or circumstances of Seller, following the Effective Date,
after good faith consultation with Seller, Buyer shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold any applicable Taxes on payments to be made by it pursuant to
this Agreement in accordance with such changes. Buyer shall notify Seller
reasonably in advance of any payment giving rise to such deduction or
withholding and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Seller to obtain any available reduction of, or relief from, any such
deduction or withholding. Any amounts that are so withheld and timely paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Authority shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

ARTICLE 2

BUYER'S INVESTIGATIONs; AS-IS, WHERE-IS SALE.

Section 2.1.Buyer's Investigations.

(a)Buyer shall have the right to conduct such commercially reasonable, non-
invasive investigations, studies or tests of the Property as Buyer deems
necessary or desirable in connection with Buyer's acquisition of the
Membership Interests and, indirectly, of the Property. Notwithstanding the
foregoing rights in this Section 2.1 to inspect the Property and otherwise
conduct diligence relating to the Membership Interests and the Property, Buyer
acknowledges that there is no "due diligence period" or "due diligence
termination right" in this Agreement and Buyer does not have the right to
terminate this Agreement based on the results of such inspections or for any
other reason except pursuant to an express termination right set forth in this
Agreement.

(b)Buyer acknowledges that prior to the Effective Date, subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, Seller has delivered to Buyer, or made available to
Buyer by posting on a the Datasite to which Buyer has been given access,
certain Due Diligence Materials, in each case, to the extent in Seller's or
the applicable Hotel Owner's possession. Seller will have no obligation to
deliver or disclose to Buyer any of Seller's or Hotel Owner's attorney-client
privileged materials, appraisals, internal memoranda, or internal evaluations
of the Property, or any materials that are confidential and proprietary with
respect to the operation, financial condition or finances of Seller's
Affiliates that are not part of the Target Group. Except as may be otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Closing Documents, Seller makes
no representations or warranties of any kind regarding the accuracy,
thoroughness or completeness of or conclusions drawn in the information
contained in any Due Diligence Materials. Seller shall promptly deliver any
additional information or documentation regarding the Membership Interests or
the Property reasonably requested by Buyer to the extent in the possession or
control of Seller, Seller's Affiliate or the applicable Hotel Manager. Buyer
shall acknowledge, in writing, upon Seller's request, the receipt of any Due
Diligence Materials delivered to Buyer.

(c)If this Agreement is terminated for any reason or no reason, Buyer will
promptly return to Seller any Due Diligence Materials delivered to Buyer in
physical form in connection with the Membership Interests or the Property. This Section 2.1(c) shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.

Section 2.2.Title Matters; Violations.

(a)Title Policies. To the extent Buyer elects to obtain owner's or lender's
title insurance policies (each, a "Title Policy" and collectively, the "Title
Policies") in respect of any Individual Hotel in connection with the Closing
of the purchase and sale transaction contemplated hereunder, Seller shall (or
shall cause each Hotel Owner to) (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to
comply with the customary requirements of Title Company in connection with the
issuance of such Title Policies, and (ii) cause delivery of a customary non-
imputation affidavit and customary title affidavits, as applicable, in each
case executed by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller that is not part of the
Target Group reasonably acceptable to Title Company.

(b)Liens. Seller shall remove (i) any monetary Lien that is not permitted
under any of the Loan Documents and which is not being contested in accordance
with the Loan Documents, (ii) any Lien securing a judgment against any Target
Entity or Target Subsidiary encumbering the Property which is not currently
being contested or appealed (in each case, prior to the expiration of any
appeal periods), and (iii) any monetary Lien (other than any Lien securing a
judgment which is not currently being contested or appealed (in each case,
prior to the expiration of any appeal periods)) encumbering any Individual
Hotel other than (A) Permitted Liens (but not any Permitted Lien described in
clause (b)(ii) of the definition thereof) or (B) any Lien created by Buyer or
any lessee under any Hotel Lease, in each case, (x) to the extent any such
monetary Lien may be removed by payment of a fixed, liquidated sum of money,
provided that (I) Seller shall not be obligated to (or to cause the applicable
Hotel Owner to) spend more than Three Million and No/100 Dollars
($3,000,000.00) in the aggregate with respect to the preceding clauses (i) and
(iii) (the "Title Cap"), and (II) Seller shall have the right to first utilize
funds in the Acquired Accounts, subject to and in accordance with the terms of
any applicable Loan Documents, to remove any Lien described in the preceding
clauses (i) and (iii), and (y) if any such Lien securing a judgment which is
not currently being contested or appealed (in each case, prior to the
expiration of any appeal periods) or monetary Lien is bonded over by Seller or
any other Person at or prior to the Closing or if Seller or the applicable
Hotel Owner escrows sufficient funds with Title Company or provides an
indemnity acceptable to Title Company such that such Lien securing a judgment
which is not currently being contested or appealed (in each case, prior to the
expiration of any appeal periods) or monetary Lien is omitted from the
applicable Title Policy (or is otherwise insured over by Title Company in a
manner reasonably acceptable to Buyer and without additional cost to Buyer),
then Seller shall be deemed to have removed such monetary Lien. For the
avoidance of doubt, (I) except as otherwise set forth in this Section 2.2(b),
Seller has no obligation to (or to cause the applicable Hotel Owner to) bring
any action or proceeding or otherwise incur any expense to cure, remove or
otherwise address any matter contained in the Title Policies, and (II) Buyer
obtaining such Title Policies shall not be a condition precedent to Buyer's
obligation to close hereunder. If there are monetary Liens in excess of the
Title Cap which Seller elects not to remove, Buyer shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement, whereupon this Agreement, and the obligations of the
Parties hereunder shall terminate without further action of any Party (and no Party shall have any
further obligation in connection herewith except for Obligations Surviving
Termination).

(c)Violations. Buyer agrees to purchase the Membership Interests and,
indirectly, the Property subject to any and all Violations, or any condition
or state of repair or disrepair or other matter or thing, whether or not
noted, which, if noted, would result in a Violation being placed on such
Property. Seller shall have no duty to (or to cause the applicable Hotel Owner
to) remove or comply with or repair any condition, matter or thing whether or
not noted, which, if noted, would result in a Violation being placed on such
Property. Seller shall have no duty to (or to cause the applicable Hotel Owner
to) remove or comply with or repair any of the aforementioned Violations, or
other conditions and Buyer shall accept each Property at the Closing subject
to such Violations, the existence of any conditions at such Property which
would give rise to such Violations, if any, and any governmental claims
arising from the existence of such Violations, in each case without any
abatement of or credit against the Purchase Price. For the avoidance of doubt,
the failure to (or to cause the applicable Hotel Owner to) cure any open
Violations or to remove, comply with or repair any condition, matter or thing
whether or not noted, which, if noted, would result in a Violation being
placed on any Property shall not be a condition precedent to Buyer's
obligation to close hereunder and Buyer shall have no right to terminate this
Agreement with respect to any the Membership Interests of any Hotel Portfolio
or any Individual Hotel in connection with any such failure. This Section
2.2(c) shall not in any way limit Seller's obligations under Section 3.1(a)
hereof.

Section 2.3.Entry, Insurance and Indemnity.

(a)Buyer must give Seller not less than twenty-four (24) hours' prior notice
of any desired entry by any Buyer Parties onto any Individual Hotel and must
coordinate such entry and any related testing or inspections with the
applicable Selling Entity so as to minimize, to the greatest extent possible,
any interference with the business of such Individual Hotel. All such entries
shall be conducted between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. (local time) on a Business
Day, unless otherwise agreed to by Buyer and Seller. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer may not enter the premises of, or contact or speak to, on-
site manager (but expressly excluding any Marriott Manager in connection with
Buyer's obligations under Section 3.5 hereof), any Franchisor (but expressly
excluding any Franchisor in connection with Buyer's obligations under Section
3.5 hereof), employee, guest or occupant of the Property without Seller's
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Buyer's entry rights are subject to all applicable
provisions of the Franchise Agreement for that Individual Hotel, the Hotel
Management Agreement for that Individual Hotel and any applicable Hotel Leases
for that Individual Hotel. All inspections must be performed in such a manner
so as to not damage the Property and Buyer must otherwise conduct each entry
upon any Individual Hotel in a commercially reasonably manner. Seller shall
have the right to have an employee, agent or representative present during any
entry by any Buyer Parties onto any Individual Hotel.

(b)Buyer may not conduct any physically invasive testing, coring, drilling, or
boring at any Individual Hotel, or any environmental testing of any Individual
Hotel other than a standard ASTM "Phase I" environmental study, without in
each instance obtaining the prior written approval of Seller, which approval may be withheld in Seller's sole
and absolute discretion and, if granted, will be conditioned upon such
precautions as Seller deems advisable to protect itself and the Individual
Hotel. If such invasive work is approved, then prior to any Buyer Party
entering the Individual Hotel for any such invasive work, Buyer will submit to
Seller for review and approval a written work plan describing to Seller's
satisfaction the proposed work and the parties which will perform such work (a
"Work Plan"). Buyer will not commence such proposed invasive work prior to
Seller's written approval of any Work Plan. The parties agree that the
performance of a Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment pursuant to ASTM
protocol, that does not entail any penetration of the surface of the Property
or collection of any soil or water samples, does not constitute invasive work
requiring a Work Plan.

(c) Buyer will, at its sole cost and expense, comply in all material respects
with all Applicable Law with respect to its inspections conducted pursuant to
this Section 2.3. Promptly following completion of any such inspections, Buyer
will, at its sole cost and expense, remove from the Property any and all waste
or debris generated from its activities and restore the Property to
substantially the same condition as existed immediately prior to the Buyer
Parties' entry to the Property. Buyer will use due care in connection with all
inspections. All of Buyer's agents, contractors, subcontractors or employees
conducting inspections on behalf or at the request of Buyer will do so only in
compliance with all terms of this Agreement.

(d)Buyer will maintain, at its sole cost and expense, and will require that
any Buyer Party entering upon the Property also maintains, commercial general
liability insurance with a financially responsible insurance company insuring
the Buyer Parties against any liability arising out of their activities in,
upon, about or with respect to the Property, with limits of at least One
Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence and One Million and
No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in the aggregate (which limits may include
applicable excess or umbrella coverage). Buyer's policy must (i) name Seller
and the other Seller Parties as additional insureds with respect to all Claims
arising out of the activities of the Buyer Parties in, upon, about or with
respect to the Property, (ii) contain a cross-liability provision, and (iii)
be primary and noncontributing with any other insurance available to Seller
and the other Seller Parties. Buyer must provide Seller with evidence that
Buyer has such insurance coverages in force prior to any entry by a Buyer
Party upon any Individual Hotel.

(e)Buyer (i) will pay all costs incurred in connection with Buyer's due
diligence activities regarding the Membership Interests and Property, (ii)
will promptly, at Buyer's sole cost and expense, repair and restore any damage
caused to the Property or any other property owned by a Person other than
Buyer by such activities, and (iii) will not permit any mechanics or other
liens to be filed against the Property as a result of such activities. If any
such lien is filed against the Property, Buyer will cause the same to be
discharged of record, either by payment of the claim or by bonding, within
twenty (20) days after receipt of written demand from Seller. BUYER WILL
INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD THE SELLER PARTIES HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY
CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF ANY ACTIVITIES OF THE BUYER PARTIES IN, UPON, ABOUT OR
WITH RESPECT TO THE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS OR THE PROPERTY PRIOR TO THE CLOSING;
provided, however, such indemnity, defense and obligation to hold the Seller
Parties harmless shall not extend to protect Sellers Parties from Claims resulting from (A) the
negligence or willful misconduct of any Seller or any Seller Party, and (B)
any pre-existing condition merely discovered by Buyer (e.g., latent
environmental contamination) except to the extent Buyer's actions exacerbate
such pre-existing condition or disturb any such latent environmental
contamination. Buyer's indemnity and insurance obligations under this Article
2 are not limited by any other limitation on damages or remedies under this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the liquidated damages provisions
contained in Article 6 hereof, other than the limitation that in no event will
either Party be liable to the other Party for any consequential, special or
punitive damages suffered by such Party. The terms of this Section 2.3(e) will
survive the Closing or any earlier termination of this Agreement.

Section 2.4.AS-IS, WHERE-IS SALE. BUYER SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT, EXCEPT FOR SELLER'S REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS AS
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CLOSING DOCUMENTS, (A) SELLER IS
SELLING AND BUYER IS PURCHASING THE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS "AS IS, WHERE IS AND
WITH ALL FAULTS" AND (B) BUYER IS NOT RELYING ON ANY REPRESENTATIONS,
WARRANTIES, COVENANTS OR AGREEMENTS OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, WHETHER ORAL OR
WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, FROM SELLER, ANY HOTEL
OWNER OR ANY OTHER SELLER PARTY AS TO ANY MATTER CONCERNING OR RELATING TO THE

THEREOF), INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION: (I) THE QUALITY, NATURE,

(II) THE DIMENSIONS OR LOT SIZE OF ANY REAL PROPERTY OR THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF
THE IMPROVEMENTS THEREON OR OF ANY OCCUPANT'S SPACE THEREIN OR COMMON AREAS
THEREOF; (III) THE DEVELOPMENT OR INCOME POTENTIAL, OR RIGHTS OF OR RELATING
TO, THE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS OR THE PROPERTY, OR THE SUITABILITY, VALUE,
ADEQUACY, OR FITNESS OF THE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS OR THE PROPERTY FOR ANY
PARTICULAR PURPOSE; (IV) THE ZONING OR OTHER LEGAL STATUS OF THE PROPERTY OR
ANY OTHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF THE PROPERTY; (V) THE
COMPLIANCE OF THE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS OR THE PROPERTY OR ITS OPERATION WITH
ANY APPLICABLE LAW OF ANY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY OR OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR
ENTITY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT);
(VI) THE ABILITY OF BUYER TO OBTAIN ANY NECESSARY GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS,
LICENSES OR PERMITS FOR THE CURRENT USE OR BUYER'S INTENDED USE, DEVELOPMENT OR REDEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPERTY; (VII) THE PRESENCE
OR ABSENCE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS OR OTHER HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS ON, IN, UNDER,

Buyer further recognizes that the Individual Hotels are not new and that there
exists the possibility that the Individual Hotels are not in compliance with
the requirements which would be imposed on a newly constructed hotel by
presently effective Applicable Law. The Real Property may contain substances
or materials no longer permitted to be used in newly constructed buildings
including, without limitation, asbestos or other insulation materials, lead or
other paints, wiring, electrical or plumbing materials and may not contain
other materials or equipment required to be installed in a newly constructed
building. Buyer has and will have had the opportunity to conduct such
investigations and inspections of the Membership Interests and the Individual
Hotels as Buyer deemed reasonably necessary with respect to all such matters.
Buyer agrees to accept and assume the risk of non-compliance of the Membership
Interests, any Individual Hotel and/or the Property with all Applicable Law,
except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Closing
Documents and the covenants of Seller under this Agreement and the Closing
Documents. Buyer waives any right to excuse or delay performance of its
obligations under this Agreement or to assert any claim against a Seller Party
(before or after the Closing) arising out of any failure of any Membership
Interests, any Individual Hotel or the Property to comply with Applicable Law,
except in contravention of the express representations and warranties made by
Seller in this Agreement or the covenants of Seller under this Agreement and
the Closing Documents. IF BUYER PURCHASES THE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS AND, INDIRECTLY, THE PROPERTY, ANY
REPORTS, REPAIRS OR WORK REQUIRED OF OR BY BUYER ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY
OF BUYER, AND BUYER AGREES THAT THERE IS NO OBLIGATION ON THE PART OF ANY
SELLER PARTY EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE CLOSING TO MAKE ANY CHANGES,
ALTERATIONS OR REPAIRS TO THE PROPERTY OR TO CURE ANY VIOLATIONS OF LAW OR TO
COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ANY INSURER OR GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY. BUYER
IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING THE ISSUANCE OR RE-ISSUANCE OF ANY
CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY OR ANY OTHER APPROVAL OR PERMIT NECESSARY FOR
TRANSFER OR OCCUPANCY OF THE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS OR THE PROPERTY OR ANY
PORTION THEREOF AND FOR ANY IMPROVEMENTS, REPAIRS OR ALTERATIONS NECESSARY TO
OBTAIN THE SAME, ALL AT BUYER'S SOLE COST AND EXPENSE.

Section 2.5.Release. Without limiting the provisions of Section 2.4 above, but
subject to the express rights and remedies reserved to Buyer in this Agreement
and the Closing Documents, Buyer, for itself and the other Buyer Parties,
waives all rights to recover from, and forever releases, discharges and
covenants not to sue, Seller and the other Seller Parties with respect to any
and all Claims, whether direct or indirect, known or unknown, foreseen or
unforeseen, that may exist or arise on account of or in any way be connected
with the Membership Interests or the Property (including, without limitation,
the physical, operational, environmental, and structural condition of the
Property) or any Applicable Law, including, without limitation, any Claims or
other matters relating to the use, presence, discharge or release of Hazardous
Materials on, under, in, above or about the Property. Buyer assumes the risk
that Buyer's investigations of the Membership Interests and the Property may
not reveal all aspects and conditions of the Membership Interests or the
Property; provided, however, this release shall not apply to Claims arising
out of any Seller Party's fraud, intentional misrepresentation or breach of
its obligations under this Agreement or the Closing Documents (but such breach
of its obligations under this Agreement or the Closing Documents shall be
subject in all instances to the limitations in Article 6 hereof) nor prohibit
Buyer from raising as a defense in any proceeding involving, or in otherwise
responding to, any third party claim that such circumstance resulting in the
claim existed prior to Buyer's ownership of the Property. Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that: (a) Buyer is an experienced and knowledgeable purchaser of
real property; (b) Buyer expressly accepts and fully understands the
limitations of liability contained in this Agreement; and (c) the limitations
contained in this Agreement are reasonable. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
Seller has agreed to enter into this Agreement in consideration for and in
reliance upon the limitations of liability contained in this Agreement, that
the Purchase Price is based in part on such limitations of liability, and that
Seller would not have agreed to execute this Agreement or sell the Property to
Buyer on terms that did not include such limitations of liability.

THE WAIVERS AND RELEASES CONTAINED IN SECTION 2.4 ABOVE AND THIS SECTION 2.5
EXTEND TO ALL CLAIMS OF ANY NATURE AND KIND WHATSOEVER, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN,
SUSPECTED OR NOT SUSPECTED, AND, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY
APPLICABLE LAW, BUYER WAIVES ANY PROVISIONS OF APPLICABLE LAW WHICH OTHERWISE MAY LIMIT OR PROHIBIT SUCH WAIVERS AND
RELEASES, IN EACH CASE, EXCEPT FOR SUCH CLAIMS AS EXIST UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
AND THE CLOSING DOCUMENTS. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 2.5 WILL SURVIVE THE
CLOSING OR ANY EARLIER TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Article 2
shall restrict, restrain or prohibit any claim of Buyer or any Buyer Party
based on fraud.

Measures, provided that Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of such
actions and shall give Buyer prior written notice if such compliance requires
the expenditure of more than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars
($250,000.00).

e.Buyer shall be deemed to have granted its consent to any requests for
approval in this Section 3.1 if Buyer does not respond to the applicable

fees in connection with such applications and instruments. Seller, subject to
the next succeeding sentence, shall preserve (or cause any Hotel Owner or
their respective Affiliates to preserve) in force all existing Permits and

same are necessary for the operation of the applicable Individual Hotel. If
any such Permit (other than Excluded Permits) shall be suspended or revoked,
Seller shall promptly so notify Buyer and shall cause the reinstatement of
such Permit without any additional limitation or condition.

Section 3.2.Casualty and Condemnation. If at any time prior to the Closing,
(i) any Improvements or the Real Property of any Individual Hotel is damaged
or destroyed by a fire or other casualty event (a "Casualty") or (ii) any
condemnation proceedings are instituted, or notice of any condemnation or
intent to condemn is given, with respect to all or any portion of the Real
Property of any Individual Hotel (a "Condemnation"), Seller shall promptly
give Buyer written notice thereof. To the extent that, prior to the Closing,
Seller, any Hotel Owner or any of their respective Affiliates receives
insurance proceeds from any casualty insurance policies and/or condemnation
proceeds in respect of such Casualty or Condemnation ("Proceeds"), Seller
shall, at Seller's election, either: (i) use (or cause the applicable Hotel
Owner or their applicable Affiliates to use) commercially reasonable efforts
to use such Proceeds to repair such damage or destruction, or replace such
taken property, as applicable ("Restoration of the Property"), or (ii) give
Buyer a credit at the Closing against the Purchase Price in an amount equal to
the Proceeds, if any, received by Seller, any Hotel Owner or such Affiliate as
a result of such Casualty or Condemnation, together with a credit for any
deductible under such insurance, plus a credit for any portion of a Casualty
that is not covered by insurance if and solely to the extent that the failure
of such portion to not be covered by insurance is the direct result of any
Seller Party's failure to comply with the insurance provisions of the Loan
Documents with respect to the affected Individual Hotel(s), less any amounts
spent for Restoration of the Property or in connection with the collection of
such Proceeds. If, as of the Closing, none of Seller, any Hotel Owner or their
respective Affiliates has received any such insurance or condemnation
proceeds, then, at the Closing, Seller will (or cause the applicable Hotel
Owner or its applicable Affiliate to) assign to Buyer all rights of Seller (or
the applicable Hotel Owner or their respective Affiliates), if any, to the
insurance or condemnation proceeds and to all other rights or claims arising
out of or in connection with such Casualty or Condemnation, and shall credit

liability to Seller or any Hotel Owner, cooperate and instruct the applicable
Hotel Manager to reasonably cooperate with Buyer in its efforts with respect
to the Liquor Licenses; provided, however, that (i) the issuance and/or
transfer of the Liquor Licenses shall not be a condition to Buyer's
obligations to close the purchase and sale transaction contemplated herein and
(ii) Buyer shall not have the right to extend the Closing or terminate or
cancel this Agreement based on the absence or lack of any Liquor Licenses. If
Buyer is unable to obtain any Liquor License for any Individual Hotel that is
in the name of any Hotel Manager or its Affiliates (other than any Marriott
Manager) prior to the Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such Hotel Managers to comply with the transition obligations

release described in the foregoing clause (i), a "Marriott Manager's
Consent"), which Marriott Manager Release shall be in a form and substance
customarily provided by such Marriott Manager. In the event Marriott Manager
refuses to provide a Marriott Manager Release, Buyer's Credit Enhancers shall

a Marriott Manager Release or Buyer Indemnity shall be treated for purposes of
this Section 3.5 as a Marriott Manager's Consent. Buyer and Seller shall work
together in good faith to pursue and procure each Marriott Manager's Consent,

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event one or more Ground Lessor's

Date, either Party may terminate this Agreement, whereupon this Agreement, and
the obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate without further

Interests of any Hotel Portfolio(s) for which Ground Lessor's Consent has been
obtained or were not needed, and the terms and provisions of Section 1.6
hereof shall apply. For the avoidance of doubt, receipt of any Ground Lease
Estoppels shall not be a condition precedent to Buyer's obligation to close
hereunder and Buyer shall have no right to terminate this Agreement with
respect to the Membership Interests of any Hotel Portfolio or any Individual
Hotel for any failure to obtain any Ground Lease Estoppel.

(b)Buyer and Seller shall work together in good faith to pursue and procure
each Ground Lessor's Consent, and each of Buyer and Seller shall keep the
other Party copied on all correspondence and reasonably informed of its
efforts to obtain each Ground Lessor's Consent. Costs, expenses and fees
payable in connection with obtaining the Ground Lessor's Consents shall be as
agreed by the Parties. Each of Buyer and Seller shall pay their own legal fees
in connection with obtaining the Ground Lessor's Consents.

hereunder provided any restructuring (including any restructuring to an asset
deal) shall require the consent of both Parties. Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with Buyer in connection with requesting any additional estoppels or
consents required by any Existing Lender or Title Company, provided that
obtaining such estoppels or consents shall not alone be a closing condition.
If the K-Partner Subordinate Lender does not agree to a replacement borrower
for the K-Partners Holdings A Loan and K-Partners Holdings B Loan, Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its joint venture partner
in the K-Partners Hotel Portfolio to participate in the sale of K-Partners
Seller to Buyer in the place of K-Partners Target.

Section 3.8.No Leakage. Following the Effective Date, Seller shall not permit
any Target Entity or Target Subsidiary to incur, assume, suffer to exist or
otherwise become liable for any Leakage. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of
any such Leakage. Any amount of Leakage that does so exist at the Closing in
violation of this Agreement shall result in a dollar-for-dollar reduction to the Purchase Price at the Closing, provided, that if Buyer only
becomes aware of such Leakage during the six (6)-month period following the
Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall pay to Buyer an amount an amount
equal to such Leakage promptly following written request therefor by Buyer.
This Section 3.8 shall survive the Closing.

have any liability. No deficiency with respect to Taxes has been claimed,
proposed, asserted or assessed by any Governmental Authority against Seller or
any member of the Target Group with respect to material Taxes for which any
member of the Target Group may be liable (except for deficiencies or adjustments that have been settled, withdrawn or
fully satisfied by payment, in each case, with no liability for any member of
the Target Group), and no written notice thereof has been received. There are
no requests for rulings or similar determinations in respect of any material
Tax in respect of any member of the Target Group pending between Seller or any
member of the Target Group and any Governmental Authority.

(iv)There are no material Liens for Taxes upon any assets of any member of the
Target Group, other than statutory Liens for current Taxes not yet due and
payable.

(v)No member of the Target Group has any material liability for Taxes of
another Person under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Applicable Law), as a successor or
transferee. No member of the Target Group is party to any Tax sharing, Tax
indemnification, Tax allocation or similar agreement (other than any agreement
entered into in the ordinary course of business and no significant purpose of
which relates to Taxes) pursuant to which it will have any obligation to make
any payments after the Closing to any Person.

(vi)Neither Seller nor any member of the Target Group has waived any statute
of limitations in respect of material Taxes for which a member of the Target
Group may be liable, agreed to any extension of time for filing any Tax Return
that has not been filed (other than automatic extensions not requiring the
consent of any Governmental Authority), or agreed to any extension of time for
the assessment or collection of any Tax for which a member of the Target Group
may be liable, which waiver or extension remains in effect, and no request to
so waive or extend is outstanding.

item of income in, or exclude any material item of deduction from, taxable
income for any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date as a result of (i)
any change in method of accounting made prior to the Closing Date, (ii) use of
an improper method of accounting for a Tax period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date, (iii) any closing agreement described in Section 7121 of the
Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Applicable Law)
entered into prior to the Closing, (iv) any installment sale or open
transaction disposition made prior to the Closing, in each case, other than in
the ordinary course of business, (v) any deferred revenue accrued, or other
prepaid or advanced amount received, in each case, prior to the Closing, in
each case, other than in the ordinary course of business, or (vi) any election
under Section 108(i) of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Applicable Law).

(viii)No member of the Target Group has participated in any "listed
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.6011-4(b)(2).

(ix)Each member of the Target Group is, and has been at all times since its
formation, properly classified as an entity disregarded as separate from its
owner within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3(b). No
election has been made to classify any member of the Target Group as an association taxable as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

No representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that relates to
Taxes, other than Section 4.1(bb)(vii) above and Section 4.1(bb)(ix) above,
shall be deemed to apply directly or indirectly with respect to any taxable
period (or portion thereof) after the Closing Date and no representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement that relates to Taxes, shall be deemed to
apply regarding the existence, amount, expiration date or limitations on or
availability of any tax attributes of any member of the Target Group.

For purposes of this Agreement and any Closing Documents, whenever the phrases
"to the best of Seller's knowledge", or the "knowledge" of Seller or words of
similar import are used, they shall be deemed to mean, and shall be limited
to, and based solely upon, the knowledge, assuming reasonable independent
inquiry or investigation having been made, of the Seller Knowledge
Individuals. The Seller Knowledge Individuals will have no personal liability
under this Agreement or otherwise with respect to the Membership Interests or
the Property. Seller does not represent or warrant that any particular Hotel
Contract will be in force or effect as of the Closing Date or that any party
to a Hotel Contract (other than Seller or the applicable Hotel Owner) will not
be in default under its Hotel Contract as of the Closing Date, unless such
party's default arises from a breach by Seller of its obligations under this
Agreement.

Secton 4.2.Representations and Warranties of Buyer. Buyer makes the following
representations and warranties to Seller as of the Effective Date, each of
which shall be deemed remade as of the Closing Date:

(a)Formation; Binding Agreement. Buyer is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of its state of formation and is or will prior
to the Closing be duly qualified to transact business in each State in which
the Property is located; and the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and all Closing Documents to be executed and delivered by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement are within the organizational power of Buyer and
have been or will prior to the Closing be duly authorized.

(b)Bankruptcy Actions. Buyer has not filed any voluntary petition in
bankruptcy or suffered the filing of any involuntary petition by Buyer's
creditors or suffered the appointment of a receiver to take possession of any
of Buyer's property. As of the Closing Date, Buyer will have sufficient funds
to pay the Purchase Price and to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(c)Adverse Actions and Proceedings. Buyer has received no written notice of
any action or proceeding or litigation pending or threatened against Buyer
which Buyer reasonably expects would affect the validity or enforceability of
this Agreement or any of the Closing Documents to be executed and delivered by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

(d)Legal Counsel. Buyer (i) is an experienced investor, (ii) is represented by
competent counsel, and (iii) understands and accepts the terms and provisions
of this Agreement, including, without limitation, all releases, waivers, limitations, and
assumptions of risk and liability set forth in this Agreement.

Secton 4.3.OFAC. Buyer and Seller each represent and warrant to the other, and
to Escrow Agent, that (a) such Party is not knowingly acting, directly or
indirectly, for or on behalf of any person, group, entity or nation named by
any Executive Order or the United States Treasury Department as a terrorist,
"Specially Designated National and Blocked Person," or other banned or blocked
person, entity, or nation pursuant to any law that is enforced or administered
by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or engaging in, instigating or
facilitating this transaction for or on behalf of any such person, group,
entity or nation; (b) such Party is not engaging in this transaction, directly
or indirectly, in violation of any Applicable Law relating to drug
trafficking, money laundering or predicate crimes to money laundering; and (c)
none of the funds of such Party to be utilized in this transaction have been
or will be derived from any unlawful activity with the result that such Party
or the Membership Interests or the Property is subject to seizure, forfeiture
or other such remedy or that this Agreement or the transactions hereunder are
or will be in violation of law. The provisions of this Section 4.3 will
survive the Closing or any earlier termination of this Agreement.

Secton 4.4.Inaccuracy Discovered Prior to the Closing. Neither Party may rely
on any representation or warranty made by one Party (the "Maker") to the other
Party (the "Recipient") in this Agreement or in any Closing Document to the
extent that any Seller Knowledge Individual or any Buyer Knowledge Individual
has, receives or obtains actual knowledge prior to the Closing that such
representation or warranty was, is or has become inaccurate or incorrect in
any material respect (the "Inaccuracy"). If the Recipient determines prior to
or at the Closing that an Inaccuracy exists, then the Recipient will promptly
give written notice to the Maker of the Inaccuracy (such notice, an
"Inaccuracy Notice"). The Maker will have the right, but not the obligation,
to cure the Inaccuracy within fifteen (15) days of the Maker's receipt of an
Inaccuracy Notice (and if reasonably required, the Closing will be extended to
allow for such cure). If Seller is the Recipient, then regardless of whether
such cure is attempted or effected by Buyer and except as otherwise expressly
set forth in Section 6.2 hereof, Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving
Buyer written notice of Seller's termination of this Agreement within fifteen
(15) days following the end of Buyer's fifteen (15)-day cure period (but in
any event, prior to the Closing). If Seller elects to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the foregoing, (a) unless such termination arose for an Inaccuracy
that was not an intentional Inaccuracy the Deposit will be delivered to
Seller, (b) neither Party will have any further rights or obligations under
this Agreement except for Obligations Surviving Termination. If Seller does
not elect to so terminate this Agreement, Seller shall be conclusively deemed
to have elected to waive the Inaccuracy and all effects or consequences
thereof, and Buyer will have no liability whatsoever with respect to the
Inaccuracy. If Buyer is the Recipient, subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 5.3 hereof (including Section
5.3(b) hereof), Buyer shall be obligated to proceed to the Closing but
thereafter may assert a claim for breach of representation under Section
6.3(b) hereof without waiving its rights hereunder so long as Buyer has
notified Seller in writing of the Inaccuracy prior to the Closing and Seller
has not cured the Inaccuracy prior to the commencement by Buyer of any such
claim, subject to the aggregate Threshold Amount and the aggregate Maximum Amount set forth in Section 6.3(b) hereof. In furtherance of the foregoing,
each Party agrees that the Maker will have no liability with respect to any
representation or warranty to the extent that, prior to the Closing, the
Recipient has, receives or obtains actual knowledge of an Inaccuracy (from
whatever source, including, without limitation, from disclosure by or on
behalf of the Maker) and the Recipient nevertheless proceeds to close the
purchase or sale of the Membership Interests under this Agreement without
terminating this Agreement (in the case of Seller) or providing written notice
of such Inaccuracy (in the case of Buyer) as provided under this Section 4.4.

Secton 4.5.Survival of Representations and Warranties. Subject in all respects
to Section 4.4 above and except in the case of fraud, a Party may rely on any
representation or warranty made by the other Party in this Agreement or any
Closing Document only until (x) the date that is two (2) years following the
date of Closing with respect to the Fundamental Representations or the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.1(bb) and with respect
to representations and warranties made by Buyer in this Agreement or any
Closing Document or (y) until the date that is six (6) months following the
date of the Closing with respect to all other representations and warranties
made by Seller or Buyer in this Agreement or any Closing Document (each such
date described in clause (x) and clause (y), each, an "Expiration Date"). Any
Claims for, relating to or arising from an Inaccuracy are limited in all
respects to any actual damages the Recipient sustained from the Recipient's
reasonable reliance upon the representation or warranty. In no event will
either Party be liable to the other Party for any consequential, special or
punitive damages suffered by a Party as a result of any Inaccuracy, except, in
the case of consequential damages, to the extent they were reasonably
foreseeable if and solely to the extent the applicable jurisdiction
characterizes foreseeable consequential damages as "actual" damages. If an
Inaccuracy is discovered after the Closing and the Recipient desires to pursue
any remedy against the Maker with respect to such Inaccuracy, then the
Recipient must give the Maker a Claim Notice detailing the Inaccuracy upon or
prior to the applicable Expiration Date. Any Claims that a Recipient might
otherwise have or have had against a Maker with respect to any Inaccuracy,
whether such Inaccuracy or such Claims are known or unknown, will not be valid
or effective if a Claim Notice detailing the Inaccuracy has not been given to
the Maker on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, on the applicable Expiration Date, each Party shall be deemed to be
fully discharged and released (without the need for separate releases or other
documentation) from any liability or obligation to the other Party (and to all
its Affiliates) with respect to any Inaccuracy, known or unknown, not detailed
in a Claim Notice delivered to the other Party on or prior to the applicable
Expiration Date. Further, any Claims that either Party may have at any time
against the other Party for any matter with respect to which a Claim Notice
has been given to the other Party on or prior to the applicable Expiration
Date may be the subject of subsequent litigation brought by the claiming
Party, but only if such litigation is commenced against and duly served upon
the other Party on or prior to the date that is ninety (90) days following the
applicable Expiration Date (the "Claim Bar Date"). For the avoidance of doubt,
on the Claim Bar Date, each Party shall be deemed to be fully discharged and
released (without the need for separate releases or other documentation) from
any liability or obligation to the other Party with respect to any Claim,
known or unknown, except for any Claim for which both (a) a Claim Notice was
timely delivered as provided above, and (b) litigation upon the Claim has been
commenced by the claiming Party and duly served upon the other Party prior to or upon the Claim
Bar Date, except as otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing or in the case
of fraud. This Section 4.5 (and Section 4.4 above) collectively provide the
sole remedies of each Party with respect to any Inaccuracy and each Party
expressly waives any other rights or remedies such Party might otherwise have
at law or in equity with respect to any Inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty of the other Party.

ARTICLE 5

provided, however, if any Loan Release and Modification, Franchisor's Consent,
Marriott Manager's Consent or Ground Lessor's Consent is not obtained by the

faith to effectuate a Closing, each of Buyer and Seller shall have a one-time
right to elect to extend the Closing Date with respect to the Membership
Interests for the applicable Hotel Portfolios for which the same has not been
obtained to the Consent Approval Outside Date in order to continue to seek the
same, so long as such Party delivers written notice to the other Parties of
its election to extend at least one (1) Business Day prior to the Consent

made by Buyer in Article 4 above shall be true and correct in all material
respects when made and on and as of the Closing Date (except for any such

specified date or dates), and Seller shall have received a certificate to that
effect dated as of the Closing Date and signed by an officer of Buyer.

without further action of any party (and no Party shall have any further

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any of the conditions are not satisfied

frustrating any closing condition, then Seller shall have the right to
exercise the remedies set forth in Section 6.2 hereof.

in Section 4.1(w)(b) above shall be true and correct in all respects when made

set forth in Section 6.1 hereof.

Unless specifically set forth herein to the contrary, Seller shall not be

allocation/apportionment of such costs in the jurisdiction in which such
applicable Individual Hotel is located, unless otherwise agreed to by the
Parties in writing. The provisions of this Section 5.5 will survive the
Closing or any earlier termination of this Agreement.

Section 5.6.Brokers. The Parties acknowledge the involvement in this
transaction of the "Seller's Broker" named as such in the Summary of Terms
("Seller's Broker"), whose commission if the Closing occurs will be the
responsibility of Seller pursuant to a separate agreement between Seller's
Broker and Seller. Except for Seller's Broker, Buyer and Seller each state and
confirm to the other that no broker, finder or comparable Person was utilized
in arranging or bringing about this transaction and that there are no claims
or rights for brokerage fees, commissions, finders' fees, or comparable fees
or compensation due to any other Person in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If any other Person asserts a claim for a
commission, fee or other compensation based upon any contact, dealings or
communication with Buyer or Seller, then the Party through whom such Person
makes its claim will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party from
such claim and any and all costs, damages, liabilities or expenses (including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by
the other Party in connection with such claim. This Section 5.6 is intended
only to set forth the agreements of the Parties and in no event shall Seller's deemed to be a third-party beneficiary of, or have any rights or obligations
under, this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 5.6 will survive the
Closing or any earlier termination of this Agreement.

Section 5.7.Tax Matters.

(a)Transfer Taxes Tax Returns. Buyer shall prepare and timely file all Tax
Returns and other documentation relating to Transfer Taxes as may be required
under Applicable Law. Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in
connection with such preparation and filing by Buyer (including by joining in
the execution of any such Tax Return to the extent required under Applicable
Law).

(b)Tax Returns. So long as Seller or its Affiliates would reasonably be
expected to have any Tax liability for or with respect to any tax period (or
portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date or an obligations to
indemnify Buyer with respect to material Taxes under this Agreement, Buyer
shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing for the avoidance of doubt, the members of Target Group) to, in each
case to the extent relating in whole or in part to any member of the Target
Group, (a) amend, refile or otherwise modify any material Tax Return for any
tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, (b)
extend or waive, or cause to be extended or waived, any statute of limitations
or other tax period for the assessment of any material Tax or material
deficiency for Taxes related for any tax period (or portion thereof) ending on
or before the Closing Date, (c) make or change any material Tax election or
accounting method or practice with respect to, or that has retroactive effect
to, for any tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing
Date, (d) enter into any voluntary disclosure agreement or similar process
with respect to Taxes for any tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or
before the Closing Date, in each case, without the prior written consent of
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(c)Tax Proceedings. If, after the Closing Date, Buyer or Seller or any of
their Affiliates, including any member of the Target Group receives notice of
a claim, action, suit, arbitration, inquiry, audit, examination, proceeding or
investigation by or before any Governmental Authority relating to the Taxes or
Tax Returns of or with respect to any member of Target Group for any tax
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date or if Seller
may be liable under this Agreement or would reasonably be expected to be
liable otherwise for any resulting Taxes (each, a "Tax Contest"), then within
ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, the Party in initial receipt of
such notice shall notify the other party in writing thereof. With respect to
any Tax Contest for which Seller may be liable under this Agreement or would
reasonably be expected to be liable otherwise for any resulting Taxes, so long
as Buyer will be indemnified by Seller for the full amount of any and all
Claims arising from such Tax Contest Seller may elect to control the conduct
and resolution of any such Tax Contest by delivering to Buyer written notice
of Seller's election to control within ten (10) days after receipt of such Tax
Contest; provided, that Seller (i) shall conduct the Tax Contest in good
faith; (ii) shall keep Buyer reasonably informed regarding the status of such
Tax Contest; (iii) shall allow Buyer to participate in such Tax Contest at
Buyer's own expense and (iv) shall not settle any such Tax Contest (or portion thereof) without the prior written consent of
Buyer, which consent shall not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Should Seller not elect to control such Tax Contest or does not have
a right to control such Tax Contest but may be liable under this Agreement or
would reasonably be expected to be liable otherwise for any resulting Taxes,
Buyer shall control such Tax Contest; provided that Buyer (i) shall conduct
the Tax Contest in good faith; (ii) shall keep Seller reasonably informed
regarding the status of such Tax Contest; (iii) shall allow Seller to
participate in such Tax Contest at Seller's own expense and (iv) shall not
(and shall not allow any member of the Target Group to) settle any such Tax
Contest (or portion thereof) without the prior written consent of Seller,
which consent shall not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 5.8.Tax Appeal Proceedings. Seller (or the applicable Hotel Owner or
Operating Tenant) may (or cause any Hotel Owner or Operating Tenant to)
commence without Buyer's approval or consultation any new real property tax
appeals or protests or settle or compromise any ongoing tax appeals or
protests, with respect to real property taxes due and payable for the tax year
prior to the year in which the Closing Date occurs and/or the tax year in
which the Closing Date occurs. The net proceeds from any proceedings for real
property taxes due and payable in the tax year in which the Closing Date
occurs shall be deposited into the Acquired Accounts, subject to the terms of
the Loan Documents. This Section 5.8 shall survive the Closing or earlier
termination of this Agreement.

Section 5.9.Transition Services. From and after the Closing Date until April
30, 2021 (or such other date as may be agreed to by the Parties) (such period,
the "TSA Term"), Seller or its Affiliate will provide to Buyer transition
services related to the preparation of the 2020 and 2021 audits for the Target
Group, on customary terms to be agreed prior to the Closing Date, which terms
shall (i) include that such services may be freely terminable by Buyer on
thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Seller and (ii) be consistent with
the proposal provided by Seller to Buyer prior to the Effective Date and
otherwise mutually acceptable to the Parties. This Section 5.9 shall survive
the Closing.

ARTICLE 6

DEFAULT; REMEDIES

Section 6.1.Default by Seller. If Seller fails to perform any material
obligation of Seller under this Agreement prior to or at the Closing and does
not cure such failure within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice
from Buyer asserting such failure (such failure, if not cured within such
period, being a "Seller Default"), then Buyer will be entitled to elect no
later than sixty (60) days after the occurrence of such Seller Default, as
Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy against Seller, either to (a) terminate this
Agreement and receive (i) a return of the Deposit, (ii) reimbursement by
Seller of an amount equal to Buyer's Transaction Expenses (which amount shall
be as set forth in a written notice provided by Buyer to Seller), and (iii)
payment of a fee in the amount of Ten Million and No/100 Dollars
($10,000,000.00) (the "Termination Fee"), and, except for Obligations
Surviving Termination, neither of the Parties will have any further liability
or obligation under this Agreement, or (b) seek specific performance against
Seller to compel Seller to perform any such material obligations, including Seller's obligation to convey the Membership Interests to Buyer as required
under this Agreement; provided, however, that as a condition precedent to
Buyer's pursuit of any action for specific performance, Buyer (i) must not
then be in material breach of any of Buyer's obligations under this Agreement
and (ii) must maintain the full Deposit in escrow until and during the
pendency of such action. Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to terminate
this Agreement (as provided in clause (a) above) if Buyer does not file and
serve Seller with a lawsuit asserting such cause of action within the
foregoing sixty (60)-day period. The Parties have agreed that Buyer's actual
damages in the event of a Seller Default would be extremely difficult or
impracticable to determine. The Parties have therefore agreed that,
considering all the facts and circumstances existing as of the Effective Date,
if Buyer exercises its right under clause (a) above, the amount of the
Termination Fee, together with the amount of Buyer's Transaction Expenses and
the Deposit, is a reasonable estimate of the damages that Buyer would incur in
the event of a Seller Default. Each Party specifically confirms the accuracy
of the statements made above and the fact that each Party was represented by
counsel who explained, at the time this Agreement was made, the consequences
of this liquidated damages provision. The obligations of Seller under clause
(a) above in this Section 6.1 shall survive the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to clause (a) above.

Section 6.2.Default by Buyer. If Buyer fails to perform any material
obligation of Buyer under this Agreement prior to or at the Closing and, with
respect to any default other than a default of the obligation to effectuate
the Closing (for which there shall be no cure period), does not cure such
failure (a) within three (3) Business Days after receipt of written notice
from Seller asserting such failure, if Buyer fails to timely pay or deposit
any amount of money required to be paid or deposited by Buyer under this
Agreement, or (b) within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice
from Seller asserting such failure (such failure, if not cured within such
period, being a "Buyer Default"), then Seller will be entitled, as Seller's
sole and exclusive remedy against Buyer, to terminate this Agreement and
receive the Deposit. The Parties have agreed that Seller's actual damages in
the event of a Buyer Default would be extremely difficult or impracticable to
determine. The Parties have therefore agreed that, considering all the facts
and circumstances existing as of the Effective Date, the amount of the Deposit
is a reasonable estimate of the damages that Seller would incur in the event
of a Buyer Default. Each Party specifically confirms the accuracy of the
statements made above and the fact that each Party was represented by counsel
who explained, at the time this Agreement was made, the consequences of this
liquidated damages provision. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall
limit or prevent Seller from enforcing Buyer's obligations and liabilities
hereunder which are expressly stated to survive the termination of this
Agreement.

Section 6.3.Limitations on Liability.

(a)Unless otherwise expressly stated in this Agreement, the provisions of
Sections 6.1 and 6.2 above provide each Party's sole remedies for any failure
by the other Party to perform its respective obligations under this Agreement
prior to or at the Closing, but will not limit any rights or remedies that
either Party may have for a breach or default by the other Party after the
Closing with respect to those provisions of this Agreement, or those
provisions of the Closing Documents, which are expressly stated to survive the
Closing. However, in no event will either Party be liable to the other Party for any consequential, special or
punitive damages suffered by a Party as a result of any failure, breach or
default, either before or after the Closing, by the other Party under this
Agreement or any of the Closing Documents, and each Party expressly waives any
right to recover any consequential, special or punitive damages caused to such
Party by the other Party, except, in the case of consequential damages, to the
extent they were reasonably foreseeable if and solely to the extent the
applicable jurisdiction characterizes foreseeable consequential damages as
"actual" damages.

(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or any
of the Closing Documents, (i) except in the case of fraud, Seller and the
Seller Parties will have no liability whatsoever with respect to any Claims
suffered or incurred by, asserted or assessed against, or imposed upon Buyer
or any Buyer Party under or with respect to this Agreement, the Membership
Interests, the Property, or any Closing Document, except to the extent (and
only to the extent) that the aggregate amount of such Claims exceeds the
Threshold Amount; and (ii) except in the case of fraud or for any breach of,
or inaccuracy in, any Seller Fundamental Representation or Section 4.1(z)
above, in no event will the total aggregate liability of Seller and any Seller
Parties for any or all Claims with respect to the Membership Interests of any
Hotel Owner and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Closing Documents exceed the Maximum Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, any
"material", "in all material respects", "Material Adverse Effect" or similar
qualifier will be disregarded for purposes of determining whether there is a
breach, Inaccuracy or failure of any representation and warranty contained in
Section 4.1 or Section 4.2 to be true and correct and the losses resulting
from or arising out of or relating to such breach or Inaccuracy, including for
purposes of Section 4.4 above.

(c)As security for any Claims made by Buyer against Seller following the
Closing in accordance with this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Seller shall,
at Seller's election, (x) deposit or cause to be deposited a portion of the
Purchase Price in an amount equal to the Maximum Amount (the "Escrow Holdback
Funds"), (y) deliver to Escrow Agent a letter of credit in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Buyer from a financial institution reasonably
acceptable to Buyer (a "Letter of Credit"), or (z) cause one more guaranties
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer from one or more
creditworthy entities proposed by Seller and reasonably acceptable to Buyer to
be executed and delivered to Buyer (each, a "Post-Closing Guaranty"), which
Post-Closing Guaranties shall only survive for six (6) months following the
Closing (or longer if a Claim is pending). If Seller elects either clause (x)
or clause (y) above, then the Escrow Holdback Funds or Letter of Credit, as
the case may be, shall be held by Escrow Agent until the six (6)-month
anniversary of the Closing Date and the portion of Escrow Holdback Funds or
Letter of Credit that remains held by Escrow Agent (less any amount that is
the subject of an unresolved Claim between Buyer and Seller) shall be
disbursed by Escrow Agent to Seller. To the extent any such post-Closing claim
is paid from the Escrow Holdback Funds or the Letter of Credit during the six
(6)-month period after the Closing Date, Seller will not be obligated to
replenish such amount or deliver or deposit any replacement Letter of Credit.
To the extent any such post-Closing claim is paid from a source other than the
Escrow Holdback Funds or the Letter of Credit during the six (6)-month period
after the Closing Date, the amount of the required Escrow Holdback Funds or
the Letter of Credit, as the case may be, will be reduced proportionately. For
the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Escrow Holdback Funds and the Letter of Credit shall only be held by
Escrow Agent until the six (6)-month anniversary of the Closing Date (or
longer if a Claim is pending), notwithstanding that the Expiration Date with
respect to certain covenants, indemnities, warranties and representations of
Seller that expressly survive the Closing is two (2) years after the Closing.

Section 6.4.Survival. The terms, provisions and limitations of this Article 6
will survive the Closing or any earlier termination of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 7

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 7.1.Notices. Any notices required or permitted to be given under this
Agreement must be given in writing and delivered to the recipient's notice
address as provided in this Agreement either (a) in person, (b) by certified
mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, (c) by a commercial overnight
courier that guarantees next Business Day delivery and provides a delivery
confirmation to the sender, or (d) by email; provided that, any emailed notice
purporting to either terminate this Agreement or provide notice of an asserted
failure, breach or default by the other Party must be followed by a hard copy
thereof given within one (1) Business Day thereafter which is delivered in
accordance with one of the preceding subsections (a) - (c), unless receipt of
such hard copy is expressly waived by a reply email from the recipient Party
in response to such notice email. The notice addresses for the Parties are as
set forth in the Summary of Terms. Either Party may specify a different or
additional domestic (United States) notice address for itself as such Party
may from time to time desire by giving notice thereof in writing as provided
above to the other Party. If sent by email, a notice shall be deemed given
upon the date when such email is transmitted by the sending Party to the
receiving Party's notice address, and shall be deemed received on that same
date unless such notice is transmitted by the sender after 5:00 p.m. in the
local time of the physical address of the receiving Party, in which case
receipt by the receiving Party shall be deemed to be upon the next Business
Day. If personally delivered, a notice shall be deemed given and received upon
the date of such delivery. If sent by overnight courier service, a notice
shall be deemed given upon the date of deposit with such courier and deemed
received upon the date of delivery or refusal of delivery at the notice
address. If sent by certified mail, a notice shall be deemed given and
received on the third (3rd) Business Day after deposit into the US Mail.
Notices from or signed by the legal counsel for a Party will be equally
effective as a notice from such Party itself.

Section 7.2.Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto, the Closing Documents, and any other letter agreement the
Parties are entering into on or around the Effective Date, contains all
agreements, representations, warranties and covenants made by Buyer and Seller
and constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties with respect to
the purchase and sale of the Membership Interests. All Exhibits and Schedules
to this Agreement are fully incorporated as a part of this Agreement. Any
prior correspondence, memoranda, letters of intent, or other agreements
between the Parties, including, without limitation, any oral or written
statements made by the Seller Parties or the Buyer Parties, are not binding on
or enforceable against either Party, and are entirely superseded and replaced Agreement; provided, however, that the Confidentiality Agreement will remain
in full force and effect and will not be superseded by this Agreement.

Section 7.3.Time. Time is of the essence in the performance of each of the
Parties' respective obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that
if a deadline or date for performance, or for the giving or receipt of a
notice, falls on a day which is not a Business Day, such deadline or date
shall be deemed extended to the next Business Day.

Section 7.4.Attorneys' Fees. In addition to the remedies provided in Article 6
above, if there is any litigation, action or other proceeding between the
Parties, including, without limitation, any bankruptcy or appeal ("Action"),
to enforce any provisions or rights arising under or in connection with this
Agreement or the Closing Documents, the Party which is determined to have
prevailed in such Action shall be entitled to an award against the non-
prevailing Party for all costs and expenses, including, but not limited to,
reasonable attorneys' fees, reasonably incurred by the prevailing Party in
connection with such Action. The provisions of this Section 7.4 will survive
the Closing or any earlier termination of this Agreement.

Section 7.5.Merger of Obligations. Obligations which are expressly provided in
this Agreement to survive or be performed after the Closing will not merge
with the transfer of the Membership Interests but will remain in effect until
fulfilled; all other obligations of the Parties will merge with and be
extinguished upon the transfer of the Membership Interests to Buyer at the
Closing.

Section 7.6.Assignment. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns; provided that no Party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer
this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, in
whole or in part, without the prior written consent of each other Party
hereto. Any attempted assignment, delegation or transfer in violation of this
Section 7.6 shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall
have the right, by written notice given to Seller not less than thirty (30)
days after the Effective Date, to (i) designate one or more Affiliates or
other Persons with whom Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer will enter into a
joint venture (or any Affiliates of such joint venture) as its nominee to
receive some or all of the Membership Interests, and/or assign (ii) all of its
right, title and interest in this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any
Affiliate or to any Person with whom Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer will
enter into a joint venture to purchase the Individual Hotels so long as such
Affiliate or such joint venture has assumed in writing all obligations of
Buyer under this Agreement; provided, however, that (a) such Affiliate (or any
Affiliates of such joint venture) remains an Affiliate of Buyer or such Person
remains a joint venture partner of Buyer or its Affiliate as of the Closing,
and (b) Buyer shall remain jointly and severally liable under this Agreement
unless and until the Closing occurs and in no event shall Buyer be released
prior to the Closing from any of its obligations under this Agreement by
reason of any such assignments.

Section 7.7.Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK, EXCEPT AS TO REAL PROPERTY MATTERS DIRECTLY RELATED TO A SINGLE
INDIVIDUAL HOTEL, WHICH MATTERS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE RESPECTIVE REAL PROPERTY OF
SUCH INDIVIDUAL HOTEL IS LOCATED (the "Property State"). For the purposes of
any suit, action or proceeding involving this Agreement, each Party expressly
submits to the jurisdiction of all federal and state courts sitting in the
State of New York and consents that any order, process, notice of motion or
other application to or by any such court or a judge thereof may be served
within or without such court's jurisdiction by registered mail or by personal
service, provided that, a reasonable time for appearance is allowed, and each
Party agrees that such courts will have jurisdiction over any such suit,
action or proceeding commenced by any Party. Each Party irrevocably waives any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
brought in any federal or state court sitting in the State of New York and
further irrevocably waives any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. The
foregoing provisions are not intended to establish the State of New York as
the exclusive forum for any suit, action or proceeding involving this
Agreement, but merely to establish the consent and agreement of each Party to
such non-exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the event of any contest or
dispute over such matters.

Section 7.8.Waiver of Trial by Jury. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER
APPLICABLE LAW, EACH PARTY WAIVES, IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION BROUGHT ON, UNDER OR BY VIRTUE OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO
THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE CLOSING DOCUMENTS, THE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS, THE
PROPERTY, OR ANY CLAIMS OR ACTIONS PERTAINING TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING.

Section 7.9.Interpretation of Agreement. Except as otherwise specifically
indicated, all references in this Agreement to Article and Section numbers
refer to Article and Sections of this Agreement, and all references to
Exhibits refer to the Exhibits attached hereto. Unless otherwise expressly
stated, the words "herein", "hereof", "hereby", "hereunder", "hereinafter",
and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular Article or Section hereof. Any of the terms defined herein may,
unless the content otherwise requires, be used in the singular or the plural
depending on the reference. All words or terms used in this Agreement,
regardless of the number or gender in which they are used, shall include any
other number or gender, as the context may require. References to contracts,
agreements and other contractual instruments shall be deemed to include all
subsequent amendments, supplements and other modifications thereto, but only
to the extent such amendments, supplements and other modifications are not
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. The terms "including" means
"including, without limitation", except where the context otherwise requires.
References to specific statutes include (i) any and all amendments and
modifications thereto in effect at the time in question, (ii) successor
statutes of similar purpose and import and (iii) all rules, regulations and
orders promulgated thereunder. The term "commercially reasonable efforts"
means the efforts undertaken by a party without such party expending more than
a de minimis amount of money or incurring more than de minimis obligations.
All monetary amounts expressed in "dollars" or designated by a "$", "USD" or
"US$" symbol or abbreviation refer to a monetary amount payable within the
United States in the current lawful, dollar-denominated official currency of the United States of America. The captions and paragraph
headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall in no
way enlarge or limit the scope or meaning of any part of this Agreement. The
terms and provisions of this Agreement represent the result of negotiations by
the Parties, and each Party has been represented by counsel of, and to the
extent of, such Party's own choosing, and neither Party has acted under any
duress or compulsion, whether legal, economic or otherwise. Consequently, the
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in
accordance with their usual and customary meanings, and the Parties each waive
the application of any rule of law which might otherwise be applicable that
ambiguous or conflicting terms or provisions contained in this Agreement shall
be interpreted or construed against the Party that prepared (or whose attorney
prepared) the executed Agreement or any earlier draft of this Agreement or the
provision in question.

Section 7.10.Amendments; No Waiver. No modification, waiver, amendment or
discharge of or under this Agreement will be valid unless contained in a
writing signed by the Party against whom enforcement is sought. No waiver by
Seller or Buyer of a breach of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of
this Agreement will be construed or held to be a waiver of any succeeding or
preceding breach of the same or any other term, covenant or condition
contained in this Agreement.

Section 7.11.No Recording. Neither this Agreement nor any memorandum or short
form thereof may be recorded by Buyer or any Buyer Party. Any such recording
of this Agreement or a memorandum or short form hereof by Buyer or any Buyer
Party will constitute an immediate Buyer Default under this Agreement (except
if done so in connection with Buyer's pursuit of specific performance in
accordance with Section 6.1 above), and in addition to Seller's other remedies
therefor, Seller may conclusively establish the complete release and removal
of such recorded document simply by recording a copy of this provision of this
Agreement.

Section 7.12.No Third Party Beneficiary. Except as may be expressly stated
herein, the provisions of this Agreement do not and are not intended to
benefit any third parties.

Section 7.13.Severability. If, in any action to enforce this Agreement, any
one or more of the covenants, agreements, conditions, provisions, or terms of
this Agreement is, in any respect or to any extent (in whole or in part), held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, all remaining portions
thereof which are not so held, and all other covenants, agreements,
conditions, provisions, and terms of this Agreement, will not be affected by
such holding, but will remain valid and in force to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

Section 7.14.Drafts Not an Offer. The submission of a draft of this Agreement
by one Party to another is not intended by either Party to be an offer to
enter into a legally binding contract with respect to the purchase and sale of
the Membership Interests. The Parties will not be legally bound in any manner
with respect to a purchase and sale of the Membership Interests unless and
until each of Seller and Buyer have duly executed this Agreement and the
Parties have delivered that fully executed Agreement to Escrow Agent. Section 7.15.Consent Standards. Unless expressly provided otherwise in this
Agreement, any consent, determination, election or approval required to be
obtained, or permitted to be given, by or on behalf of either Party under this
Agreement will be given, withheld or made (as the case may be) by such Party
in the exercise of such Party's commercially reasonable discretion and within
a commercially reasonable period of time.

Section 7.16.Counterparts; Signatures. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which taken together will constitute one and the same Agreement. Signatures to
this Agreement transmitted by facsimile, sent by email (including ".pdf"), or
delivered by other electronic means will be valid and effective to bind the
Party so signing. Each Party agrees to promptly deliver a "hard copy" of this
Agreement bearing such Party's original manual ink signature to the other
Party upon request, but a failure to do so will not affect the enforceability
of this Agreement.

Section 7.17.Publicity. Neither Party will issue, or cause or permit its
Affiliates to issue, any press release or public statement with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement which expressly names the other
Party or any of its Affiliates (a "Press Release") without the prior written
consent of the other Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If either Party desires to issue a Press Release
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, then prior to any issuance
such Party will give a copy of the proposed Press Release to the other Party
for its review, comment and approval. If no objection or comments are received
from the other Party within three (3) Business Days after the other Party
receives such proposed Press Release for review, consent to the Press Release
shall be deemed given by the reviewing Party. The term "Press Release" shall
expressly exclude any press release or public statement required by Applicable
Law, the rules of any stock exchange on which the securities of a Party (or
its direct or indirect partners, members or shareholders) are listed, or any
other regulation applicable to a Party. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller
shall be permitted, without the prior consent of Buyer, but subject to prior
notice to, and reasonable consultation with, Buyer, to file this Agreement (or
a description thereof) with and in accordance with the rules of any stock
exchange on which the securities of Seller (or its direct or indirect
partners, members or shareholders) are listed. The provisions of this Section
7.17 shall survive the Closing or any earlier termination of this Agreement.

Section 7.18.Further Instruments and Acts. The Parties shall execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such additional instruments,
assignments, assurances, certificates and documents, and shall do such further
acts, as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this
Agreement, but only so long as any such additional instruments, assignments,
assurances, certificates and documents and further acts have no more than a de
minimis effect on either Party's rights or obligations hereunder. This Section
7.18 shall survive the Closing.

Section 7.19.Access. Buyer agrees to preserve all Hotel Books and Records and
not to destroy or dispose of the same for at least five (5) years after the
Closing Date, and then only after sixty (60) days prior written notice to
Seller. Seller shall have reasonable access during normal business hours and
with reasonable prior written notice to Buyer to the Hotel Books and Records during the five (5)-year period and until the end of such sixty
(60)-day period, to the extent reasonably necessary for its tax and accounting
purposes; provided that Seller shall not have access to any Hotel Books and
Records to the extent the disclosure of such Hotel Books and Records would
reasonably be expected to violate any Applicable Law or result in the waiver
of any legal privilege, attorney-client privilege or work-product privilege.
Buyer agrees to provide access to Seller and its representatives to such
books, records, correspondence and files at all reasonable times during such
five (5)-year period and until the end of such sixty (60)-day period for their
review and/or photocopying. This Section 7.19 shall survive the Closing or
termination of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 8

STATE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS

Section 8.1.Florida.

(a)Radon Gas Disclosure. Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas which,
when it has accumulated in a building in sufficient quantities, may present
health risks to persons who are exposed to it over time. Levels of radon which
exceed federal and state guidelines have been found in buildings in the states
in which the Individual Hotels are located. Additional information regarding
radon and radon testing may be obtained from the county public health unit.

(b)Mold Disclosure. Mold and/or other microscopic organisms can be found
almost anywhere. They occur naturally in the environment and can grow on
virtually any organic substance as long as moisture and oxygen are present.
Mold and/or other microscopic organisms may cause property damage and/or
health problems. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller shall not be
responsible for any Claims arising out of or relating to mold and/or other
microscopic organisms at the Property including but not limited to property
damages, personal injury, adverse health effects, loss of income, emotional

the State of Louisiana, the following words as used in this Agreement will be

(a)All references to "real property" and "real estate" will include "immovable

that term is used in the Louisiana Civil Code.

(c)All references to "tangible property" will include "corporeal property" as
that term is used in the Louisiana Civil Code.

(d)All references to "intangible property" will include "incorporeal property"
as that term is used in the Louisiana Civil Code.

(e)All references to "buildings" will include "other constructions" as that
term is used in the Louisiana Civil Code.

(f)All references to "liens" will include "privileges," as that term is used
in the Louisiana Civil Code.

(g)All references to a "receiver" will include a "keeper" under La. R. S.
9:5136, et seq.

(h)All references to "condemnation" will include "expropriation" as that term
is used in Louisiana law.

(i)All references to "easements" will include "servitudes" as used in the
Louisiana Civil Code.

(j)All references to "county" as a political subdivision in Louisiana will

(k)The term "fee owner" will mean "owner with full ownership interest" as that

Section 8.4.New Hampshire. By its execution hereof, Buyer acknowledges receipt
of the following notification:

(a)Radon, the product of decay of radioactive materials in rock, may be found
in some areas of New Hampshire. Radon gas may pass into a structure through
the ground or through water from a deep well. Testing of the air by a
professional certified in radon testing and testing of the water by an
accredited laboratory can establish radon's presence and equipment is
available to remove it from the air or water.

(b)Arsenic is a common groundwater contaminant in New Hampshire that occurs at
unhealthy levels in well water in many areas of the state. Tests are available
to determine whether arsenic is present at unsafe levels, and equipment is
available to remove it from water. Buyer is encouraged to consult the New
Hampshire department of environmental services private well testing
recommendations (www.des.nh.gov) to ensure a safe water supply if the subject
Property is served by a private well. (c)Before 1978, paint containing lead may have been used in structures.
Exposure to lead from the presence of flaking, chalking, chipping lead paint
or lead paint dust from friction surfaces, or from the disturbance of intact
surfaces containing lead paint through unsafe renovation, repair or painting
practices, or from soils in close proximity to the building, can present a
serious health hazard, especially to young children and pregnant women. Lead
may also be present in drinking water as a result of lead in service lines,
plumbing and fixtures. Tests are available to determine whether lead is
present in paint or drinking water.

(d)Nothing in this Section 8.4 shall be construed to have any impact on the
legal validity of title to the Property indirectly transferred pursuant to
this Agreement, or to create or place any liability with Seller or Seller's
agent for failure to provide the notification described in this Section 8.4.

Section 8.5.New Jersey. Seller shall cooperate in providing the information
needed so that Buyer can file and serve the notice required by N.J.S.A.
54:50-38 et seq., and any other applicable state statute, concerning this
impending sale of commercial real property, including notice to the Bulk Sales
Unit of the State of New Jersey, Division of Taxation (the "Division"), and
Seller agrees to fully comply with N.J.S.A. 54:50-38 et seq. and applicable
statutes. Such cooperation shall include promptly supplying to Buyer the
information requested of Seller on the State form known as the "Notification
of Sale, Transfer, or Assignment in Bulk," and any other and additional
information that may be reasonably requested by the Division, such as, for
example, the information requested in any Asset Transfer Tax Declaration form.
Buyer and Seller acknowledge that it is within the authority of the Division
to direct that funds from the Acquired Accounts applicable to any of the
Individual Hotels located in the state of New Jersey (or from the Purchase
Price if there are insufficient funds in such applicable Acquired Accounts) be
placed into escrow at Closing. Buyer and Seller agree to abide by all
notifications of the Division. Buyer and Seller agree that in the event that
such an escrow is required by the State of New Jersey, Escrow Agent shall act
as escrow holder in connection with any required escrow. The escrow monies
will be held in escrow in a non-interest bearing account until the Division
makes a final determination as to the amount of any State taxes owed by
Seller, and the escrow monies will be released in accordance with, and only
upon receipt of, a Tax Clearance Letter from the Division. Escrow Agent shall
be authorized to pay to the State of New Jersey such amounts as may be
ultimately determined by the Division to be due and owing. In no event shall
Buyer be required to complete the Closing until such time as the Division has
issued a Tax Clearance Letter. If the amount of the escrow directed to be held
by the Division shall exceed the amount of the sale proceeds otherwise to be
paid to Seller at Closing, then Buyer shall fund the balance of the escrow
amount from funds in the Acquired Accounts applicable to any of the Individual
Hotels located in the State of New Jersey (or from the Purchase Price if there
are insufficient funds in such applicable Acquired Accounts).

Section 8.6.Washington. This Section 8.6 is specific to the State of
Washington and is, therefore, limited accordingly:

(a)The documents to be delivered by Seller as described in Section 5.4(a)
above include a Real Estate Excise Tax Affidavit Controlling Interest Transfer
Return as required in Chapter 82.45 of the Revised Code of Washington and Chapter 458-61A of the
Washington Administrative Code (the "REETA") for each Real Property owned by a
Hotel Owner that is located in Washington State.

(b)The documents to be delivered by Buyer as described in Section 5.4(b) above
include a REETA for each Real Property owned by a Hotel Owner that is located
in Washington State.

Section 8.7.Massachusetts.

(a)In the event of any inconsistencies between the terms and conditions of
this Section 8.7 and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
terms and conditions of this Section 8.7 shall control and be binding.

(b)Section 5.4(a)(xvi) above shall be deemed to include, with respect to any
business operating at any Individual Hotel located in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, to include (i) a Certificate of Good Standing from the
Massachusetts Department of Revenue (the "Tax Good Standing Certificate") and
(ii) a Certificate of Compliance from the Massachusetts Department of
Unemployment Assistance (the "DUA Compliance Certificate"), in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer. If any governmental authority
notifies Seller prior to the Closing that any sales taxes are due and payable
from Seller in connection with obtaining the Tax Good Standing Certificate or
any payments or contributions are due from Seller in connection with obtaining
the DUA Compliance Certificate, Seller shall pay such amounts directly to the
applicable governmental authority at or before the Closing using funds in the
Acquired Accounts applicable to any of the Individual Hotels located in the
State of Massachusetts (or from the Purchase Price if there are insufficient
funds in such applicable Acquired Account) and provide evidence of such
payment to Buyer.
