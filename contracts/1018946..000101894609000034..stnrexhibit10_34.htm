"<U>Net Working Capital</U>" means the consolidated current assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries, reduced by the consolidated current liabilities of the Company and the Subsidiaries, in each case as determined in accordance with the accounting principles set forth on <U>Schedule 2.4(a)</U> (the "<U>Agreed Principles</U>"), and excluding assets and liabilities in respect of Taxes (other than real and personal property Taxes, which shall be included in Net Working Capital).

The Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to <U>Section 2.4(b)</U>.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>If a notice of disagreement shall have been duly delivered pursuant to <U>Section 2.4(c)</U>, the Purchaser and the Seller shall, during the 15 days following such delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing Working Capital.  If during such period, the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause RSM McGladrey or such other independent accounting firm, as the case may be, the "<U>Independent Accountant</U>") to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing Working Capital (it being understood that in making such calculation, the Independent Accountant shall be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator).  Each of the Purchaser and the Seller agree that it shall not engage, or agree to engage the Independent Accountant to perform any services other than as the Independent Accountant pursuant hereto until the Closing Statement and Final Working Capital (as defined below) have been finally determined pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;2.4</U>.  Each party agrees to execute, if requested by the Independent Accountant, a reasonable engagement letter.  The Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate with the Independent Accountant and promptly provide all documents and information reasonably requested by the Independent Accountant.  In making such calculation, the Independent Accountant shall consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Statement and the Purchaser's calculation of Closing Working Capital as to which the Seller has disagreed in its notice of disagreement duly delivered pursuant to <U>Section 2.4(c)</U>.  The Independent Accountant shall deliver to the Seller and the Purchaser, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no later than 30 days from the date of engagement of the Independent Accountant), a report setting forth such calculation.  Such report shall be final and binding upon the Purchaser and the Seller, and neither the Purchaser nor the Seller shall seek further recourse to courts or other tribunals, other than to enforce such report.  Judgment may be entered to enforce such report in any court of competent jurisdiction.  The Independent Accountant will determine the allocation of the cost of its review and report based on the inverse of the percentage its determination (before such allocation) bears to the total amount of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the Independent Accountant.  For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Independent Accountant awards $600 in favor of the Seller's position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by the Purchaser and 40% of the costs would be borne by the Seller.</LI></P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Transition</U>.

In the event that the Seller is requested or required pursuant to written or oral question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process to disclose any Confidential Information, the Seller will notify Purchaser promptly of the request or requirement so that Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this section.  If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Seller is, on the advice of counsel, required to disclose any Confidential Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt, the Seller may disclose the Confidential Information to the tribunal; provided, however, that the Seller shall use good faith efforts to obtain, at the expense and reasonable request of Purchaser, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed.</LI></P>
