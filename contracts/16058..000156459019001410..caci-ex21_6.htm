NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties and covenants contained herein, and intending to
be legally bound, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

 

Article 1 
PURCHASE AND SALE

 

1.01Purchase and Sale of the Purchased Securities. On the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, (a) Buyer shall

permitted by applicable Law) waived at the Closing) and (ii) March 1, 2019, or
(b) at such other place, time or date as Buyer and the Company may mutually
agree in writing. The date on which the Closing shall occur is referred to

1.04Closing Payments. At the Closing:

 

(a)Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered, (i) to the Blocker Seller an
aggregate amount in cash equal to the Estimated Purchased Shares Purchase
Price (less the Blocker Seller's Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Deposit
Amount), (ii) to CoVant Series LGS an aggregate amount in cash equal to the
Estimated CoVant Series LGS Purchased Units Purchase Price (less CoVant Series

Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b)Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an aggregate amount equal to the Escrow Deposit
Amount to the Escrow Agent for deposit into a separate escrow account (the
"Escrow Account") established pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement,
substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto (the "Escrow
Agreement"), by and among Buyer, the Seller Representative and the Escrow
Agent. The fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be paid 50% by Buyer
and 50% by the Company (as a Company Expense).

 

(c)Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered, to the intended beneficiaries
thereof (as identified in the Payoff Letter or as otherwise identified in
writing by the Seller Representative to Buyer at least two (2) Business Days
prior to Closing), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated in writing by the Seller Representative at least two (2)
Business Days prior to Closing, (i) amounts due and owing pursuant to the
Credit Facility (as set forth in the Payoff Letter), (ii) the Company Expenses

such employees through the payroll systems of the Company Entities), (iii) any
other liabilities included in the computation of Estimated Closing
Indebtedness which by their terms or pursuant to this Agreement are required
to be paid at the Closing and (iv) the Seller Representative Expense Amount.

 

1.05Purchase Price Adjustment.

 

(a)At least three (3) Business Days, but no more than five (5) Business Days,
prior to the Closing, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Buyer (i) an
estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Company Entities as of the
Adjustment Calculation Time (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"), and (ii)
a statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement") setting forth in

   

reasonable detail the Company's good faith estimates of the Closing Cash-on-
Hand (the "Estimated Closing Cash-on-Hand"), the Closing Indebtedness (the
"Estimated Closing Indebtedness"), the Closing Net Working Capital (the
"Estimated Closing Net Working Capital") and the calculation of the Purchase
Price resulting therefrom (the "Estimated Purchase Price"), in each case,
based on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and including the Estimated
Purchased Shares Purchase Price, the Estimated CoVant Series LGS Purchased
Units Purchase Price, the Estimated Legos Holdings Purchased Units Purchase
and each Seller's Pro Rata Portion. The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, the
Estimated Closing Cash-on-Hand, the Estimated Closing Indebtedness and the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital shall each be calculated in accordance
with the Agreed Accounting Principles and in a manner consistent with the
applicable definitions contained in this Agreement. From and after delivery of
the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Statement until
the Closing, the Company shall (x) provide Buyer and its Representatives with
reasonable access at all reasonable times during normal business hours and
upon reasonable prior notice to the books and records of the Company Entities
and to senior management personnel of the Company Entities, in each case, to
the extent reasonably requested by Buyer or any of its Representatives in
connection with their review of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the
Estimated Closing Statement, and (y) cooperate with Buyer and its
Representatives in connection with their review of the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Statement. Provided that Buyer pays
the Purchase Price in accordance with the amounts set forth in the Estimated
Closing Statement, Buyer's obligation to pay the Purchase Price shall be
deemed satisfied, Buyer shall not be responsible or have any liability to any
Person for the division of such proceeds and Buyer shall own the Purchased
Securities, free and clear of all Liens (other than Liens (i) arising under
the Securities Act and applicable state securities Laws or (ii) created or
incurred by, or at the direction of, Buyer). Any disputes among the Sellers
with respect to the allocation of the Purchase Price among such Sellers shall
not interfere in any way with, or give rise to any claim or right upon,
Buyer's ownership of the Purchased Securities.

 

(b)Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to the Seller Representative (i) an unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of the Company Entities as of the Adjustment Calculation Time (the
"Closing Balance Sheet"), and (ii) a statement (the "Closing Statement")
setting forth in reasonable detail Buyer's calculation of the Closing Cash-on-
Hand, the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Net Working Capital and the
calculation of the Purchase Price resulting therefrom, in each case, based on
the Closing Balance Sheet. The Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Cash-on-
Hand, the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Net Working Capital shall each
be calculated in accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles and in a
manner consistent with the applicable definitions contained in this Agreement.
During the thirty (30) days immediately following the Seller Representative's
receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Company Entities to, (x) provide the Seller Representative
and its Representatives with reasonable access at all reasonable times during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the books and
records of the Company Entities and to senior management personnel of the
Company Entities, in each case, to the extent reasonably requested by the
Seller Representative or any of its Representatives in connection with their
review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, and (y)
cooperate with the Seller Representative and its Representatives in connection
with their review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement.

 

(c)The Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the Closing Cash-on-
Hand, the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Net Working Capital and the
Purchase Price set forth thereon shall become final and binding upon the
parties hereto thirty (30) days following the Seller Representative's receipt
thereof unless the Seller Representative gives written notice of its
disagreement (a "Notice of Disagreement") to Buyer prior to such date, which
notice shall describe

   

in reasonable detail the nature of such disagreement; provided, that (i) the
Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the Closing Cash-on-Hand, the
Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Net Working Capital and the Purchase Price
set forth thereon shall become final and binding upon the parties hereto upon
the Seller Representative's delivery, prior to the expiration of such thirty
(30)-day period, of written notice to Buyer of its acceptance of the Closing
Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the Closing Cash-on-Hand, the Closing
Indebtedness, the Closing Net Working Capital and the Purchase Price set forth
thereon, (ii) except to the extent addressed by a duly delivered Notice of
Disagreement prior to the expiration of such thirty (30)-day period, each
component of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the Closing
Cash-on-Hand, the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Net Working Capital and
the Purchase Price set forth thereon, shall become final and binding upon the
parties hereto upon the Seller Representative's delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, and (iii) a Notice of Disagreement may only include
disagreements based on (A) the failure of the Closing Cash-on-Hand, the
Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Net Working Capital, in each case, as
reflected on the Closing Statement, to be calculated in accordance with the
Agreed Accounting Principles and in a manner consistent with the applicable
definitions contained in this Agreement and/or (B) mathematical errors in the
computation of the Closing Cash-on-Hand, the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing
Net Working Capital or the Purchase Price.

 

(d)If a timely Notice of Disagreement is delivered by the Seller
Representative to Buyer in accordance with Section 1.05(c), then the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (as revised in accordance with this
Section 1.05(d)), and the Closing Cash-on-Hand, the Closing Indebtedness, the
Closing Net Working Capital and the Purchase Price set forth thereon shall
become final and binding upon the parties hereto on the earlier of (x) the
date all matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement are finally resolved
in writing by the Seller Representative and Buyer and (y) the date all matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement not resolved by written agreement of
the Seller Representative and Buyer are finally resolved in writing by a
nationally recognized accounting, consulting or valuation firm (other than a
so-called "Big Four" accounting firm) mutually selected by the Seller
Representative and Buyer (such firm, the "Arbiter"). The Closing Balance Sheet
and the Closing Statement shall be revised to the extent necessary to reflect
any resolution by the Seller Representative and Buyer and/or any final
resolution made by the Arbiter in accordance with this Section 1.05(d). During
the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement in accordance with Section 1.05(c) or such longer period as the
Seller Representative and Buyer may agree in writing, the Seller
Representative and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any
differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement, and all such discussions related thereto shall (unless
otherwise agreed by Buyer and the Seller Representative) be governed by Rule
408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement). At the end of such thirty (30)-day period or such agreed-upon
longer period, the Seller Representative and Buyer shall submit to the Arbiter
for review and resolution any and all matters (but only such matters) which
remain in dispute and which were properly included in the Notice of
Disagreement. Buyer and the Seller Representative shall instruct the Arbiter
to, and the Arbiter shall, make a final determination of the items included in
the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (to the extent such
amounts are properly in dispute) in accordance with the guidelines and
procedures set forth in this Agreement. Buyer and the Seller Representative
will cooperate with the Arbiter during the term of its engagement. Buyer and
the Seller Representative shall instruct the Arbiter not to, and the Arbiter
shall not, assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest
value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Seller
Representative, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such
item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Seller Representative, on the
other hand. Buyer and the Seller Representative shall also instruct the
Arbiter to, and the Arbiter shall, make its determination based solely on
written presentations

   

by Buyer and the Seller Representative that are in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement and not on the basis of
an independent review. The Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and
the Closing Cash-on-Hand, the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Net Working
Capital and the Purchase Price set forth thereon shall become final and
binding on the parties hereto on the date the Arbiter delivers its final
resolution in writing to Buyer and the Seller Representative (which final
resolution shall be requested by the parties to be delivered not more than
thirty (30) days following submission of such disputed matters), and such
resolution by the Arbiter shall not be subject to court review or otherwise
appealable, absent manifest error or manifest failure by the Arbiter to adhere
to the requirements of this Agreement. The Seller Representative (on behalf of
the Sellers) shall pay a portion of the fees and expenses of the Arbiter equal
to the percentage by which the portion of the disputed amounts in the Seller
Representative's submission to the Arbiter not awarded to the Seller
Representative bears to the aggregate amount actually disputed by the Seller
Representative in the Seller Representative's submission to the Arbiter, and
the Company shall pay the remaining portion of such fees and expenses.

 

(e)If the Estimated Purchase Price is less than the Purchase Price (such
shortfall, the "Adjustment Amount"), then (i) Buyer shall, within two (2)
Business Days after the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the
Closing Cash-on-Hand, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Net Working Capital and
the Purchase Price set forth thereon become final and binding on the parties
pursuant to this Section 1.05, make payment of the Adjustment Amount, by wire
transfer in immediately available funds (or other alternative delivery
arrangement mutually agreed by the Seller Representative and Buyer in writing)
to, or as directed by, the Seller Representative, and (ii) Buyer and the
Seller Representative shall, within two (2) Business Days after the Closing
Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the Closing Cash-on-Hand, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Net Working Capital and the Purchase Price set forth
thereon become final and binding on the parties pursuant to this Section 1.05,
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow
Agent to make payment of the Escrow Funds from the Escrow Account, within two
(2) Business Days after receipt of such instructions, to, or as directed by,
the Seller Representative.

 

(f)If the Estimated Purchase Price is greater than the Purchase Price (such
excess, the "Excess Amount"), then Buyer and the Seller Representative shall,
within two (2) Business Days after the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing
Statement and the Closing Cash-on-Hand, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Net
Working Capital and the Purchase Price set forth thereon become final and
binding on the parties pursuant to this Section 1.05, deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to make payment,
within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such instructions, to Buyer, by
wire transfer in immediately available funds of the Excess Amount from the
Escrow Funds in the Escrow Account. If the Excess Amount is less than the
Escrow Funds (such shortfall, the "Remaining Escrow Funds"), then Buyer and
the Seller Representative shall, simultaneously with the delivery of the joint
written instructions referred to in the immediately preceding sentence,
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow
Agent to pay the Remaining Escrow Funds from the Escrow Account to, or as
directed by, the Seller Representative.

 

(g)Buyer agrees that (i) the payment of the Excess Amount (if any) from the
Escrow Funds in the Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow Agreement
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy and source of recovery for Buyer for
payment of the Excess Amount (if any) and (ii) the purchase price adjustment
and the dispute resolution provisions provided for in this Section 1.05, shall
be the exclusive remedies for the matters addressed or that could be addressed
by this Section 1.05. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no claim by Buyer for the payment of the Excess
Amount (or any portion thereof) shall be asserted against any of the Seller
Parties.

   

(h)Any payment made pursuant to this Section 1.05 shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

 

1.06Withholding Rights. Buyer, Blocker, the Company, the Seller
Representative and the Escrow Agent shall each be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Purchase Price or any other payments required to be made
hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement such amounts as Buyer, Blocker, the
Company, the Seller Representative or the Escrow Agent, as applicable, is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any applicable provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax
Law. Except with respect to payments in the nature of compensation to be made
to employees or former employees of the Company Entities, if Buyer or the
Company determines that an amount is required to be deducted and withheld,
Buyer or the Company, as applicable, shall give the Seller Representative at
least five (5) Business Days' prior written notification (or as soon as
reasonably practicable after Buyer or the Company determines such deduction or
withholding is required) of its intention to make any such deduction or
withholding and shall reasonably cooperate with the Seller Representative to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any such deduction or withholding. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted or withheld and duly and timely remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Entities by Buyer, the Company, the Seller
Representative or the Escrow Agent, as applicable, such deducted or withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

set forth in this Agreement (including Article 3), the representations and
warranties of the Company Sellers expressly set forth in this Agreement
(including Article 4) or the representations and warranties of the Blocker

Buyer Party arising out of actual, common law fraud in the making of the
representations and warranties of the Company expressly set forth in this
Agreement (including Article 3), the representations and warranties of Company
Sellers expressly set forth in this Agreement (including Article 4) or the
representations and warranties of the Blocker Seller expressly set forth in

solely for its own account, for investment only and not with a view toward or
for sale in connection with any distribution thereof in violation of the
Securities Act. Buyer understands and agrees that the equity interests of the

state, local and foreign securities Laws and may not be sold, transferred,
offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without
registration under the Securities Act, except pursuant to an exemption from
such registration available under the Securities Act, and without compliance
with state, local and foreign securities Laws, in each case, to the extent
applicable.

 

Article 7 
COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

 

7.01Access. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier
of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, and subject to applicable Law, the Company shall grant to Buyer and its
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, to the personnel, properties, books and records of the
Company Entities and Blocker (including, where applicable, copies thereof);
provided, that (a) such access does not unreasonably interfere with the normal
operations of any Company Entity or Blocker or involve any environmental
sampling or testing or any invasive or subsurface investigation, (b) all
requests for such access shall be directed to Douglas Manya or such other
Person(s) as the Company may designate in writing from time to time
(collectively, the "Designated Contacts"), and (c) nothing herein shall
require the Company to provide access to, or to disclose any information to,
Buyer or any of its Representatives to the extent such access or disclosure
(1) would waive any legal privilege, (2) would be in violation of applicable
Laws (including the HSR Act and all other applicable Antitrust Laws), or (3)
would disclose any source code or Trade Secret; provided, that the Company
shall cooperate with Buyer to attempt to find a way to allow disclosure of
such information to the extent doing so would not (in the reasonable judgment
of the Company after consultation with counsel) reasonably be likely to
violate any Law or result in the loss of such privilege. Other than the
Designated Contacts or as expressly provided in the preceding sentence, Buyer
is not authorized to and shall not (and shall cause its employees, agents,
advisors, counsel, Representatives and Affiliates not to) contact any officer,
director, employee, customer, reseller, distributor, supplier, lessee, lessor
or other material business relation of any Company Entity prior to the Closing
without the prior written consent of the Company. Buyer shall, and shall cause
its Representatives to, abide by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
with respect to such access and any information furnished to it or its
representatives pursuant to this Section 7.01, and Buyer shall be liable to
the Company for any failure of any of its Representatives to abide by the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

7.02Conduct of Business. Except as set forth on Section 7.02 of the Company
Disclosure Letter:

 

(a)During the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or consented to in writing
by Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably

   

withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to), and Blocker Seller shall cause Blocker to, (i) conduct its
business in the ordinary course of business in substantially the same manner
heretofore conducted (including any conduct that is reasonably related,
complementary or incidental thereto), and (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to (A) preserve substantially intact its business organization and
assets; (B) keep available the services of its current officers and key
employees; (C) preserve their current relationships with customers, suppliers
and other persons with which they have significant business relations; and (D)
keep and maintain their assets and properties in good repair and normal
operating condition, wear and tear excepted.

 

(b)During the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
except as explicitly required or contemplated by this Agreement or applicable
Law or consented to in writing by Buyer (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) in advance, the Company shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to and Blocker Seller shall
cause Blocker not to, take (or omit to take) any action that would have been
required to be disclosed on Section 3.07 of the Company Disclosure Letter if
it were to have occurred during the period between the date of the Latest
Balance Sheet and the date hereof.

 

7.03Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances; Consents of Third Parties;
Lien Releases.

 

(a)Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto, shall
cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to: (i) cause the other
parties' conditions to Closing and the conditions set forth in Section 2.01 to
be satisfied and for the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and (ii)
assist with planning for the post-Closing integration of Buyer and the Company
Entities (including by making available the Company Entities' information
technology systems and personnel to assist with the transition and
implementation of IT-related matters on the Closing Date), at the Buyer's sole
cost and expense, subject to limitations under applicable Law; provided, that
the failure to provide such assistance as Buyer deems reasonably necessary as
described in the foregoing clause (ii) shall not serve as a basis for a
failure of the condition set forth in Section 2.02(b), and no party shall take
any action designed to prevent, impede or delay the Closing. Following the
Closing, from time to time, as and when requested by any party, each party
shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such
documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such
further or other actions, as such other party may reasonably deem necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. 

 

(b)During the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
the Sellers and the Company shall (and shall cause the other Company Entities
to), shall cooperate with the Buyer and use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain all consents, approvals or authorizations of third parties under any
Unclassified Contracts as may be required to transfer the benefits of such
Unclassified Contracts to Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries; provided that, in
no event shall "reasonable best efforts" of the Company Entities or the
Sellers for purposes of this Section 7.03(b) include making any payment,
agreeing to any adverse commercial term or incurring any liability (in each
case, other than de minimis consent-related fees) in order to obtain any such
consent, approval or authorization.

 

(c)During the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain evidence that each
of the liens set forth on Schedule 7.03(c) have been terminated and released
prior to the Closing. 

   

7.04Regulatory Act Compliance. The parties shall each file or cause to be
filed, promptly (but in any event in the case of the initial notification
required under the HSR Act on or prior to January 25, 2019, or on or before
such later date as Buyer and the Company may mutually agree in writing) after
the date of this Agreement, any notifications or the like required to be filed
by Buyer or the Company, as applicable, under the HSR Act and all other
applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the purchase and sale of the
Purchased Securities and any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and shall specifically request early termination of the waiting
period thereunder). Each of Buyer and the Company (as a Company Expense) shall
pay 50% of any filing fees with respect to such filings. The parties shall
use their reasonable best efforts to respond to any requests for additional
information made by any Antitrust Authorities and to take all actions
necessary (and not omit or fail to take any action necessary) to cause the
waiting periods or other requirements under the HSR Act and all other
applicable Antitrust Laws to terminate or expire at the earliest possible date
and in no event any later than necessary to ensure that the Closing will occur
no later than the Termination Date (assuming all other conditions to Buyer's
obligation to close have been satisfied or will be satisfied at the Closing),
including resisting in good faith, at each of their respective cost and
expense (including the institution or defense of legal proceedings), any
assertion that the transactions contemplated hereby constitute a violation of
any Antitrust Laws. Buyer agrees to take all actions that are necessary or
advisable or as may be required by any Governmental Entity pursuant to any
Antirust Law to expeditiously (and in no event later than the Termination
Date) consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
(A) selling, licensing or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and
agreeing to sell, license or otherwise dispose of (1) any entities, assets or
facilities of any Company Entity after the Closing or (2) any entity, facility
or asset of Buyer or its Affiliates before or after the Closing, (B)
terminating, amending or assigning existing relationships and contractual
rights and obligations (other than terminations that would result in a breach
of a contractual obligation to a third party), and (C) amending, assigning or
terminating existing licenses or other agreements (other than terminations
that would result in a breach of a license or such other agreement with a
third party) and entering into such new licenses or other agreements. Each of
Buyer and the Company shall furnish to the other party such necessary
information, documents and reasonable assistance as the other party may
request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission which
is necessary under the HSR Act or any Antitrust Laws, and shall consult with
the other prior to any meetings, by telephone or in person, with the staff of
the Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Justice or any
other Governmental Entity, and Buyer and the Company shall have the right to
have a representative present at any such meeting, except, in the case of such
right of the Company, for meetings (or portions thereof) the purpose of which
is to discuss matters exclusively related to Buyer and its Affiliates. During
the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of
the termination of this Agreement or the Closing, except as required by this
Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not engage in any material action or
enter into any material transaction or permit any material action to be taken
or material transaction to be entered into, that would materially impair or
delay Buyer\'s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or perform its obligations hereunder. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, none of Buyer, its Subsidiaries or their
respective Affiliates shall acquire (whether by merger, consolidation, stock
or asset purchase or otherwise), or agree to so acquire, any material amounts
of assets of or any material equity interest in any other Person or any
business or division thereof, unless that acquisition or agreement would not
reasonably be expected to (x) materially increase the risk of not obtaining
any authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any
Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any waiting period under
the HSR Act, or (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Entity
entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to any applicable Antitrust Laws, or
increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or
otherwise.

 

7.05Distribution of Cash and Cash Equivalents. Notwithstanding any other
provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, prior to the Adjustment
Calculation Time, the Sellers shall be entitled to receive from the Company
Entities and Blocker by way of dividends, distributions, return of capital or

   

otherwise all cash and cash equivalents owned or held by or for the benefit of
the Company Entities or Blocker prior to and as of the Adjustment Calculation
Time, and to use such cash and cash equivalents to pay or repay any
liabilities of the Company Entities or Blocker. After the Adjustment
Calculation Time and prior to the Closing, none of the Sellers, Blocker or any
Company Entity shall, without the Buyer's prior written consent, (i) transfer
or pay to any Person, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any
Cash-on-Hand, or (ii) incur or repay any Indebtedness.

 

7.06Press Releases and Announcements. The parties hereto agree that, from the
date hereof through the Closing Date, except as required or expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, no public release or announcement concerning
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued or made by or on behalf
of any party hereto without the prior consent of the other party (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld), except that (x) subject to reasonable prior
consultation with Buyer, each of the Company Entities may make announcements
from time to time to their respective employees, customers and suppliers and
(y) each of the parties hereto may make announcements from time to time as is
necessary to comply with applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer
and the Company shall cooperate to prepare a joint press release to be issued
promptly following the date hereof and on or promptly following the Closing
Date, in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to both
Buyer and the Company. The parties hereto agree to keep the terms of this
Agreement confidential, except to the extent and to the Persons to whom
disclosure is required by applicable Law or for purposes of compliance with
Tax and financial reporting obligations; provided, that (i) the parties hereto
may disclose such terms to their respective employees, accountants, advisors
and other representatives as necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct
of their respective businesses (so long as such Persons agree to, or are bound
by contract to, keep the terms of this Agreement confidential and so long as
the parties shall be responsible to the other parties hereto for breach of
this Section 7.06 or such confidentiality obligations by the recipients of its
disclosure), and (ii) Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, CoVant Technologies and
CoVant Management II, Inc. and each of their respective Affiliates may
disclose on a confidential basis such terms and the existence of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to their respective
Affiliates in order that such Persons may provide customary information on a
confidential basis about the subject matter of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby to their respective limited partners and
prospective limited partners in connection with their fundraising and
reporting activities.

 

7.07Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges that all information provided to it
and to any of its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives by the
Company and its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
(including pursuant to Section 7.01) is subject to the terms of that certain
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of November 16, 2018, by and between Buyer
and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the terms of which are
hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference; provided, that if there
is any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, then the terms of this Agreement shall control and
govern to the extent of such inconsistency.

 

7.08Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance.

 

(a)Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any Company Entity to, amend, repeal
or modify in a manner adverse to the beneficiary thereof any provision in such
Company Entity's Organizational Documents or in any agreement relating to the
exculpation or indemnification of, or the advancement of expenses to, former
officers, managers and directors as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing, it being the intent of the parties that the officers, managers and
directors of the Company Entities prior to the Closing shall continue to be
entitled to such exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (or to such lesser degree as
may be expressly provided in such Company Entity's Organizational Documents as
of the date hereof).

   

(b)Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain at no expense to the
beneficiaries one or more non-cancellable "tail" insurance policies with
claims periods of at least six (6) years following the Closing, and with
substantially equivalent coverage and amounts as, and containing terms no less
favorable, in the aggregate, to the former officers, managers and directors of
the Company Entities than, the Company's director and officer liability
insurance as of the date of this Agreement, including coverage for acts and
omissions of the individuals who were officers, managers and/or directors of
the Company or any Subsidiary (in such capacities) prior to the Closing with
respect to matters arising at or prior to the Closing. The first $110,000 in
costs with respect to such "tail" insurance policies pursuant to this Section
7.08(b) shall be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by the Company (as a Company
Expense) and any remaining costs shall be borne by the Company (as a Company
Expense). All costs borne by the Company pursuant to this Section 7.08(b)
shall be referred to collectively as the "Seller Tail Costs".

 

(c)In the event that Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or
assets to any Person, then, and in each case, the successors and assigns of
Buyer or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall expressly assume and be
bound by the obligations set forth in this Section 7.08.

 

(d)The obligations of Buyer and its Subsidiaries under this Section 7.08 shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Person to whom this Section 7.08 applies without the consent of such affected
Person.

 

7.09Certain Tax Matters.

 

(a)Seller Tax Returns. The Company Entities shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed all Flow-Through Income Tax Returns for
the Company Entities (including IRS Form 1065 and any state or local
equivalent form) for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date
the due date of which is after the Closing Date (the "Seller Tax Returns").
Each such Seller Tax Return, except as otherwise required by applicable Law,
shall be prepared in a manner that is consistent with past custom and practice
of the relevant Company Entity using the historic tax return preparers of the
Company Entities; provided that (x) Transaction Tax Deductions properly
allocable to the Pre-Closing Taxable Period shall be deducted on such Seller
Tax Returns and (y) such Seller Tax Returns shall include the Revenue
Adjustment. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the Company
Entities shall make the election pursuant to Revenue Procedure 2011-29,
2011-18 IRB 746 such that 70% of any success-based fees will be deductible for
U.S. federal or state income tax purposes and shall be included in the
calculation of Transaction Tax Deductions. The Company Entities shall provide
the Seller Representative with the right to review, comment on and consent to
the filing of such Tax Returns no later than twenty (20) days prior to the due
date for filing such Tax Returns. The Company Entities shall make all such
changes as are reasonably requested by the Seller Representative with respect
to such Tax Returns. 

 

(b)Buyer Tax Returns. Buyer shall timely prepare and file, or shall cause to
be prepared and timely filed, all other Tax Returns of the Company Entities
and Blocker with respect to any tax period ending on or before the Closing
Date or Straddle Period, in each case, the due date of which is after the
Closing Date (the "Buyer Tax Returns"). Buyer shall prepare such Tax Returns,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law, in a manner consistent with the
past practices of the Company Entities and Blocker, provided that any
Transaction Tax Deductions deducted on any such Tax Return shall be allocated
to the tax period ending on the Closing Date or the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date, as applicable, to the maximum extent
permitted

   

by applicable Law. Buyer shall provide the Seller Representative with the
right to review and comment on any such Buyer Tax Returns no later than twenty
(20) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return, and, with respect
to any Flow-Through Income Tax Return or Tax Return that may impact the Taxes
or liabilities of the Sellers or their indirect owners, Buyer shall consider
in good faith any changes as are reasonably requested by the Seller
Representative with respect to such Tax Returns. Notwithstanding the
preceding, (i) if a Buyer Tax Return is due within sixty (60) days of the
Closing, then Buyer shall provide such Tax Return for the Seller
Representative's review and comment as soon as practicable (which may be less
than twenty (20) days prior to the date of such Tax Return and (ii) in all
events Buyer shall be permitted to file Tax Returns in a timely manner,
provided that Buyer shall consider in good faith whether to amend any such Tax
Return to the extent necessary to reflect any changes reasonably requested by
the Seller Representative. 

 

(c)Post-Closing Actions. Without the prior written consent of the Seller
Representative, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not, and shall cause the
Company Entities and Blocker not to, (i) other than with respect to the filing
of Tax Returns pursuant to Section 7.09(a) or (b), file, amend or re-file any
Tax Return with respect to a Company Entity or Blocker for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (ii) agree to waive or extend the statute of limitations relating to
any Taxes of any Company Entity or Blocker for any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(iii) make, revoke or change any election with respect to, or that has
retroactive effect to, any Pre-Closing Tax Period of a Company Entity or
Blocker, (iv) make any Code Section 338 or Code Section 336 (or any similar
provision under state, local, or non-U.S. Law) with respect to the acquisition
of the Company Entities or Blocker, or (v) voluntarily approach any Tax
authority regarding any Tax or Tax Return of a Company Entity or Blocker for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case, only to the extent that the Sellers or
their direct or indirect owners would incur any additional Tax liability for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any unreimbursed costs in connection therewith.

 

(d)Tax Treatment.

 

(i)On the Closing Date, following the Closing, Buyer shall contribute the
Company Units to the Blocker (the "Post-Closing Contribution"). Buyer shall,
to the extent permitted or required under applicable Law, (A) treat the date
of the Post-Closing Contribution as the last day of the taxable period of the
Company Entities for all Tax purposes (B) cause Blocker and Axios, Inc. to
join Buyer's "consolidated group" (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(h)) effective on the day after the Closing Date and (C) cause the
Company's status as a partnership for U.S. federal (and applicable state and
local) income Tax purposes to terminate on the Closing Date pursuant to
Section 708(b) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. 

 

(ii)The parties agree that (A) Buyer shall be deemed to contribute the amounts
paid pursuant to Section 1.04(c)(i) to Blocker, and following the Post-Closing
Contribution, Blocker shall be deemed to contribute the amount described in
clause (A) to the Company, then the Company shall be deemed to have repaid the
Credit Facility in accordance with the terms of the Payoff Letter and (B) any
deductions attributable to the repayment of the Credit Facility ("Payoff
Deductions") shall be for the account of Buyer (but subject to Section
7.09(f)) and allocable to the taxable period (or portions thereof) beginning
after the Closing.

 

(e)Carrybacks. The Company Entities and Blocker shall not waive any carryback
of any net operating loss, capital loss or credit on any Tax Return with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall cause the Company Entities
and Blocker to elect to carry back any item of loss,

   

deduction, or credit from any Transaction Tax Deductions and any pre-Closing
losses generally to Pre-Closing Tax Periods to the fullest extent permitted by
Law (using any available short-form or accelerated procedures).

 

(f)Tax Benefits. If any Severance and Retention Deductions, but only to the
extent such amounts are not actually included as a tax asset in the
calculation of Net Working Capital, or any Payoff Deductions, in each case,
directly or indirectly result in a Tax Reduction in any taxable period ending
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, without duplication for any amounts
previously paid hereunder, pay to the Sellers an amount equal to such Tax
Reduction. For purposes of this Section 7.09(f), the amount of any Tax
Reduction shall be determined after taking into account all other applicable
items of income, gain, deduction or loss (or any other Tax attributes) of
Buyer, Blocker, the Company Entities and their Affiliates. Payment of any Tax
Reduction shall be made by Buyer to the Sellers, (x) in the case of a
reduction in Tax liability, when the applicable Tax Return is filed (taking
into account extensions), (y) in the case of a Tax refund, within ten (10)
days after actual receipt of such refund, and (z) in the case of a credit,
within ten (10) days after such credit is used to actually reduce a Tax
liability. In connection with the determination of any Tax Reduction, until
all Severance and Retention Deductions and Payoff Deductions have been fully
utilized, Buyer shall annually provide the Seller Representative with
supporting documentation and other information with respect to the
determination of such Tax Reduction and the amount of any Severance and
Retention Deductions and Payoff Deductions which have not yet resulted in a
Tax Reduction; provided that in no event shall Buyer be required to provide
Seller Representative copies of any Tax Return of Buyer or its Affiliates or
any confidential information.

 

(g)Reserved.

 

(h)Reserved.

 

(i)Straddle Period. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does
not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), Taxes shall be allocated
between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period as follows:
(i) Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts, payments, or payroll of
Blocker or the Company Entities, as applicable, shall be determined based on
an interim closing of the books as of the close of the Closing Date and (ii)
all other Taxes shall be prorated based on number of days in each taxable
period ending on, or beginning after, the Closing Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, in connection with the preparation of a Flow-Through Income Tax Return
for a Straddle Period pursuant to Section 7.09(b), the items on such Tax
Return shall be allocated as between the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on and including the Closing Date and the portion beginning after the Closing
Date based on the interim closing of the books method and the calendar day
convention provided in Code Section 706 and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder (or any corresponding provision of state or local Law).

 

(j)Cooperation. Buyer, Blocker, the Company Entities and the Seller
Representative shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate as and to the extent
reasonably requested in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to
this Section 7.09 and any audit or other Action with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's request)
the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to the
preparation of such Tax Return or the conduct of any such audit or other
Action and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder; provided, however, that Buyer shall be entitled to withhold or
redact any portion of such records and information that do not pertain
exclusively to a Company Entity or Blocker, including any consolidated tax
returns of Buyer or its Affiliates.

   

(k)Tax Contests.

 

(i)Buyer shall promptly forward or cause to be promptly forwarded to the
Seller Representative all written notifications and other communications from
any Tax authority relating to the Blocker or any Company Entity with respect
to a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date to the extent that
such matter would reasonable be expected to affect the Tax liability of the
Sellers (or any of their direct or indirect owners) (a "Seller Tax Matter").

 

(ii)The Seller Representative shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
control any audit or examination by any Tax authority or any other judicial or
administrative proceeding (a "Tax Contest") with respect to any Seller Tax
Matter (a "Seller Tax Contest"); provided, however, that the Seller
Representative shall provide to Buyer (at Buyer's sole cost and expense)
reasonable participation rights with respect to so much of any such Seller Tax
Contest that would reasonably be expected to materially affect the Tax
liability of Buyer, Blocker or any of the Company Entities for any Straddle or
Post-Closing Tax Period, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include any
imputed underpayment payable by any Company Entity pursuant to Code Section
6221-6241. The Seller Representative shall not enter into any settlement of,
or otherwise compromise, any such Seller Tax Contest that could adversely
affect the liability of Buyer, Blocker or any of the Company Entities for any
Taxes as to which the Sellers would not be liable hereunder without the prior
written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed.

 

(iii)If, after receiving written notice of a Seller Tax Contest, the Seller
Representative does not exercise its control rights pursuant to Section
7.09(k)(ii) with respect to such Seller Tax Contest, Buyer shall control the
conduct of such Tax Contest.

 

(iv)Buyer shall have the right to control any Tax Contest other than a Seller
Tax Contest; provided, however, that Buyer shall provide the Seller
Representative (at the Seller Representative's sole cost and expense)
reasonable participation rights with respect to so much of any Tax Contest
that would reasonably be expected to affect the Tax liability of the Sellers.

 

(l)Purchase Price Allocation. The portion of the Purchase Price allocable to
the Company Sellers, as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.05 (plus the
corresponding portion the liabilities of the Company and other items required
to be taken into account for income tax purposes) shall be allocated among the
ratable portion of the assets of the Company in accordance with the principles
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and the methodologies set
forth in Schedule 7.09(l) (the "Allocation"). The Buyer shall deliver to the
Seller Representative a draft allocation within sixty (60) days after the
final determination of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.05 (the "Draft
Allocation"). The Seller Representative shall review the Draft Allocation and
provide the Buyer with comments within thirty (30) days of the date that the
Seller Representative received the Draft Allocation and the Buyer shall
prepare a final allocation schedule and shall consider the Seller
Representative's comments in good faith (the "Final Allocation"). Any disputes
with respect to the Draft Allocation or Final Allocation shall be resolved
pursuant to the procedures described in Section 1.05 mutatis mutandis and the
resolution of such disputes shall be incorporated by Buyer into the Final
Allocation. The parties (i) shall file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns in
a manner consistent with the Final Allocation and (ii) shall not take any
action or position for Tax purposes that is inconsistent with the Final
Allocation, except, in each case, to the extent required by a final
determination pursuant to Code Section 1313(a). If the Purchase Price is
adjusted

   

pursuant to this Agreement, the Final Allocation shall be adjusted as
appropriate and Buyer and the Seller Representative shall cooperate in good
faith in making any such adjustments.

Code Section 754 (and any equivalent election under state, local or non-U.S.
Tax Law) with respect to the taxable year that ends on the Closing Date to the
extent that such an election is not already in place. 

 

7.10Exclusivity. Each Seller and the Company agrees that from the date hereof
and until the earlier of the Closing Date and the date that this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, such Seller and the Company shall

Entities and the Blocker, respectively, not to, and the Sellers and the
Company shall instruct their respective Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (a) provide any non-public information to any third party
(including via access to any data room or other records) other than Buyer and
its Representatives with respect to any Company Transaction, (b) solicit,
initiate, facilitate or encourage proposals, offers or inquiries from a third

Transaction. The Company shall notify Buyer immediately, but in any event with
24 hours, if any Person makes any proposal, offer, inquiry or contact with
respect to a Company Transaction, which notification shall include the
identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or contact and the
proposed terms thereof. Upon execution and delivery of this Agreement by all
parties hereto, each Seller and the Company immediately shall cease and cause
to be terminated all existing discussions, conversations, negotiations and
other communications with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to a
Company Transaction.

registration and other such taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other similar fees and charges incurred in connection with the
consummation of the purchase and sale of the Purchased Securities and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer
Taxes") shall be paid by the Company (as a Company Expense).

 

7.12Certain Post-Closing Access Provisions.

 

(a)For a period of seven (7) years, or, if shorter, the applicable period
specified in Buyer's document retention policy, after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve and retain, or to cause
the Company Entities and Blocker to preserve and retain and maintain, in an
accessible form, all material corporate, accounting, legal and Tax books and
records of the Company Entities and Blocker relating to the conduct of the
business and operations of the Company Entities and Blocker prior to the
Closing Date and after such period and prior to the destruction of such books
and records, Buyer shall upon written request of the Seller Representative
offer to the Seller Representative possession or transfer of such books and
records (which offer must be accepted within thirty (30) days after receipt
thereof or it will be deemed to have been rejected); provided, however, that
the Seller Representative and its Representatives will agree in advance to a
customary confidentiality agreement with respect to such information.

   

(b)After the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company Entities and Blocker
to permit the Seller Representative (and its counsel, advisors, agents or
other representatives reasonably requiring such access in light of the purpose
therefor) to have reasonable access, during normal business hours and on
reasonable advance notice, to inspect and copy (including in electronic form),
all materials referred to in this Section 7.12 and to meet with officers and
employees of Buyer and the Company Entities and Blocker on a mutually
convenient basis in order to obtain explanations with respect to such
materials, and to obtain additional information and to call such officers and
employees as witnesses, in each case, at the sole expense of the Seller
Representative; provided, however, that the Buyer shall be entitled to
withhold or redact any portion of such Tax records or information that do not
pertain exclusively to a Company Entity or Blocker, including any consolidated
tax returns of Buyer or its Affiliates and the Seller Representative and its
Representatives will agree in advance to a customary confidentiality agreement
with respect to such information.

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
the event that providing access to the foregoing materials would violate
applicable Law or of any litigation or threatened litigation between the
Seller Parties, on the one hand, and the Buyer Parties, on the other hand,
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, the
covenants contained in this Section 7.12 shall not apply thereto (including
for discovery purposes) and shall not be considered a waiver by any party of
any right to assert the attorney client privilege or any similar privilege.

 

7.13280G Cooperation. The Company Seller will use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Company Entities to submit to any applicable equityholder vote
before the Closing Date the right of any "disqualified individual" (as defined
in Code Section 280G(c)) to receive any and all payments and other benefits
contingent on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i)) so that in the
event of the applicable approval, no payment received or which could be
received by such "disqualified individual" would be a "parachute payment"
under Code Section 280G(b). Before any such submission to equityholders, the
Company Seller will cause the Company Entities to provide disclosure to the
applicable equityholders in a manner that complies with the stockholder
approval requirements under Code Section 280G(b)(5)(B) and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, including QandA 7 of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.280G-1. Within no later than three (3) Business Days prior to such
vote, Buyer and its counsel shall have the right to review and comment on all
documents to be delivered to the equityholders in connection with such vote
(including the underlying calculations) and any required disqualified
individual waivers or consents. The parties acknowledge that this Section 7.13
shall not apply to any Buyer Arrangements. In the event that Buyer provides to
the Company Seller, no less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, a written description of any Buyer Arrangements, the Company Seller
shall cause the Company Entities to include such description in any materials
disclosed to equityholders in connection with soliciting shareholder approval
in accordance with this Section 7.13; provided, however, that compliance with
the remainder of this Section 7.13 shall be determined as if such Buyer
Arrangements had not been entered into. The parties hereto acknowledge that
the Company Seller cannot compel any disqualified individual to waive any
existing rights under a contract with any Company Entity and the Company
Seller shall not be deemed in breach of this Section 7.13 with respect to any
disqualified individual who refuses to waive any such right after the Company
Seller has used its reasonable best efforts to obtain such waiver from such
disqualified individual; provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, such
reasonable best efforts shall not require the Company Seller or any Company
Entity to pay any additional amounts to such individual.

 

7.14Seller Release. The Sellers, at or prior to the Closing, shall execute
and deliver to the Company, for the benefit of the Blocker and the Company
Entities, a general release and discharge, in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit G attached hereto (each, a "Seller Release").

to the Closing, and all documentation evidencing the Restructuring shall be in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Buyer.

 

7.16Certain Employee Covenants.

 

(a)In the event that any Covered Employee ceases to be employed by a Company
Entity or Buyer or any of its Affiliates at any time during the twelve (12)
month period following the Closing Date, Buyer will cause such Covered
Employee to receive the same benefits and payments as would have been received
by such Covered Employee if the LGS Plan were to have remained in effect for
the benefit of such Covered Employee at the time of such cessation of
employment. Any benefits or payments made to any Covered Employee by the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (including the Company Entities) shall take into
account service by each Covered Employee with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing to the same extent such service was
recognized by the Company Entities on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this Section 7.16,
express or implied, shall confer upon any Person other than the parties to
this Agreement and their respective permitted successors and assigns any legal
or equitable rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever (including any third-
party beneficiary rights) with respect to the provisions of this Section 7.16.

 

(b)At any time and from time to time during the eighteen (18) month period
following the Closing Date, in the event that any payment becomes due and
owing by Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company Entities) pursuant to
any Severance Agreement, Buyer shall have the right to give written notice to
the Sellers' Representative setting forth (i) the Termination Date of the
applicable Severance Recipient, (ii) a calculation of the aggregate payment
due and owing to such Severance Recipient and (iii) a reasonably detailed
calculation of the Seller Severance Agreement Payment Amount with respect to
such Severance Recipient. Within five (5) Business Days following the date of
any such written notice, the Sellers' Representative shall (on behalf of each
Seller in accordance with such Seller's Pro Rata Portion) pay by wire transfer
of immediately available funds such Seller Severance Agreement Payment Amount
to or as designated in writing by the Buyer.

 

(c)Promptly following the end of each calendar quarter during the 12-month
period following the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver a written notice to the
Sellers' Representative setting forth, in reasonable detail, (i) the names of
any Covered Employees who have ceased to be employed by a Company Entity or
Buyer or any of its Affiliates at any time during such 12-month period, (ii)
the aggregate amount due and owing by the Buyer and its Affiliates (including
the Company Entities) to all such Covered Employees under the LGS Plan, and
(iii) a calculation of the Seller Post-Closing Payment Amount. Within five
(5) Business Days following the date of any such written notice, the Sellers'
Representative shall (on behalf of each Seller in accordance with such
Seller's Pro Rata Portion) pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds
such Seller Post-Closing Payment Amount to or as designated in writing by the
Buyer.

 

(d)Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause each Retention Agreement to be amended to provide that all Retention
Agreement Payments due thereunder are payable at the Closing.

Article 10 
MISCELLANEOUS

Covenants; Certain Waivers.

 

(a)Each of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Sellers
set forth in this Agreement (including any certificate to be delivered under
Article 2), or in any Ancillary Agreement, shall terminate effective
immediately as of the Closing such that no claim for breach of any such
representation or warranty, detrimental reliance or other right or remedy
(whether in contract, in tort or at law or in equity) may be brought after the
Closing with respect thereto against the Sellers or any other Seller Party;
provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Seller
Fundamental Representations shall, in each case, expressly survive the Closing
until sixty (60) days following the expiration of any applicable statute of
limitations. The covenants and agreements of the Company, Blocker and the
Sellers set forth in this Agreement and in any Ancillary Agreement to the
extent contemplating or requiring performance by the Company, Blocker or the
Sellers prior to the Closing shall terminate effective immediately as of the
Closing such that no claim for breach of any such covenant, detrimental
reliance or other right or remedy (whether in contract, in tort, at law or in
equity) may be brought after the Closing with respect thereto against the
Sellers or any other Seller Party. Each covenant or agreement of the Sellers
requiring performance at or after the Closing, shall, in each case, expressly
survive the Closing, and nothing in this Section 10.01(a) or Section 10.01(b)
shall be deemed to limit any rights or remedies of Buyer for breach of any
such surviving covenant or agreement.

 

(b)Buyer, for itself and on behalf of the other Buyer Parties (including,
after the Closing, the Company Entities and Blocker), acknowledges and agrees
that, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may have
against any Seller Party relating to the operation of the Company Entities and
Blocker or their respective businesses or relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Letter, and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, whether arising under, or based upon, any
federal, state, local or foreign statute, Law or otherwise (including any
right, whether arising at law or in equity, to seek indemnification,
contribution, cost recovery, damages or any other recourse or remedy,
including as may arise under common law) are hereby irrevocably waived.
Furthermore, without limiting the generality of this Section 10.10(b), no
claim

   

shall be brought or maintained by, or on behalf of, Buyer or any other Buyer
Party (including, after the Closing, the Company Entities and Blocker) against
any Seller Party, and no recourse shall be sought or granted against any of
them, by virtue of, or based upon, any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy
in, or breach of, any of the representations, warranties or covenants of the
Company, Blocker or the Sellers or any other Person set forth or contained in
this Agreement, any certificate, instrument, agreement or other document of
the Company, Blocker or the Sellers or any other Person delivered hereunder,
the subject matter of this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Letter and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the business, the ownership,
operation, management, use or control of the business of any of the Company
Entities or Blocker, any of their assets, or any actions or omissions at, or
prior to, the Closing.

 

(c)Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this Section
10.01 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements set forth in this Section 10.01, the
Company, Blocker and the Sellers would not enter into this Agreement or
otherwise agree to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company, Blocker and
each Seller acknowledge that nothing in this Section 10.01 or otherwise shall
limit the right of Buyer to bring any claim or cause of action and obtain any
remedy otherwise available to it against any Person arising out of any (i)
breach of the Company and Seller Fundamental Representations or (ii) actual,
common law fraud in the making of the representations and warranties of the
Company expressly set forth in this Agreement (including in Article 3), the
representations and warranties of the Company Sellers expressly set forth in
this Agreement (including Article 4), or the representations and warranties of
the Blocker Seller expressly set forth in this Agreement (including Article
5).

 

(e)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contract, but subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 10.01(a) and without duplication, following
the Closing, each Seller will indemnify and defend the Buyer Indemnified
Parties against, and will hold each Buyer Indemnified Party harmless, from
such Seller's Pro Rata Portion of any actual loss suffered or incurred or
imposed on such Buyer Indemnified Party to the extent arising out of any
breach of a Company and Seller Fundamental Representation. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Buyer Indemnified Parties, subject to the limitations set forth
herein, may recover any such losses directly from the Sellers, as applicable.
The indemnity recoverable pursuant to this Section shall not in any event
exceed an amount equal to the Purchase Price, nor shall the indemnity
recoverable from any individual Seller exceed such Seller's Pro Rata Portion
of the Purchase Price. 

 

10.02Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be amended or any provision of
this Agreement may be waived; provided, that (a) any amendment shall be
binding only if such amendment is set forth in a writing executed by the
Seller Representative, Blocker, the Company and Buyer and (b) any waiver of
any provision of this Agreement shall be effective against any Seller,
Blocker, the Company and Buyer only if set forth in a writing executed by such
Person. No course of dealing between or among any Persons having any interest
in this Agreement shall be deemed effective to modify, amend or discharge any
part of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any person under or by
reason of this Agreement.

instruction, demand, document or other communication hereunder using any other
means (including personal delivery, expedited courier, messenger service,

demand, document or other communication shall be deemed to have been duly
given unless and until it actually is received by the party for whom it is
intended.

 

10.04Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in
whole or in part, (including by operation of law) without the prior written
consent of the Seller Representative and Buyer; provided, that this Agreement,
and all rights, interests and obligations hereunder, may be assigned, in whole
or in part, without consent, by Buyer to any of its Affiliates, for collateral
security purposes to any Persons providing financing to Buyer, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms thereof (including for purposes
of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in
respect of such financing). No assignment shall relieve the assigning party of
any of its obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment of rights or
delegation of performance obligations in violation of this Section 10.04 is
void.

 

10.05Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provisions or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



   

10.06No Strict Construction. Notwithstanding the fact that this Agreement has
been drafted or prepared by one of the parties, Buyer and the Sellers confirm
that they and their respective counsel have reviewed, negotiated and adopted
this Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding of the parties hereto
and the language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language
chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of
strict construction shall be applied against any Person. In the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises with respect to this
Agreement, the terms and provisions of the execution version of this Agreement
shall control and prior drafts of this Agreement shall not be considered or
analyzed for any purpose (including in support of parol evidence proffered by
any Person in connection with this Agreement).

 

10.07Captions. The captions used in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this
Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced and
construed as if no such caption had been used in this Agreement.

 

10.08Complete Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, whether
executed and delivered on or after the date hereof, contain the complete
agreement among the parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or between such parties, whether written or
oral, or any prior course of dealing among them, which may have related to the
subject matter hereof in any way.

 

10.09Company Disclosure Letter. The disclosure of any item in any Section or
subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with
respect to any other Section or subsection to the extent that the relevance of
such disclosure to such other section or subsection is reasonably apparent
from the face of such disclosure, notwithstanding the fact that the Company
Disclosure Letter is arranged by sections corresponding to the sections in
this Agreement or that a particular Section of this Agreement makes reference
to a specific Section of the Company Disclosure Letter and notwithstanding
that a particular representation and warranty may not make a reference to the
Company Disclosure Letter. The inclusion of information in the Company
Disclosure Letter shall not be construed as, and shall not constitute, an
admission or agreement that a violation, right of termination, default,
liability or other obligation of any kind exists with respect to any item, nor
shall it be construed as or constitute an admission or agreement that such
information is material to any of the Company Entities. In addition, matters
reflected in the Company Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited to
matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Company Disclosure
Letter. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only
and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. Neither the
specifications of any dollar amount in any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
the Company Disclosure Letter is intended to imply that such amount, or higher
or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not
material, and no Person shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such
amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between
the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in the Company Disclosure Letter is or is not material for
purposes of this Agreement. Further, neither the specification of any item or
matter in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement
nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Letter is
intended to imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or
are not in the ordinary course of business, and no Person shall use the fact
of setting forth or the inclusion of any such items or matter in any dispute
or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described herein or included in the Company Disclosure Letter is or
is not in the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement.

.pdf or .tif formats) signature pages), all of which, taken together, shall
constitute one and the same Agreement.

 

10.12Governing Law. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action
(whether at law or in equity, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof, or the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law
provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that
that would cause the application of the Laws of any other jurisdiction other
than the State of Delaware.

 

10.13CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 1.05
(WHICH SHALL GOVERN ANY DISPUTE ARISING THEREUNDER), THE PARTIES AGREE THAT
JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN ANY SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY
PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY SHALL
PROPERLY AND EXCLUSIVELY LIE IN THE CHANCERY COURT OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE,
AND ANY STATE APPELLATE COURT THEREFROM WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE (OR, IF
THE CHANCERY COURT OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE DECLINES TO ACCEPT JURISDICTION
OVER A PARTICULAR MATTER, ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT WITHIN THE STATE OF
DELAWARE). EACH PARTY ALSO AGREES NOT TO BRING ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING,
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY IN ANY OTHER COURT (OTHER THAN UPON THE APPEAL OF ANY JUDGMENT,
DECISION OR ACTION OF ANY SUCH COURT LOCATED IN DELAWARE OR, AS APPLICABLE,
ANY FEDERAL APPELLATE COURT THAT INCLUDES THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHIN ITS
JURISDICTION). BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY
IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS FOR ITSELF AND IN
RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. THE
PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT VENUE WOULD BE PROPER IN SUCH COURT, AND HEREBY
WAIVE ANY OBJECTION THAT ANY SUCH COURT IS AN IMPROPER OR INCONVENIENT FORUM
FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. EACH OF THE PARTIES
FURTHER IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENTS TO SERVICE OF PROCESS IN THE
MANNER PROVIDED FOR NOTICES IN SECTION 10.03. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by law.

 

10.14WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO

   

TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL
TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF
THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR
HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. THE
PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A
JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT
WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE
IRREVOCABLE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

10.15Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto or their
respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights, benefits, remedies or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement; provided, that Seller
Parties and, solely with respect to Section 7.08, Persons who were officers
and/or directors of the Company prior to Closing, shall be deemed to be third-
party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to enforce, Section 1.04,
Section 1.05 and Section 7.08. The parties hereto further agree that the
rights of third party beneficiaries to enforce this Agreement as provided
above shall not arise unless and until the Closing occurs.

 

10.16Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage,
for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed
in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if
the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them hereunder to
consummate the purchase and sale of the Purchased Securities or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed
that (a) the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the
courts described in Section 10.13 without proof of damages or otherwise, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement, and (b) the right of specific performance and other equitable
relief is an integral part of the purchase and sale of the Purchased
Securities and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
without that right, neither the Sellers or the Company nor Buyer would have
entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific performance or other equitable relief is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that
a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the
parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 10.16 shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

 

10.17Provisions Respecting Representation of the Company. Each of the parties
to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, managers, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates,
that Kirkland and Ellis LLP may serve as counsel to the Company Entities and
Blocker, on the one hand, and certain of the Seller Parties (such Seller
Parties, individually and collectively, the "Seller Group"), on the other
hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (the "Existing Representation"), and that, following
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Kirkland and Ellis LLP (or
any of its respective successors) may serve as counsel to Seller Group or any
director, manager, member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of any
member of

   

Seller Group, in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the purchase and sale of the Purchased
Securities or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
notwithstanding the Existing Representation of the Company and/or any of its
Subsidiaries and/or Blocker, and each of the parties hereto (on its own behalf
and on behalf of its Affiliates) hereby consents thereto and irrevocably
waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such parties
shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to irrevocably waive any conflict
of interest arising from such representation. The parties agree to take the
steps necessary to ensure that any privilege attaching as a result of Kirkland
and Ellis LLP representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and Blocker in
connection with the purchase and sale of the Purchased Securities and any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall survive the
Closing and shall remain in effect, provided that such privilege from and
after the Closing shall be controlled by the Seller Representative on behalf
of the Seller Parties. As to any privileged attorney‑client communications
between Kirkland and Ellis LLP and the Company or Kirkland and Ellis LLP and any
of the Company's Subsidiaries or Blocker in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the
"Privileged Communications"), Buyer, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
and Blocker, together with any of their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries,
successors or assigns, agree that no such party may use or rely on any of the
Privileged Communications in any action against or involving any of the
parties after the Closing. In addition, if the purchase and sale of the
Purchased Securities and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are consummated, all Privileged Communications related to such transactions
will become property of (and be controlled by) the Seller Representative, and
none of Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Blocker or any of their
respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns shall retain any
copies of such records or have any access to them. In the event that Buyer is
legally required or requested by any Governmental Entity to access or obtain a
copy of all or a portion of the Privileged Communications, Buyer shall be
entitled to access or obtain a copy of and disclose the Privileged
Communications to the extent necessary to comply with any such legal
requirement or request; provided that, if practicable, Buyer shall promptly
notify the Seller Representative in writing (prior to the disclosure by Buyer
of any Privileged Communications to the extent practicable) so that the Seller
Representative can seek a protective order and Buyer agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts (at the sole cost and expense of the Seller
Representative) to assist therewith.

 

10.18Designation and Replacement of Seller Representative. The parties hereto
have agreed that it is desirable to designate a representative to act on
behalf of the Sellers for certain limited purposes, as specified herein (a
"Seller Representative"). The parties have designated Legos Holdings as the
initial Seller Representative hereunder, and execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Sellers shall, to the maximum extent permitted under
applicable law, constitute (a) irrevocable ratification and approval of such
designation by the Sellers and authorization of the Seller Representative to
serve in such capacity (including to settle any and all disputes with Buyer
under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement), and (b) a reaffirmation,
approval, acceptance and adoption of, and an agreement to comply with and
perform, all of the acknowledgements and agreements made by the Seller
Representative on behalf of the Sellers in this Agreement and the other
documents delivered in connection herewith (including the Escrow Agreement).
The Seller Representative may resign at any time and may be removed only by
the vote of Persons that collectively owned more than 50% of the Equity
Securities of Legos Holdings as of immediately prior to the Closing (the
"Majority Holders"). The designation of the Seller Representative is coupled
with an interest, and, except as set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence, such designation is irrevocable and shall not be affected by the
death, incapacity, illness, bankruptcy, dissolution or other inability to act
of any of the Sellers. In the event that a Seller Representative has resigned
or been removed, a new Seller Representative shall be appointed by the
Majority Holders, such appointment to become effective upon the written
acceptance thereof by the new Seller Representative. Written notice of any
such resignation, removal or appointment of a Seller Representative shall be
delivered by the Seller Representative to Buyer promptly after such action is
taken, provided, that until such notice is received, the Buyer shall be
entitled to rely on the decisions, actions, consents and instructions of the
prior Seller Representative, unless at such

   

time such Seller Representative has resigned or has died or has become
incapacitated, in which case the Buyer shall be entitled to rely on the
decisions, actions, consents and instructions of CoVant Series LGS who, in
such case, for all purposes hereunder shall be deemed the Seller
Representative until the appointment of a replacement for the prior Seller
Representative.

 

10.19Authority and Rights of Seller Representative; Limitations on Liability.
The Seller Representative shall have such powers and authority as are
necessary or appropriate to carry out the functions assigned to it under this
Agreement and in any other document delivered in connection herewith
(including the Escrow Agreement). The Seller Representative will be the
exclusive agent for and on behalf of the Seller Parties to (1) enter into the
Escrow Agreement; (2) give and receive notices and communications to or from
Buyer (on behalf of itself or any other Seller Party) and/or the Escrow Agent
relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any of the other documents
contemplated by this Agreement; (3) authorize deliveries to Buyer of cash or
other property from the Escrow Fund and legally bind each Seller Party
thereto; (4) object to such any claims in accordance with this Agreement; (5)
consent or agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
demand arbitration and comply with judgment, decree or order with respect to,
such claims; (6) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of
the Seller Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each
case without having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under any
circumstance; (7) execute for and on behalf of each of the Seller Parties any
amendment to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any exhibit, annex or
schedule hereto or thereto (including for the purpose of amending addresses),
(8) enter into any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 10.01, (9) cause to
be paid to the Seller Parties any amounts retained or set aside by the Seller
Representative for Representative Expenses that are not used in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; and (10) execute
such further instruments of assignment as Buyer shall reasonably request to
which the Seller Representative agrees. The Seller Representative will be the
sole and exclusive means of asserting or addressing any of the above against,
for or on behalf of the Seller Parties, and no Seller Party will have any
right to act on his, her or its own behalf with respect to any such matter,
other than any claim or dispute against the Seller Representative. All
decisions and actions by the Seller Representative (to the extent authorized
by this Agreement) shall be binding upon all of the Seller Parties, and no
Seller Party shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise
contest the same. Buyer and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on the
actions taken by the Seller Representative without independent inquiry into
the capacity of the Seller Representative to so act and each such party is
hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for acts done by them in
accordance with any such decision, act, consent or instruction. All actions,
notices, communications and determinations by the Seller Representative to
carry out such functions shall conclusively be deemed to have been authorized
by, and shall be binding upon, the Sellers. Neither the Seller Representative
nor any of its partners, members, officers, managers, directors, employees,
counsel, consultants, advisors, agents or other representatives shall have any
liability to the Sellers (or any of their respective Affiliates or any Person
acting on behalf of any of the foregoing) with respect to actions taken or
omitted to be taken by the Seller Representative in such capacity (or any of
its officers, directors, employees, counsel, consultants, advisors, agents or
other representatives in connection therewith), except with respect to the
Seller Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Seller
Representative will at all times be entitled to rely on any directions
received from the Majority Holders; provided, however, that the Seller
Representative shall not be required to follow any such direction, and shall
be under no obligation to take any action in its capacity as Seller
Representative based upon any such direction. The Seller Representative shall
be entitled to engage such counsel, experts, advisors, consultants, agents and
other representatives as it shall deem necessary in connection with exercising
its powers and performing its functions hereunder and (in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Seller Representative)
shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such
Persons in all matters. The relationship created herein is not to be construed
as a joint venture or any form of partnership between or among the Seller
Representative or any Seller for any purpose of U.S. federal or state law,
including federal or state Tax purposes. Neither the Seller Representative nor
any of its Affiliates owes any fiduciary or other duty to any Seller.

   

10.20Seller Representative Expense Amount. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay
the Seller Representative Expense Amount to the Seller Representative by wire
transfer of immediately available funds as provided in Section 1.04(c). The
Seller Representative (for itself, and for its partners, members, officers,
managers, directors, employees, agents and representatives) shall maintain the
Seller Representative Expense Amount for the benefit of the Sellers, and shall
be entitled to utilize such funds to pay any and all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances (including fees and disbursements of its counsel,
experts, advisors, consultants, agents and other representatives) incurred by
the Seller Representative in such capacity (or any of its officers, directors,
partners, members, managers, employees, counsel, experts, advisors,
consultants, agents or other representatives in connection therewith), and to
full indemnification against any loss, liability or expenses arising out of
actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as Seller Representative
(except for those arising out of the Seller Representative's gross negligence
or willful misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation,
defense, settlement or adjudication of claims, from the Sellers (including
from funds paid to the Seller Representative under this Agreement and/or
otherwise received by it in its capacity as Seller Representative, or funds to
be distributed to the Sellers under this Agreement at its direction, pursuant
to or in connection with this Agreement (including under the Escrow Agreement,
but only at such time as any remaining amounts in the Escrow Fund would
otherwise be distributable to the Sellers under the terms of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement) (the "Representative Expenses"). For the avoidance
of doubt, any indemnification in favor of the Seller Representative shall be
borne solely by the Sellers. In furtherance of the foregoing, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Seller Representative shall
have the power and authority to set aside and retain additional funds paid to
or received by it, or direct payment of additional funds to be paid to the
Sellers pursuant to this Agreement at Closing or thereafter (including to
establish such reserves as the Seller Representative determines in good faith
to be appropriate for Representative Expenses that are not then known or
determinable). To the extent that the funds set aside or reserved by the
Seller Representative exceed the amount of Representative Expenses ultimately
incurred by the Seller Representative, such excess shall be returned to the
Sellers in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement. The
Sellers will not receive any interest or earnings on the Seller Representative
Expense Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Seller
Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any
such interest or earnings. The Seller Representative will not be liable for
any loss of principal of the Seller Representative Expense Amount other than
as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. As soon as
practicable following the completion by the Seller Representative of its
duties hereunder, the Seller Representative will deliver the unused portion of
the Seller Representative Expense Amount (if any) to the Sellers.
