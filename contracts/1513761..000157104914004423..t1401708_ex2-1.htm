all of the Company Notes and Company Warrants for shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Class B Common Stock in accordance with the plan of
recapitalization described in _Schedule 2.1_ shall in no event constitute the
failure to satisfy any condition of any Party to consummate the Closing.

forth in this Agreement and in the Certificate of Merger, and in accordance
with the Laws of the Republic of Panama, at the Effective Time, (a) Merger Sub

Time, on the third (3rd) Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement contained
in _Article VIII_ (other than conditions which, by their nature, are to be

conditions at Closing), or on such other date as may be agreed upon in
writing by Parent and the Company (the date on which the Closing occurs is
herein referred to as the "Closing Date"); _provided_ , that in no event
shall Parent be obligated to consummate the Closing if the Marketing Period
has not ended prior to the time that the Closing would otherwise have

the

  



    

22 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

final day of the Marketing Period; _provided_ , that if the Marketing Period
has ended and such date in the foregoing clause (ii) would cause the
Closing to occur after the Outside Date, then the Closing shall for purposes
of the foregoing clause (ii) occur on the Outside Date; subject to, in each
case, the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth
in _Article VIII_ (other than conditions which, by their nature, are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions at Closing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, as of any date,
the Marketing Period would commence but for the failure of the condition
to Closing set forth in _Section 8.2(f)_ to be satisfied as of such date (the
"Special Commencement Date"), then if in the event that the Debt Financing
Sources have notified Parent in writing that (1) as of such date, the Debt
Financing Sources will be ready, willing and able to fund the Debt Financing
on the terms set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments notwithstanding the
failure of the condition to Closing set forth in _Section 8.2(f)_ and the
corresponding condition in the Debt Financing Commitments to be satisfied and
at such time all of the other conditions to Closing set forth in this
Agreement have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), the Marketing Period shall
commence and (2) following the successful completion of the Marketing Period,
the Debt Financing Sources (A) reaffirm in writing that they are ready,
willing and able to fund the Debt Financing on the terms set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitments notwithstanding the failure of the condition to Closing
set forth in _Section 8.2(f)_ and the corresponding condition in the Debt
Financing Commitments to be satisfied and at such time all of the other
conditions to Closing set forth in this Agreement have been satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing), and (B) fund the Debt Financing on such terms, then Parent agrees
that it shall be obligated to consummate the Merger on the terms set forth in
this Agreement subject to the conditions set forth herein (other than the
condition to Closing set forth in _Section 8.2(f)_ hereof). The Parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that, if at any period of time following the
Special Commencement Date and prior to the Closing, the Debt Financing
Sources either indicate in writing or otherwise give Parent reasonable cause
to determine that they are no longer willing to fund the Debt Financing on
the terms set forth under the Debt Financing Commitments unless and until they
are otherwise so obligated to do so under the terms of the Debt Financing
Commitments, the Marketing Period shall be deemed not to have commenced (and
the Company acknowledges and agrees that any failure to consummate the Merger
in such circumstances shall not in and of itself constitute a breach of the
terms hereof by Parent or give rise to any termination right by the Company
hereunder). All proceedings to be taken and all documents to be executed and
delivered by all Parties at the Closing shall be deemed to have been taken
and executed simultaneously, and no proceedings shall be deemed taken nor any
documents executed or delivered until all have been taken, executed and
delivered.

Agreement, at the Closing, the Parties will cause a certificate of merger in
the proper legal form required under the Laws of the Republic of Panama and

and substance reasonably

avoidance of doubt, Company Options that are not Eligible Options shall be
cancelled immediately prior to the Closing, the holders of such Company
Options shall not be entitled to receive any payments or consideration
whatsoever with respect to such Company Options as a result of the Merger or
the cancellation of such Company Options, and the Company shall have no
further obligation with respect to such Company Options.

  



  

(C) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take, or cause to
be taken, all such actions as are necessary or appropriate in connection with
the termination and cancellation of all Company Options. All stock option
plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be terminated prior to or as

therefor and shall cease to exist.

  



  

(c) _Treatment of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Person, each share of capital stock of Merger Sub that
is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation (and the shares of the Surviving Corporation into which the
shares of Merger Sub capital stock are so converted shall be the only shares
of the Surviving Corporation's capital stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately after the Effective Time). From and after the Effective Time,
each certificate evidencing ownership of a number of shares of Merger Sub
capital stock will evidence ownership of such number of shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

appropriate Certificate(s), and a duly executed Letter of Transmittal by such
Company Stockholder.

  



  

(vi) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,

reasonably satisfactory to

  



    

28 
---

Parent and the Paying Agent by the Person claiming such document to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will pay or deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed document the applicable portion of the

or Company Class B Common Stock evidenced by such Certificate.

  



  

(b) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional Parent Ordinary Shares
will be issued in connection with the Merger, but in lieu thereof, any Person
who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a Parent Ordinary Share
(after aggregating for each particular Certificate all fractional Parent

amount in cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product
of (i) such fraction and (ii) the Parent Share Price.

  



  

(c) _Escrow Amount_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the other provisions of this _Article III_ , on the Closing Date, Parent

indemnification, compensation and reimbursement obligations under _Sections
10.2_ and _10.4_ , and shall be held and distributed in accordance with
_Sections 10.5 _ and _10.6_. The adoption of this Agreement and the approval
of the principal terms of the Merger by the Company Stockholders shall
constitute, among other things, approval of the Adjusted Escrow Amount, the
withholding of the Adjusted Escrow Amount by Parent and the appointment of
the Stockholders' Representative.

  



  

(d) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section 3.2_ , none of the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto
shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
applicable Law. Each holder of a Certificate or Company Option who has not
theretofore complied with the exchange procedures set forth in and
contemplated by this _Section 3.2_ shall look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar applicable
Laws) for his, her or its claim, only as a general unsecured
creditor thereof, to any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration
payable or issuable pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ in respect of such
Certificate or Company Option. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, if any Certificate or Company Option has not been
surrendered prior to the earlier of the first anniversary of the Effective
Time and such date on which the applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration payable or issuable pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ in respect of
such Certificate or Company Option would otherwise escheat to, or become the
property of, any Governmental Entity, any amounts payable in respect of such
Certificate or Company Option shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Parent, but remain subject to claims or interests
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

3.3 _No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Common Stock,
Company Class B Common Stock or Company Options_. The applicable portion of
the Aggregate Merger Consideration paid or payable and issued or issuable
following the surrender for exchange of the Certificates and Company Options
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be paid or payable or
issued or issuable in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Class B Common Stock represented by
such Certificates or issuable pursuant to such Company Options, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Class B Common Stock or
Company Options that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or document or
instrument representing a Company Option is presented to the Surviving

cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

  



  

3.4 _Section 883 Limitation_. The Company agrees and
acknowledges that each Company Securityholder receiving Per Share Stock
Consideration will abide by all provisions contained in Parent's memorandum of
association and bye-laws, which includes limitations and notice requirements
with respect to a Company Stockholder's receipt and ownership, holding, or
disposition of Per Share Stock Consideration. Such restrictions may include
the transfer of Parent Ordinary Shares so as to limit a Company Stockholder's
ownership percentage of Parent to no more than 4.9%, unless Parent's
memorandum of association and bye-laws expressly allow such Company
Stockholder to own more than 4.9% of Parent; _provided_ , that Parent shall
grant a waiver of such provisions of Parent's memorandum of association and
bye-laws, effective as of the Closing, to the Company Stockholders set forth
on _Schedule 3.4_ , so long as any such Company Stockholder's ownership of
Parent Ordinary Shares will not cause Parent to no longer qualify for the
benefits of Section 883 of the Code.

  



  

3.5 _Closing Deliveries._

  



  

(a) _Deliveries by the Company to Parent at Closing_. At the
Closing, the Company shall deliver, or shall cause to be delivered, to

terminated such Related Party Contracts providing that no further payments
are due, or may become due, under or in respect of any such
terminated Related Party Contract and that there are no outstanding
liabilities, claims or rights under any such Related Party Contract (it being
understood that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
while the Company shall be required to exercise its reasonable best efforts
to effect the Pre-Closing Recapitalization in accordance with _Section 2.1_ ,
the failure to secure (x) the exchange of all of the Company Notes and
Company Warrants for shares of Company Common Stock or Company Class B
Common Stock in accordance with the plan of recapitalization described in
_Schedule 2.1_ or (y) related customary releases concerning such Company
Notes and Company Warrants shall in no event constitute the failure to satisfy
any condition of any Party to consummate the Closing).

  



  

(b) _Deliveries by Parent at Closing_. Parent shall deliver, or
shall cause to be delivered:

  



  

(i) at the Closing, to the Paying Agent for further payment to each

(ii) at the Closing, to the Escrow Agent, (x) by wire transfer of

the Aggregate Note Payoff Amount, _less _ the cash portion of the Adjusted
Escrow Amount, _less_ the Representative Holdback Amount;

  



  

(iv) at or promptly following the Closing, to the Company

3.6 _Contingent Payments._

  



  

(a) _Delivery of Proposed Contingent Payment Amount Statement_.
Within ten (10) Business Days following the receipt of Parent's audited
financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015, Parent
shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the Stockholders' Representative
a statement setting forth Parent's good faith calculation of the 2015 Total
Net Revenue and the proposed amount of the Contingent Payment (the "Proposed
Contingent Payment Amount") that Parent will be required to pay to the Paying
Agent (for further distribution to the Company Securityholders) pursuant to
_Section 3.6(c)_ , if any (the "Proposed Contingent Payment Amount
Statement"). In connection with the delivery and review of any Proposed
Contingent Payment Amount Statement, each of Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative shall make itself and, as applicable, its Representatives
available during normal business hours, upon the reasonable request of the
other party, to discuss the Proposed Contingent Payment Amount Statement.

  



  

(b) _Objections and Disputes; Resolution Procedures_.

  



  

(i) The Stockholders' Representative shall have thirty (30) calendar
days following the date on which any Proposed Contingent Payment Amount
Statement is delivered by Parent (the "Review Period") in which to notify
Parent in writing (the "Objection Notice") of any good faith disagreement
with the Proposed Contingent Payment Amount Statement. The Objection Notice
shall set forth in reasonable detail (A) the items or amounts with which the
Stockholders' Representative disagrees and the basis for such disagreement
(which disagreement shall be limited to mathematical errors or the asserted
failure of such calculation of the Proposed Contingent Payment Amount to be
made in accordance with the terms of this _Section 3.6_ and the related
defined terms) and (B) the Stockholders' Representative's proposed
adjustments to the Proposed Contingent Payment Amount Statement. If the
Stockholders' Representative delivers a written acceptance of the Proposed
Contingent Payment Amount Statement at any time during the Review Period or
does not deliver an Objection Notice within the Review Period, the
Stockholders' Representative shall be deemed to agree in all respects with
the Proposed Contingent Payment Amount Statement and the items and amounts
reflected thereon (including the Proposed Contingent Payment Amount) shall be
final and binding on the Parties.

  



  

(ii) If an Objection Notice is properly and timely delivered to
Parent, Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall use good faith
efforts to resolve their differences with respect to the Objection Notice
within thirty (30) calendar days after Parent's receipt of the Objection
Notice. If Parent and the Stockholders' Representative resolve their
differences with respect to the Proposed Contingent Payment Amount Statement
within such thirty (30) day period, the Proposed Contingent Payment Amount
Statement shall be immediately modified as necessary to reflect such
agreement and, as so modified, shall be final and binding on the Parties.

  



  

(iii) Any differences with respect to the Objection Notice not
resolved by Parent and the Stockholders' Representative within such thirty
(30) day period shall be submitted for the purpose of resolving such dispute
to BDO USA, LLP (and if BDO

  



    

32 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

USA, LLP is unwilling or unable to serve in such role, then another
nationally recognized independent accounting firm as may be agreed upon by
Parent and the Stockholders' Representative) (the "Independent Auditor").
Parent and the Stockholders' Representative agree to execute, if requested by
the Independent Auditor, a reasonable engagement letter in customary form
and reasonably cooperate with the Independent Auditor so as to enable it to
make such determination as quickly and as accurately as practicable. The
Independent Auditor shall be instructed to render its decision solely on those
items or amounts on the Proposed Contingent Payment Amount Statement as to
which the Stockholders' Representative has, in the Objection Notice,
disagreed and which remain in dispute (the "Disputed Items"). The Independent
Auditor shall be instructed to deliver to Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative, as promptly as practicable, but no later than forty-five (45)
calendar days after the Independent Auditor is engaged, a written report
setting forth its resolution and, if applicable, its calculation of the
Disputed Items. In no event shall the Independent Auditor's determination
result in a Contingent Payment that is greater than that set forth in the
Objection Notice or less than that set forth in the Proposed Contingent
Payment Amount Statement. The parties shall promptly comply with all
reasonable requests by the Independent Auditor for information, books, records
and similar items. The fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor
(including reasonable attorney fees and expenses of the Independent
Auditor) incurred pursuant to this _Section 3.6(b)(iii)_ , shall be split
equally between the Company Stockholders (to be paid out of the
Representative Holdback Amount) and Parent. The determination of the
Independent Auditor as to any Disputed Items shall: (x) be set forth in a
written statement delivered to Parent and the Stockholders' Representative;
(y) subject to the following clause (z), be final, conclusive, binding,
nonappealable and incontestable by the parties hereto and each of their
respective Affiliates and successors and permitted assigns; and (z) not be
subject to collateral attack for any reason other than manifest error or
fraud.

  



  

(c) _Contingent Payment Amount_.

  



  

(i) Subject to the terms of _Section 3.6(b)_ , if the 2015 Total Net
Revenue is:

  



  

(1) equal to or in excess of the Contingent Payment Threshold but
less than the Contingent Payment Target, then Parent shall pay (or cause to
be paid) to the Paying Agent (for further distribution to the Company
Securityholders) an amount equal to (A) $25,000,000 _plus_  (B) (x) a
fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the 2015 Total Net Revenue
_minus_ the Contingent Payment Threshold, and the denominator of which is an
amount equal to the Contingent Payment Target _less_ the Contingent Payment
Threshold,  _multiplied by_ (y) $25,000,000; or

  



  

(2) equal to or in excess of the Contingent Payment Target, then
Parent shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the Paying Agent (for
further distribution to the Company Securityholders) $50,000,000 in the
aggregate (the amount payable under clauses (1) or (2), the
"Contingent Payment").

  



    

33 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (I) during the period from Closing until
December 31, 2015, Parent agrees to operate the Surviving Corporation in the
ordinary course of business consistent in all material respects with past
practice (including by setting a 2015 budget and operating plan in a manner
materially consistent with _Exhibit A_ , unless otherwise agreed by the
Stockholders' Representative) and (II) (A) if at any time from the Closing
until December 31, 2015, Parent fails to operate the Surviving Company in the
ordinary course of business consistent in all material respects with past
practice or (B) any Company Securityholder who continues as an officer or
employee of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (or any
employee that reports to such Person) takes one or more actions with respect
to the business of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries in material
contravention of (x) the Surviving Corporation's 2015 budget and operating
plan or (y) a direction of the Surviving Corporation's board of directors,
and, in any such case, any such actions set forth in the preceding clauses (I)
or (II) have the effect of increasing or decreasing 2015 Total Net Revenue,
then the amount of 2015 Total Net Revenue shall be equitably adjusted
accordingly in a manner to neutralize the impact of such actions. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall (x) Parent be obligated to make
a Contingent Payment in excess of $50,000,000 in the aggregate or (y) Parent
be obligated to make any Contingent Payment if the 2015 Total Net Revenue is
less than the Contingent Payment Threshold.

  



  

(ii) To the extent that the Contingent Payment is required to be paid
pursuant to this _Section 3.6(c)_ , Parent shall pay (or cause to be paid)
(x) the portion of such Contingent Payment payable to the former Company
Securityholders (other than the former holders of Company Class B Common
Stock), to the Paying Agent (for further distribution to the Company
Securityholders (other than the former holders of Company Class B Common
Stock)), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more
accounts designated by the Paying Agent and (y) the portion of such
Contingent Payment payable to the former Company Optionholders, to the
Surviving Corporation (for further distribution to the former Company
Optionholders), in each case in cash on April 1, 2016 (unless there has not
been a final determination of the amount of the Contingent Payment as of such
date, in which case, payment shall be made promptly following the final
determination thereof).

  



  

(d) _Non-Transferability_. The rights of the Company
Securityholders in and to the Contingent Payment are not transferable, and the
Company Securityholders shall not, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer,
assign, donate, contribute, pledge, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise
dispose of such rights or any economic or other interest therein (any such
transaction, a "Transfer") to any Person;  _provided_ , that notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) each Company Securityholder that is not a natural Person
shall be permitted to Transfer such rights or interests to such Company
Securityholder's Affiliates and (ii) each Company Securityholder that is a
natural person shall be permitted to Transfer such rights or interests to any
Member of the Immediate Family of such Company Securityholder or for estate
planning purposes.

  



    

34

--- 

    



  

(e) _Payments_. The Stockholders' Representative, on behalf of
the Company Securityholders, acknowledges and agrees that there is no
assurance that any Contingent Payment will be earned.

  



  

(f) _Tax Effect_. Subject to Section 483 of the Code, any
payments made pursuant to this _Section 3.6_ shall constitute an adjustment
to the Aggregate Merger Consideration for Tax purposes and shall be treated as
such by Parent and the Company Securityholders on their respective Tax
Returns.

  



  

3.7 _Withholding_. Parent and the Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this  _Article III_ such amounts as they are required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision
of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law, including any withholding from
any payment that is treated as wages or compensation for the performance of
services; _provided_ , that (A) Parent and the Company agree to provide two
(2) Business Days' notice prior to withholding on payments to Company
Securityholders that are not natural Persons and will cooperate with such
Company Securityholders to avoid such withholding and (B) that any applicable
withholding with respect to any payment with respect to Company Options that
is paid in a combination of cash and Parent Ordinary Shares shall be
effectuated by withholding on a pro rata basis from the cash and Parent
Ordinary Shares otherwise payable with respect to such Company Option (with
such withholding in respect of the payment of Parent Ordinary Shares effected
by withholding therefrom a number of Parent Ordinary Shares with a fair
market value equal to the amount of withholding taxes required (i.e. on a "net
settlement" basis). To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

from Barclays Bank PLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities
LLC, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch
and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (as the same may be amended or replaced
pursuant to _Section 7.5(a)_ , which amendments or replacements shall also be
provided, the "Debt Financing Commitments"), pursuant to which the financial
institutions party thereto (collectively with any financial institutions that
otherwise commit to provide or provide the Debt Financing Commitments, the
lenders and prospective purchasers of any debt securities contemplated by the
Debt Financing Commitments, including any debt financing sources and any
arranger or agent for such debt financing, together, in each case, with their
respective Affiliates, and the respective officers, directors, employees,
partners, trustees, shareholders, controlling persons, agents and
representatives of the foregoing and their respective successors and assigns,

to lend the debt amounts set forth therein (the "Debt Financing"). The Debt

warranties or obligations under this Agreement, in either

fees or other fees in connection with the Debt Financing Commitments that
are payable on or prior to the date hereof and Parent will pay when due all
other commitment fees arising under the Debt Financing Commitments as and

case, such that the closing conditions set forth in _Section 8.2_ would
fail to be satisfied, (y) compliance by the Company with _Section 7.5(e)_ ,

Financing Commitments, the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Debt

7.1 _Access and Confidentiality._

  



  

(a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall authorize and permit Parent and its Representatives
to have reasonable access during normal business hours upon reasonable notice
to (i) the facilities and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including the Company Vessels, for, among other purposes, the conduct of
appraisals and environmental and compliance related assessments, (ii) the
properties, Contracts, books and records relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including working papers and data in the possession of the
Company's or its Subsidiaries' or their respective independent
public accountants, internal audit reports, and "management letters" from
such accountants with respect to the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries'
systems of internal control) ( _provided_ , that the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not be required to afford such access or furnish such
documents if such access or disclosure would reasonably be expected to
result in the loss of attorney-client privilege, it being understood that if
any information is withheld by the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to
the foregoing, the Company shall inform Parent as to the general nature of the
information being withheld) and (iii) the officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. During such period, the Company shall furnish as promptly as
practicable such information concerning the businesses, properties and
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent shall
reasonably request. All requests for access to such facilities, assets,
properties, books and records and other information shall be made to such of
the Company's Representatives as the Company shall designate, who shall be
responsible for coordinating and shall coordinate all such requests and all
access permitted hereunder. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
generally keep Parent informed as to all material matters involving the
operations and businesses of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries.
Any information provided to Parent or its Representatives in accordance with
this _Section 7.1_ shall be subject to the terms of the confidentiality
agreement dated June 24, 2014, between Parent and the Company (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"). Subject to the limitations and restrictions
set forth in, and without expanding the obligations of the parties under, this
_Section 7.1_  and Law, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent to facilitate the planning of the integration of the
parties and their respective business after the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) The Parties acknowledge that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Each of
the Company and Parent agrees that it, its Affiliates and its Representatives
shall hold the terms of this Agreement, and the fact of this Agreement's
existence, in strict confidence until the transactions contemplated hereby are
jointly publicly announced by the Parties. At no time shall any Party
disclose any of the non-public terms of this Agreement or any non-
public information about the other Party to any other Person without the
prior written consent of the Party about which such non-public information
relates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, each of
the Company and Parent shall be permitted to disclose any and all terms of
this Agreement to its financial, tax and legal advisors (each of whom is
subject to a similar obligation of

  



    

67 
---

confidentiality), and to the extent necessary in compliance with applicable
Law and the rules of NASDAQ.

  



  

(c) Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release, public filing or other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, prior to the Closing, shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public filing or public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by Law, court
process or the rules and regulations of any national securities exchange or
national securities quotation system; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply to any release or other public statement to the
extent containing information that is consistent with and does not contain any
material new information or departures from the joint press release referred
to above or any other release or public statement previously issued or made in
accordance with this _Section 7.1(c)_. The parties hereto agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby following execution of this Agreement shall be in the form
heretofore agreed to by Parent and the Company. Except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement (including the first sentence of this _Section
7.1(c)_ ) or as required by Law, no Party shall issue any press release or
make any public filing or public statement regarding the other Party or the
other Party's operations, directors, officers or employees without obtaining
the other party's prior written consent. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
in this _Section 7.1(c)_ shall restrict any disclosure of information made by
or on behalf of the Company or any of its Affiliates to any direct or indirect
investors in any such Person or any disclosure by any such Person of a
general description of the transaction in connection with the normal
fundraising and related marketing, informational or reporting activities of
such Person. The Parties shall consult and coordinate with each other

contemplated by _Section 7.4(a)_ , _7.4(b)_ and _7.4(d)_ , the failure to
obtain any such amendments, consents or waivers (in and of itself) shall in no
event constitute the failure to satisfy any condition of any Party to
consummate the Closing.

  



  

7.5 _Cooperation with Financing._

  



  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Debt Financing at Closing (giving effect to the timing
of the Marketing Period) on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Financing Commitments; _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may (x) amend
the Debt Financing Commitments to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement and, in connection
therewith, amend the economic and other arrangements with respect to existing
and additional lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities, (y) amend the Debt Financing Commitments to implement any
flex provisions applicable thereto or (z) otherwise replace or amend, or
agree to any waivers in respect of, the Debt Financing Commitments, so long
as, in each case, (A) such action would not reasonably be expected to
materially delay or prevent the Closing or impair the availability of the Debt
Financing Commitments or reduce the aggregate amount of cash proceeds
available to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
to pay all amounts payable by Parent in connection with this Agreement on the
Closing Date, (B) the terms thereof are not less beneficial to Parent and
Merger Sub, with respect to conditionality or enforcement, or less beneficial
to the Company, than those in the Debt Financing Commitments as in effect on
the date of this Agreement and (C) such action does not in any way alter the
pricing or other economic terms of the Debt Financing Commitments as in
effect on the date hereof, other than pursuant to any reallocation of
the economics as a result of the addition of any lenders, agents or titles
described in clause (x) of this paragraph or to implement any flex

provisions applicable to the Debt Financing Commitments. Such reasonable
best efforts shall include using reasonable best efforts to:

necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by

with _Article IX_ (including with respect to any backstop commitment,
maintaining such commitment until such time as the Financing Consent has been
received);

  



  

(iv) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and
Merger Sub in the Debt Financing Commitments and the Definitive
Financing Agreements that are within its control (including by consummating
the Debt Financing when required pursuant to the terms of the Debt Financing
Commitments and this Agreement) and otherwise comply with its obligations
thereunder;

  



  

(v) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms
and conditions (including, to the extent the same are exercised, the
flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments (the
"Definitive Financing Agreements");

  



  

(vi) if all of the conditions to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations
under _Section 8.2_ (other than those conditions that, by their terms, will
be satisfied on the Closing Date) have been satisfied or waived and the
Marketing Period has ended, consummate the Debt Financing at Closing; and

  



  

(vii) if a Tolling Event occurs, use reasonable best efforts to remedy
such Tolling Event as soon as reasonably practicable; and

  



  

(viii) cause the Debt Financing Sources and other persons providing Debt
Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Debt Financing required
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including by taking enforcement action to cause such Debt Financing Sources
and other Persons providing the Debt Financing to fund such Debt Financing.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice (and in any event within two
(2) Business Days after obtaining knowledge) of: (A) any breach or default
(or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by
any party to any Debt Financing Commitment or Definitive Financing Agreement,
(B) the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
person with

repudiation by any party to any Debt Financing Commitment or Definitive
Financing Agreement or (y) material dispute or disagreement between or among
any parties to any Debt Financing Commitment or Definitive
Financing Agreement, (C) any Debt Financing Commitment or Definitive
Financing Agreement, as applicable, expiring or being terminated for any
reason, (D) any Debt Financing Source that is a party to any Debt Financing
Commitment notifying Parent that such source no longer intends to provide
financing to Parent on the terms set forth therein, and (E) for any reason
Parent no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all of
the financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments on the terms
described therein. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event
within two (2) Business Days after the date the Company delivers to Parent or
Merger Sub a written request, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance
referred to in clauses (A) to (E) of the immediately preceding sentence.
Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing,
including as to the Financing Election. 

  



  

(c) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the

Debt Financing Commitments, or if any Debt Financing Commitment shall be
terminated, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event (and no later than the
earlier of (1) the last calendar day of the Marketing Period and (2) the
Business Day immediately prior to the Outside Date) and, if obtained, to
provide the Company with a copy of such new financing commitment; it being
understood that Parent shall have no obligation to accept terms that
are materially less favorable, taken as a whole (after taking into account
any flex provisions), to Parent than those included in the Debt Financing
Commitments as of the date hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, the
definitions of "Debt Financing Commitments," "Debt Financing" and related
definitions shall include the Debt Financing Commitments and any
document related thereto as the same may be amended, waived, modified or
replaced pursuant to this _Section 7.5_.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts

_provided_ that such cooperation is consistent with applicable Law),
including:

  



  

(i) causing its and its Subsidiaries' management teams, with
appropriate seniority and expertise, to participate in, including the

Agreement by the Company or from information provided in writing by the
Company and its Representatives).

  



  

(h) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable best efforts to (i) periodically update any Required Information
provided by them or on their behalf as may be necessary so that such Required

or goodwill of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(j) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.5_ to the contrary,
in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub have any obligation to seek the

the identity of the Person making the same.

all such steps as may be required to cause any acquisitions of Parent

7.8 _Preparation of Information Statements._

  



  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than fifteen (15)
Business Days) following the date of this Agreement, Parent will, with the
assistance of the Company, prepare and file with the SEC an information
statement of the type contemplated by Rule 14c-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (such documents, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the
"14C Information Statement"). Parent and the Company will cooperate
with each other in the preparation of the 14C Information Statement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company will furnish to Parent
the information relating to it and its Subsidiaries required by applicable Law
to be set forth in the 14C Information Statement. Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect to the 14C
Information Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt
thereof and to have the 14C Information Statement cleared by the staff of the
SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing. Each of the
Company and Parent agrees to correct any information provided by it for use
in the 14C Information Statement which is or becomes false or misleading.
Parent will as soon as reasonably practicable notify the Company of receipt
of any comments from the SEC with respect to the 14C Information Statement
and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the 14C Information Statement
or for additional information and will provide the Company with copies of all
such comments and correspondence. Prior to filing or mailing the 14C
Information Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding
to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto,
Parent will provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and to
propose comments on such document or response. Promptly after Parent has
resolved all comments to the 14C Information Statement to the satisfaction of
the SEC staff or after ten (10) calendar days have passed since the date of
filing of the preliminary 14C Information Statement with the SEC without
notice from the SEC of its intent to review the 14C Information Statement,
Parent will promptly file with the SEC the 14C Information Statement in
definitive form as contemplated by Rule 14c-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act substantially in the form previously cleared or filed with the SEC, as
the case may be, and cause a copy of the 14C Information Statement to be
mailed to each shareholder of Parent.

  



  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than thirty (30)
calendar days) following the date of this Agreement, Parent will, with the
assistance of the Company, prepare and mail to the Company Securityholders a
statement related to the issuance of Parent Ordinary Shares to the Company
Securityholders in compliance with Regulation D in respect of any investor
that does not meet the definition of "accredited investor" (as defined
therein) pursuant to the terms hereof, as required by applicable Law (the
"Company Securityholders Statement" and together with the 14C Information
Statement, the "Information Statements"). Each of the Company and Parent
agrees to correct any information provided by it for use in such statement
which is or becomes false or misleading. Prior to mailing such statement (or
any amendment or supplement thereto), Parent will provide the Company a
reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document.

  



  

7.9 _Reservation of Parent Ordinary Shares and NASDAQ Listing_.
Effective at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall reserve (free from
preemptive rights) out of its reserved but unissued Parent Ordinary Shares,
the number of Parent Ordinary Shares included in the Aggregate Stock

81 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

the Parent Ordinary Shares to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
listing on NASDAQ at or prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

7.10 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification._

  



  

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
all current or former directors and officers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, together with such person's heirs, executors or
administrators, a "Covered Person") against any claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, fines, fees, costs or expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred in connection with any
Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, incurred or
suffered by such Covered Person by reason of: (i) any act or omission or
alleged act or omission performed or omitted to be performed on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise in connection with the
business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (ii) the fact that he
or she is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, in each case, to the fullest extent that the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary, or Parent, as the case may be, would have been
permitted, under applicable Law, indemnification agreements existing on the
date of this Agreement or the organizational or governing documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement, to
indemnify such Covered Person (and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, indemnification agreements, and organizational or
governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries).
Without limiting the foregoing, all rights to indemnification and exculpation
(including the advancement of expenses) from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing (including with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby) existing as of the date hereof in favor of
the Covered Persons, as provided in the organizational or governing documents
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and pursuant to
applicable Law shall survive the transactions contemplated hereby and shall
continue in full force and effect without amendment, modification or repeal in
accordance with their terms for a period of not less than six (6) years after
the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any actual or threatened Action
arising out of matters prior to the Closing Date (each a "DandO Claim") is
asserted or made within such period, all rights to indemnification and
exculpation (including the advancement of expenses) hereunder in respect of
any such DandO Claim shall continue, without diminution, until final resolution
of any and all such claims.

  



  

(b) At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall acquire tail
policies to the current directors and officers liability insurance of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Existing Policies"), covering the Covered
Persons, from a reputable and financially sound carrier and in a form
acceptable to the Stockholders' Representative (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld), which tail policies shall (i) be effective for a
period from the Closing Date through and including the date that is six (6)
years after the Closing Date; (ii) be on terms substantially comparable in
all respects to the Existing Policies; and (iii) contain minimum aggregate
limits of liability for directors and officers liability insurance coverage
for directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries with the
amount of coverage at least equal to that of the Existing Policies and
deductibles no larger than those customary for such type of insurance
coverage. Following the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide copies of such policies to the past,
current and future directors and

  



    

82 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries entitled to benefit thereof as
reasonably requested by such Persons from time to time.

  



  

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that the Covered Persons may have
certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance
provided by other Persons. Parent hereby agrees (i) that Parent and the
Surviving Corporation are the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., their
obligations to the Covered Persons are primary and any obligation of such
other Persons to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same
expenses or liabilities incurred by any such Covered Person are secondary),
(ii) that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be required to advance
the full amount of expenses incurred by any such Covered Persons and shall be
liable for the full indemnifiable amounts, without regard to any rights any
such Covered Person may have against any such other Person and (iii) that
Parent irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases (and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to irrevocably waive, relinquish and release) such
other Persons from any and all claims against any such other Persons for
contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect
thereof. Parent further agrees that no advancement or payment by any of such
other Persons on behalf of any such Covered Person with respect to any claim
for which such Covered Person has sought indemnification from Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall affect the foregoing and such other Persons shall
have a right of contribution or be subrogated to the extent of such
advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of such Covered
Person against Parent and the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.10_ shall survive consummation
of the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, the Covered Persons.

  



  

7.11 _Employee Matters._

  



  

(a) _Company Employees_. For purposes of this _Section 7.11_ , the
term "Company Employees" shall include, with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, all full-time and part-time employees, employees on workers'
compensation, maternity leave, or disability and employees on other approved
leaves of absence with a legal or contractual right to reinstatement.

  



  

(b) _Continuing Employees_. During the one year period following
the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to provide
each of the Company Employees who continue in employment with the Company and
its Subsidiaries following the Closing (each, a "Continuing Employee") with
annual base compensation or wages, as applicable, and employee
benefits (other than under any defined benefit pension plans and equity
compensation plans and arrangements) that are at least as favorable, in the
aggregate, to those provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries. From and after the
Closing Date, Parent shall (or shall cause one of its Affiliates to) use
reasonable best efforts to provide the Continuing Employees with service
credit for all purposes (other than benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension plan) under any employee benefit plan that is maintained, sponsored,
contributed to or required to be contributed to or entered into by Parent or
any of its Affiliates for the benefit of any current or former employee,
officer or other service provider of Parent or any of its Affiliates to the
same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled to

  



    

83 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

service credit under any equivalent Employee Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall
use reasonable best efforts to ensure that any employee benefit plans
sponsored by Parent shall not deny Continuing Employees (or their eligible
dependents) who participate in such employee benefit plans coverage on the
basis of a pre-existing condition or actively-at-work requirement (except to
the extent such pre-existing condition or actively-at-work requirement applied
under a similar Employee Plan immediately prior to such Continuing Employee's
(or eligible dependents') eligibility for such employee benefit plan), and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the employee benefit plans
sponsored by Parent to credit Continuing Employees (and their eligible
dependents) for any deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket expenses paid
in the plan year in which the Closing occurs prior to the Closing, to the
same extent such credit was given for the current plan year, under a similar
Employee Plan. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor all Employee Plans and each written Contract
set forth on _Schedule 4.10(a)_ between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Continuing Employees, on the other
hand, in accordance with their respective terms. The provisions of this
_Section 7.11(b)_ shall not apply to the extent that application would result
in a duplication of benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement (i) shall require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries to continue to employ any particular Company Employee or (ii)
shall be construed to prohibit Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any employee benefit plan of
the Parent, the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c) _Section 280G_. (i) No later than five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall solicit and use reasonable best efforts
(which shall not require the payment of compensation) to obtain from each
Person who is, with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, a
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code)
that has a right to any payments or benefits or potential right to any
payments or benefits that would be deemed to constitute "parachute payments"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) a waiver of such Person's
rights to any such payments or benefits (the "Waived 280G Benefits") so that
all remaining payments or benefits applicable to such Person shall not be
deemed to be "excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code), in each case to the extent such waiver is not obtained prior to
the date hereof, and (ii) if any such waiver is obtained, no later than three
(3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, solicit and use reasonable best
efforts (which shall not require the payment of compensation) to obtain the
approval of the Company Stockholders, to the extent and in the manner
required under Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder, in order to pay any Waived 280G
Benefits (the "280G Approval"). The Company shall provide drafts of such
waivers and such stockholder approval materials to Parent for its review,
comment and approval prior to obtaining such waivers and soliciting such
approval, and the Company shall consider and not unreasonably omit any changes
or comments thereto requested by Parent. The Company shall not pay any of
the Waived 280G Benefits if such waived payment is not approved by the
Company Stockholders as contemplated above. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent copies of each executed waiver described
above that has been obtained as well as evidence that a vote of the
Company Stockholders was solicited in accordance with the provisions of this

their obligations under _Article X_ , except to the extent that the Company
Stockholders are actually and materially prejudiced thereby.

  



  

(ii) The Stockholders' Representative shall have the right, at the
expense of the Company Stockholders to the extent such Tax Claim is subject
to indemnification by the Company Stockholders pursuant to _Article X_ and the

Claim described in Section 7.2(b)(ii), Parent shall control and diligently
prosecute such Tax Claim at the expense of the Company Stockholders pursuant

not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and (B) the

resolved prior to the due date of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be
filed in the manner which the Party responsible for preparing such Tax Return
deems correct; _provided_ that if the position of the Company Stockholders is
accepted in whole or in part by the Independent Auditor, then Parent shall
amend such Tax Return to be consistent with the Independent Auditor's
determination if requested by the Stockholders' Representative.

  



  

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

or sharing agreements, policies, arrangements and practices of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall be terminated prior to the Closing Date. After
such date, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Company Stockholders,
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates will have any further rights or
liabilities thereunder.

  



  

(f) _Tax Elections_. Parent shall not, without the prior consent of
the Stockholders' Representative (which may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, withhold such consent), make, or cause to permit to be made, any
Tax election pursuant to Section 338 of the Code.

  



  

(g) _Exclusivity_. In the event of a conflict between the
provisions of this _Section 7.12,_ on the one hand, and the provisions of
_Section 10.5_ , on the other, the provisions of this _Section 7.12_ shall
control.

  



  

7.13 _Director and Officer Resignations_. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain resignations, effective as of the Closing,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent from the directors,
managers and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as requested by

this Agreement), (ii) the Marketing Period has ended and the Closing shall
not have occurred on or before the date required by _Section 2.4_ , (iii) the
Company has sent irrevocable written notice to Parent after clauses (i) and

(a) _Termination_. In the event that this Agreement shall be
terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of
any Party under this Agreement; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, (a) no such termination shall relieve any Party hereto of any
liability for damages to the other party hereto resulting from any willful
and knowing breach of this Agreement prior to such termination, and (b) the
obligations of the Parties contained in _Section 7.5(g)_ and this _Section
9.3_ and _Sections 11.1_ , _11.2_ , _11.3_ , _11.5_ , _11.6_ ,  _11.7_ ,
_11.8_ , _11.9_ , _11.10_ , _11.12_ , _11.13_ , _11.14_ , _11.16_ , _11.17_
and _11.18_  and all provisions of this Agreement necessary for the
interpretation and enforcement thereof shall survive any such termination.

  



  

(b) _Termination Fee_. If the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_ or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1(b)_ at a time when the Company would have been entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_ , then in either case,
Parent shall, promptly, but in any event within five (5) Business Days, pay a
fee of $88,900,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee") in cash to the Company or
an account or accounts designated by the Company by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

  



  

(c) If Parent fails to pay the Parent Termination Fee in accordance
with this _Section 9.3_ on or prior to the date such amount is due
hereunder, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences an
Action that results in a final, nonappealable judgment against Parent for the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 9.3_ , Parent
shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company its reasonable and documented,
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in
connection with such Action, together with interest on such amount of the
Parent Termination Fee at an annual rate equal to the prime rate as published
in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such
amounts were originally due hereunder which shall accrue from such date
through the date payment is actually delivered to the Company or its designee,
and the costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by the
Company in connection with such action or proceeding.

  



  

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the recovery of the Parent
Termination Fee as set forth herein shall constitute payment of liquidated
damages and not a penalty and that such liquidated damages amount is
reasonable in light of the substantial but indeterminate harm anticipated to
be caused by Parent's material breach or default under this Agreement, the
difficulty of proof of loss and damages, the inconvenience and non-
feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy and the value of the
transactions to be consummated hereunder.

anything to the contrary herein, if the Company terminates this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 9.1(f)_ or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 9.1(b)_ at a time when the Company would have been entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_ , then, in either case,
other than with respect to any indemnification or expense reimbursement
obligations of Parent under _Section 7.5(g)_ , (i) in the case of a
termination of this Agreement in which the Parent Termination Fee is payable
in accordance with _Section 9.3(b)_ , the Company's sole and exclusive remedy
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) shall be the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_ (together
with any other amounts payable to the Company in accordance with _Section
9.3(c)_ ), (ii) the Company shall not be entitled to specific performance
under _Section 11.15_ of Parent's obligation to consummate the Closing (it
being understood that the foregoing shall not impair the rights of the Company
to seek specific performance pursuant to _Section 11.15_ prior to any
termination of this Agreement) and (iii) none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, members, shareholders or
Representatives shall have any other remedy (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against Parent, its Affiliates and other
direct and indirect investors, and each of their respective Representatives
or any Debt Financing Source, its Affiliates and other direct and indirect
investors, and each of their respective Representatives for any Losses
suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement in this Agreement (whether willfully, knowingly, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise) or other failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated (whether willfully,
knowingly, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or
on behalf of the Company against any such Person, by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any
applicable Law, or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) the Parties
agree that, for purposes of this _Section 9.3(e)_ , the Stockholders'
Representative shall not have any rights, nor shall it be able to enforce any
remedies, that are unavailable to the Company and (y) it is agreed and
acknowledged that no Party shall have any rights under this Section 9.3(e)
unless expressly provided for herein.

disregarded and given no effect for purposes of determining whether any
breach thereof, inaccuracy therein or any Losses have occurred, and the amount
of such Losses;

  



  

(b) any breach or nonperformance by the Company prior to the Closing
of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

(c) any Action asserted or threatened by (i) any Company
Securityholder relating to or arising out of (x) the Pre-Closing
Recapitalization, (y) this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the
consummation of the Merger, or (z) any alleged misallocation of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration (including payments made by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation at the direction of the Stockholders' Representative or
the Company) or the failure of the Note Payment Schedule or the Option
Payment Schedule to be true and correct in all respects, (ii) any Company
Securityholder for payment relating to equity securities or debt of the
Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including any payment related to the Company Notes or the Company Warrants,
and (iii) any holder of Company Options or other equity compensation awards,
including stock appreciation rights, of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for payment of a portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, related to
any such option or equity compensation award of the Company or its
Subsidiaries; and

  



  

(d) any Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof (and any
predecessors thereof) resulting from a failure by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to be eligible for the exclusion from gross income under Section
883(a)(1) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder in the
current taxable year or in a Pre-Closing Tax Period or in a portion of any
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date in which such exclusion was
claimed by the Company or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

10.3 _Indemnification by Parent_. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this _Article X_ , from and after the Closing, Parent shall
indemnify and defend each of the Company Securityholders (collectively, the
"Stockholder Indemnitees") against, and shall hold each of them harmless from
and against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all
Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the Stockholder Indemnitees
based upon, arising out of or by reason of:

  



    

94 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the Parent Specified
Representations or any failure of such Parent Specified Representations to be
true and correct as if it was made on the Closing Date (except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date);
_provided_ , that if any Parent Specified Representation is qualified or
limited based on materiality, including the terms "material," "Parent
Material Adverse Effect" or any similar materiality or similar qualification
or limitation, such qualification or limitation shall in all respects be
disregarded and given no effect for purposes of determining whether any
breach thereof, inaccuracy therein or any Losses have occurred, and the amount
of such Losses; and

  



  

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or
obligation to be performed by Parent pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

10.4 _Certain Limitations_. The indemnification provided for in
_Sections 10.2_ and _10.3_ shall be subject to the following limitations:

  



  

(a) The aggregate amount of all Losses for which the Company
Securityholders shall be liable pursuant to _Section 10.2_ shall not exceed
the aggregate cash and Parent Ordinary Shares then available in the Escrow
Account (the "Cap").

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Company Securityholders shall not have any obligation to indemnify any Parent
Indemnitee pursuant to _Section 10.2_ , unless and until the aggregate amount
of all such individual Losses incurred or sustained by all Parent Indemnitees
with respect to which the Parent Indemnitees would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification under _Section 10.2_ exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Threshold
Amount"), and then only to the extent such Losses exceed the
Threshold Amount.

  



  

(c) The aggregate amount of all Losses for which Parent shall be
liable pursuant to _Section 10.3_ shall not exceed $88,900,000.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Parent
shall not have any obligation to indemnify any Stockholder Indemnitee pursuant
to  _Section 10.3_ unless and until the aggregate amount of all such
individual Losses incurred or sustained by all Stockholder Indemnitees with
respect to which the Stockholder Indemnitees would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification under _Section 10.3_  exceeds the Threshold Amount, and then
only to the extent such Losses exceed the Threshold Amount.

  



  

(e) The Company Stockholders shall have no right of contribution or
other recourse against the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries or their
respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents, attorneys,
representatives, assigns or successors for any claims asserted by Parent
Indemnitees.

  



  

(f) The limitations set forth in this _Section 10.4_ shall not apply
in the case of fraud, criminal activity or willful breach.

  



  

10.5 _Indemnification Procedures_. The party making a claim under this
_Article X_ is referred to as the "Indemnified Party," and the party against
whom such claims are asserted under this _Article X_ is referred to as the
"Indemnifying Party". The Stockholders'

  



    

95 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Representative shall exercise on behalf of the Company Securityholders all of
their rights under this _Section 10.5_ to the extent the
Company Securityholders are the Indemnifying Parties.

  



  

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice
of the assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any
Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to
this Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing, other than any Action
with respect to a Tax matter that is governed by _Section 7.12_ (a "Third
Party Claim"), against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the
Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide indemnification under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30)
calendar days after receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim. The
failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. Such notice by
the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable
detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and
shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss
that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving written notice to
the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at
the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying Party's own counsel,
and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense;
_provided_ , that such assumption and control of the defense of such Third
Party Claim shall be deemed to be an acceptance and assumption of the
liability of such Third Party Claim by the Indemnifying Party and an
admission that any Losses arising from such claim are indemnifiable Losses
for which the Indemnifying Party is liable hereunder; _provided_ ,  _further_
, that if the Indemnifying Party are the Company Securityholders, such
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or direct the defense
of any such Third Party Claim that (i) the Indemnified Party reasonably
believes that it would bear a larger portion of the Losses relating to the
claim than the Indemnifying Party due to the Cap, (ii) seeks an injunction or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, or (iii) relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal or quasi-criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation. In the event that the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to _Section
10.5(a)_ , it shall have the right to take such action as it deems
necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining
to any such Third Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified
Party; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party acknowledges that
notwithstanding its assumption of the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall be the party entitled to the indemnification rights.
The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of
any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the
Indemnifying Party's right to control the defense thereof. The fees and
disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that if in the reasonable opinion of counsel
to the Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses available to an
Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a conflict of interest between
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
one counsel to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction for which the
Indemnified Party reasonably determines counsel is required. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim,
fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to
defend as provided in this Agreement, or fails to diligently prosecute the
defense of such Third Party Claim, the

  



    

96 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Indemnified Party may, subject to _Section 10.5(b)_ , pay, compromise, defend
such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based
upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim.

  



  

(b) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into
settlement of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
Parent of the Stockholders' Representative, as applicable, except as provided
in this _Section 10.5(b)_ ; _provided_ that if a firm offer is made to settle
a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a
financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle such Third
Party Claim in its reasonable discretion. If the Indemnified Party has
assumed the defense pursuant to _Section 10.5(a)_ , it shall not agree to any
settlement without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account
of a Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct
Claim") may be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying
Party written notice thereof. The failure to give such written notice shall
not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced thereby. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the
Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material
written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days
after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim.
The Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional
advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the
Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect
of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying
Party's investigation by giving such information and assistance (including
access to the Company's premises and personnel and the right to examine and
copy any accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of
its professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party
does not so respond within such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified
Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the
Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement.

  



  

10.6 _Payments_. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or
finally determined to be payable pursuant to this _Article X_ , (a) if
Parent is the Indemnifying Party, Parent shall satisfy its obligations within
ten (10) Business Days of such final, non-appealable determination by wire
transfer of immediately available funds as directed by the Stockholders'
Representative and (b) if the Company Securityholders are the Indemnifying
Party, any payments the Company Securityholders are obligated to make to any
Parent Indemnitee pursuant to this _Article X_ shall be paid solely from the
Escrow Account (any such payments to be allocated between the cash and
Parent Ordinary Shares then held in the Escrow Account on a pro rata basis
based on the relative value of such cash and Parent Ordinary Shares as
determined in accordance with this _Section 10.6_ ) to the Parent Indemnitees
to the extent there are sufficient

  



    

97 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

assets in the Escrow Account (with respect to the Parent Ordinary Shares held
in the Escrow Account, by the release of a number of Parent Ordinary
Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the amount of such Loss
by (ii) the average closing price of the Parent Ordinary Shares on the five
trading days immediately preceding the date of such payment from the Escrow
Account by the Escrow Agent pursuant to a joint written instruction from the
Stockholders' Representative and Parent in accordance with this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement).

  



  

10.7 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the purchase price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

  



  

10.8 _Exclusive Remedies_. Subject to _Article III_ and except for
breaches of payment obligations by one party to the other party pursuant to
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that, following the Closing, their sole and exclusive monetary remedy
with respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud,
criminal activity or willful breach in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) for any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article X_. Nothing in this
_Section 10.8_ shall limit any Person's right to seek and obtain any
equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled or to seek any remedy
on account of any party's fraud, criminal activity or willful breach.

11.2 _Amendments; Waivers_. This Agreement, including any Exhibit or
Schedule, may be amended, modified or supplemented only by agreement in
writing of the Parties. No waiver of any provision nor consent to any
exception to the terms of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing
and signed by the Party to be bound and then only to the specific purpose,

11.2_ , _Section 11.5_ ("Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of
Jury Trial"), _Section 11.8_ ("Parties in

consent of the Debt Financing Sources shall be required before any such
amendment or waiver may become effective.

pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall
constitute a part of this Agreement.

  



  

11.4 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Closing, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
interest in, to and under, or possession of, all assets, property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, the officers and directors
of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized, in the name and on behalf
of the Company or otherwise, to take all lawful action necessary or desirable
to accomplish such purpose or acts, so long as such action is not inconsistent
with this Agreement.

  



  

11.5 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial._

  



  

(a) Any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or related to
this Agreement and any other document or instrument delivered pursuant hereto,
including the existence, validity, interpretation or breach hereof (whether
in contract or tort and whether in equity, law or statute) shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without
regard to choice or conflicts of law doctrines; _provided_ , that the Merger
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the Republic
of Panama and without regard to choice or conflicts of law doctrines. Each
of the Parties hereto (w) irrevocably agrees that all Actions (whether in
contract or tort and whether in equity, law or statute) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement shall be exclusively resolved in the
Delaware Court of Chancery, or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction,
any Federal or state court sitting in Delaware, (x) consents to submit itself
to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, or, if such
court shall not have jurisdiction, any Federal or state court sitting in
Delaware in connection with any such Action (whether in contract or tort and
whether in equity, law or statute) that arises out of this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (y) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court and (z) agrees that it will not bring
any Action relating to this Agreement in any court other than the Delaware
Court of Chancery, or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any Federal
or state court sitting in Delaware, unless venue would not be proper
under rules applicable in such courts. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, each Party acknowledges and irrevocably agrees (i) that any
Action, whether in contract or tort, at law or in equity or otherwise,
involving any Debt Financing Source arising out of, or relating to, the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Debt Financing Commitments, the Debt
Financing or the performance of services thereunder or related thereto shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New
York and shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
of the State of New York, County of New York, or if under applicable Law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate
courts thereof) in the County of New York and each Party submits for itself
and its property with respect to any such Action to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court and agrees not to bring (or permit any of its

  



    

100 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing) any such Action in
any other court, (ii) that service of process, summons, notice or document by
registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses provided in
_Section 11.1_ ("Notices") shall be effective service of process against it
for any such Action brought in any such court, (iii) to waive and hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Action in any such
court, (iv) that a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Law and (v) the Debt Financing Sources are
express third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any provisions in this
Agreement reflecting the foregoing agreements.

  



  

(b) _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a
trial by jury in respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out
of, under or in connection with this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby, including with respect to any Action that
involves the Debt Financing Sources. Each Party (i) certifies that no
Representative or agent of any other Party has represented, expressly or
otherwise, that such other Party would not, in the event of litigation, seek
to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other
Parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 11.5(b)_.

  



  

11.6 _Headings_. The descriptive headings of the Articles, Sections
and subsections of this Agreement are for convenience only and do not
constitute a part of this Agreement.

  



  

11.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendment hereto or any
other agreement (or document) delivered pursuant hereto may be executed in one
or more counterparts and by different Parties in separate counterparts. All
of such counterparts shall constitute one and the same agreement (or other
document) and shall become effective (unless otherwise provided therein) when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each Party and delivered to the
other Party. A signed copy of this Agreement delivered by facsimile, e-mail
or other means of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the same
legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this Agreement.

  



  

11.8 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of each Party and their permitted assigns and
successors, and except as set forth in _Article III_ (which from and after the
Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of the Company Securityholders),
_Section 7.5(g)_ , _Section 7.10_ , _Article X_ and _Section 11.18_ , nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other
Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Stockholders' Representative shall not
be entitled to any rights or be able to enforce any remedies under or by
reason of this Agreement in its capacity as a Company Securityholder by
virtue of it being a Party hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Debt
Financing Source is an express third party beneficiary of _Section 9.2_
("Effect of Termination"), _Section 11.2_ ("Amendments; Waivers"),  _Section
11.5_ ("Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial"),
_Section 11.18_ ("Non-Recourse") and this _Section 11.8_.

  



    

101 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

11.9 _Waiver_. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise or
delay in exercising any right hereunder shall be deemed a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise preclude any further or other exercise
of such or any other right.

  



  

11.10 _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any Governmental Entity,
the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement to the extent permitted
by Law shall remain in full force and effect; _provided_ , that the essential
terms and conditions of this Agreement for the Parties remain valid, binding
and enforceable; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the economic and legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any Party. In event of any such
determination, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement to fulfill as closely as possible the original intents and purposes
hereof. To the extent permitted by Law, the Parties hereby to the same
extent waive any provision of Law that renders any provision hereof prohibited
or unenforceable in any respect.

  



  

11.11 _[Reserved]._

  



  

11.12 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Schedules
and Exhibits hereto and the other Transaction Documents, (a) constitutes the
entire agreement among the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and
(b) supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings,
both oral and written, of the Parties in connection therewith, except for the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect until
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (whereupon the Parties agree the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate).

  



  

11.13 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Company and
Parent shall each pay its own expenses incident to the evaluation of the
Company and the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the
negotiation, preparation and performance of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the fees, expenses
and disbursements of their respective investment bankers, accountants and
counsel.

  



  

11.14 _No Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights or
obligations under it are assignable by either Party without the prior written
consent of the other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of Parent or
Merger Sub may (x) assign or otherwise transfer its rights and
obligations hereunder to any Subsidiary of Parent, which assignment or
transfer shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, of
its obligations hereunder, (y) collaterally assign in whole or in part, this
Agreement to one or more of its financing sources and (z) assign any and all
of its rights under this Agreement to a purchaser of all or a material part of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The assigning Party shall
remain liable to the other Parties for all obligations of the assigning Party
hereunder, including the payment of the consideration set forth herein,
notwithstanding a permitted assignment. Any assignment in violation of this
provision shall be void and of no effect.

  



  

11.15 _Specific Performance._

  



  

(a) The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by
Parent, Merger Sub or the

  



    

102 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Company in accordance with the terms hereof or were otherwise breached by
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company. Except as set forth in _Section 11.15(b)_
with respect to the obligation of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
Closing, the Parties further agree that, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity, each of Parent, Merger Sub and
(subject to _Section 11.15(b)_ ) the Company shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions without the necessity of posting a bond to
prevent or cure breaches of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and to
specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
including _Section 11.15(a)_ , it is explicitly agreed that the
Company's right to seek an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief to enforce Parent's obligation to consummate the Closing
shall be available only prior to the termination of this Agreement and only in
the event that (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ and
_Section 8.2_ have been satisfied or waived in writing (other than (x) those
conditions that by their nature would be satisfied at the Closing, each of
which is, at the time of termination of this Agreement, capable of being
satisfied if the Closing were to occur at such time or (y) the failure of
which to be satisfied is primarily the result of the material breach of
Parent's representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this
Agreement), (ii) either the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments (or alternative debt financing) has been funded or will be
funded at the Closing in accordance with its terms, (iii) the Marketing
Period has ended and the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the
date the Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section 2.4_ , (iv) the

brought against such Persons by any Company Securityholder, regardless of
the legal theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be
imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in
equity, or otherwise, unless such Persons took or omitted taking any action in
bad faith or as result of willful misconduct. The Stockholders'
Representative shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to recover from
any amounts withheld by the Stockholders' Representative for such purpose,
its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the performance of its duties
hereunder. Each successor Stockholders' Representative shall have all the

Representative" as used herein shall be deemed to include any successor
Stockholders' Representative. Any successor Stockholders' Representative
shall indicate in writing its acceptance of such appointment and its agreement
to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. The adoption of this Agreement
and the approval of the principal terms of the Merger by the Company
Stockholders shall constitute approval of the appointment of the
