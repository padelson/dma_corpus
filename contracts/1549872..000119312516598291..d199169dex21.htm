over the exercise price per share of each such Company Option; and (B) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Option;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the exercise price per share of any such
Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such
Company Option shall be canceled and terminated without any cash payment being
made in respect thereof.

thereafter (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter), an
amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for any required
withholding Tax as contemplated in _Section 1.9_) equal to the product of (A)
the Merger Consideration and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company RSU; _provided_ that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any Vested
Company RSU which immediately prior to such cancellation was treated as
"deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on
the applicable settlement date for such Vested Company RSU if required in
order to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

 



4 (c) _Company DSUs_. Neither Merger Sub nor Parent shall assume any Company DSU
or substitute for any Company DSU any similar award for Merger Sub or Parent
stock, in connection with the Merger or any other Transactions. As of
immediately prior to and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time
and without any action on the part of any holder of any Company DSU, (i) all
Unvested Company DSUs outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall fully vest and become Vested Company DSUs, and (ii) each Company
DSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled at the Effective Time, and, in exchange therefor, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay to each former holder of any such Company DSU, at the
Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event
later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter), an amount in cash (without
interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax as
contemplated in _Section 1.9_) equal to the product of (A) the Merger
Consideration and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company DSU; _provided_ that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any Company DSU which
immediately prior to such cancellation was treated as "deferred compensation"
subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the applicable settlement
date for such Company DSU if required in order to comply with Section 409A of
the Code.

 

(d) _Treatment of Company ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Company Board will adopt such resolutions and take such

those in effect on the date of this Agreement (other than to discontinue
their participation in the ESPP), (B) no offering period will be commenced
after the date of this Agreement, (C) any offering period under the ESPP that

Agreement (and such shares shall be treated as other outstanding shares in
accordance with _Section 1.5_ of this Agreement); and (D) the ESPP shall be
terminated, effective as of, or prior to, the Effective Time.

necessary.

Section 1.7 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to
all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. No further registrations or transfers of Company Common
Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Payment Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, they
shall be marked canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in _Section 1.8_
below.

 



5 Section 1.8 _Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust
company to act as payment agent in the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ "). On

for the purpose of exchanging Merger Consideration for Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing
Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares and excluding Company 102 Awards and
Company 102 Shares, in respect of which payment shall be transferred directly
to the 102 Trustee), cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 1.5_. The cash amount so deposited
with the Payment Agent is referred to as the " _Payment Fund_." The Payment
Agent will invest the funds included in the Payment Fund in the manner
directed by Parent; _provided, however_ , that such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available). Any interest or other income resulting from the
investment of such funds shall be the property of Parent.

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with the 102 Trustee, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration payable with respect to Company Shares issued or issuable
with respect to Company Equity Awards granted and subject to Tax under
Section 102(b)(2) and Section 102(b)(3) of the ITO and held by the 102 Trustee
(the " _Company 102 Shares_ " and " _Company 102 Awards_ ," respectively), on
behalf of holders of Company 102 Awards in accordance with Section 102 of the
ITO, the Interim Option Tax Ruling and the Option Tax Ruling, if obtained,
pursuant to _Section 4.20_ (the " _102 Amounts_ "). The 102 Amounts shall be
held in trust by the 102 Trustee pursuant to the applicable provisions of
Section 102 of the ITO, the Interim Option Tax Ruling and the Option Tax
Ruling, if obtained, and shall be released by the 102 Trustee in accordance
with the terms and conditions of Section 102 of the ITO and the Option Tax
Ruling, if obtained.

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more
than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Shares (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) (A) a letter
of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or
transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Payment Agent), (B) if the Interim
Option Tax Ruling or the Option Tax Ruling or the Withholding Tax Ruling
is/are obtained pursuant to _Section 4.20_, such form(s) of any other
declaration required thereunder to be delivered by the holders of Company
Shares and/or Company Equity Awards, in which the beneficial owner of Company
Shares provides certain information necessary for Parent to determine, in its
reasonable discretion, whether any amounts need to be withheld from the
Merger Consideration payable to such beneficial owner pursuant to the terms of
the ITO (in each case, subject to the provisions of this _Section 1.8_,
_Section 1.9_, and _Section 4.20_), the Code, or any provision of state,
local, Israeli or foreign Law, and/or (C) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for the Merger Consideration.

 



6 (d) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares
or Dissenting Shares) shall, upon (A) surrender to the Payment Agent of
Certificates for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, and
the applicable declaration for Tax withholding purposes and/or a Valid Tax
Certificate, or (B) compliance with the reasonable procedures established by
the Payment Agent for delivery of Book-Entry Shares, shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect
thereof and the Certificates so surrendered and Book-Entry Shares so
transferred shall forthwith be canceled, subject to _Section 1.9_ and
_Section 4.20_. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable
upon due surrender of the Certificates or due transfer of the Book-Entry
Shares. The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment
Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
normal exchange practices. Until so surrendered or delivered, as the case may
be, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, any Merger Consideration payable in respect of
Company 102 Shares and Company 102 Awards shall be transferred by Parent to
the 102 Trustee, for the benefit of the beneficial owners thereof, and be
released by the 102 Trustee to the beneficial holders of such Company
102 Shares, in accordance with the requirements of Section 102 of the ITO and
the Interim Option Tax Ruling and the Option Tax Ruling, in accordance with
this _Section 1.8(d)_.

 

(e) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Payment Agent will issue the Merger Consideration in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate. Delivery of such
affidavit and the posting of such bond shall be deemed delivery of a
Certificate with respect to the relevant Common Shares for purposes of this
_Article I_.

(f) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration
in respect of the applicable Shares may be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificates so surrendered or the Book-Entry Shares
so transferred are registered if such Certificates shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Shares shall be
properly transferred and, in each case, the Person requesting such payment
shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration in respect thereof or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation and the Payment Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable.

 

(g) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed or undistributed to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as of the date that is one (1)
year after the Closing Date shall be delivered to or as directed by the
Surviving Corporation upon demand, and

 



7  any such holder who has not previously complied with this _Article I_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of any such
holders claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of any Certificate or to
any other Person with respect to any Merger Consideration delivered to any
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property Law, escheat Law
or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time when the amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the
Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(h) Any portion of the Payment Fund made available to the Payment Agent to pay
for Dissenting Shares shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation upon
Demand.

Section 1.9 _Withholding Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each of the Payment
Agent, 102 Trustee, Merger Sub, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (each, a
" _Payor_ ") shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration or other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it reasonably determines are required to be deducted or
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority by Payment Agent,
Merger Sub, Parent and the Surviving Corporation, from such consideration
under the Code, ITO, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law or
under any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 1.9(a)_, with respect to
Israeli Taxes, the Merger Consideration (together with any adjustment)
payable to each payment recipient (other than holders of Company 102 Shares,
Company 102 Awards and Company Awards subject to Tax pursuant to Section 3(i)
of the ITO) shall be retained by the applicable Payor for the benefit of
each such payment recipient for a period of one-hundred eighty (180) days
from the Closing Date or an earlier date required in writing by a payment
recipient (the " _Withholding Drop Date_ ") (during which time unless
requested otherwise by the ITA or by the Withholding Tax Ruling, no payments
shall be made by a Payor to any payment recipient and no amounts for Israeli
Taxes shall be withheld from the payments deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement, except as provided below and during which time each payment
recipient may obtain a Valid Tax Certificate). If a payment recipient
delivers, no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Withholding Drop
Date, a Valid Tax Certificate to a Payor, then the deduction and withholding
of any Israeli Taxes shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of
such Valid Tax Certificate and the balance of the payment that is not withheld
shall be paid to such payment recipient (subject to withholding on account of
non-Israeli Taxes, if applicable). If any payment recipient (i) does not
provide a Payor with a Valid Tax Certificate by no later than three (3)
Business Days before the Withholding Drop Date, or (ii) submits a
written request to the Payor to release such payment recipients portion of
the Merger Consideration (together with any adjustment) prior to the
Withholding Drop Date and fails to submit a Valid Tax Certificate no later
than three (3) Business Days before such time, then the amount to be withheld
from such

 



8  payment recipients portion of the Merger Consideration (together with any
adjustment) shall be calculated according to the applicable withholding rate
as reasonably determined by Payor in accordance with applicable Law, which
amount shall be increased by the interest plus linkage differences as defined
in Section 159A of the ITO for the time period between the fifteenth (15th)
calendar day of the month following the month during which the Closing Date
occurs and the time the relevant payment is made, and calculated in NIS based
on a U.S. dollars to NIS exchange rate not lower than the effective exchange
rate at the Closing Date.

 

(c) Any withholding made in New Israeli Shekels with respect to payments made
hereunder in U.S. dollars shall be calculated based on a conversion rate not
lower than applicable rate on the Closing Date and in such a manner as the
Parent reasonably determines to be in compliance with the applicable Law and
any currency conversion commissions will be borne by the applicable
payment recipient and deducted from payments to be made to such payment
recipient.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of  _Section 1.9(a)_ or _Section
1.9(b)_, no amounts will be deducted or withheld under the ITO in connection
with payments of any Merger Consideration made to non-Israeli residents that
hold Company Equity Awards; provided that such payment recipients provide
Payor prior to any payment to them with a valid and executed declaration
regarding their non-Israeli residence, in the form agreed to by Parent and the
Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of  _Section 1.9(a)_,
_Section 1.9(b)_, and _Section 1.9(c)_ with respect to withholding Taxes
pursuant to the ITO shall apply with respect to payments of any consideration
made to non-Israeli residents that hold Company Equity Awards subject to Tax
under Section 102(b)(2) and Section 102(b)(3) of the ITO if such payment
recipients fail to provide Payor with such declaration.

 

Section 1.10 _Appraisal Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Dissenting
Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 1.5(a)(i)_, but rather, the
holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to payment of the
appraisal value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld in
accordance with _Section 1.9_ with respect to such payment (and, at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holders
shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the appraisal value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL); _provided_ , that, if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be
paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (without interest thereon) as provided in  _Section
1.5(a)(i)_.

(b) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt written notice of (A) any demand
for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL or any other written communication with the Company that relates to a
demand for

 



9  appraisal or payment with respect to Dissenting Shares; (B) any withdrawal
or attempted withdrawal of any such demand; and (C) any other demand, notice
or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant
to the DGCL; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
or settlement offer or settle any such demands prior to the Effective Time
with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. Each holder of
Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled under Section 262 of the DGCL to
receive payment of the "fair value" for such holders shares shall receive
such payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation after giving effect to
any withholdings received by applicable Law (but only after the
amount thereof shall have been finally determined pursuant to the DGCL), and
such shares shall be retired and cancelled.

Section 1.11  _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger
Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name
of the Company and otherwise) to take and shall take such action.

Adverse Effect (excluding the exception in clause (vii) in the definition of
Company Material Adverse Effect).

organization are identified in _Section 2.4(a)_ of the Company Disclosure

Company or any Company Subsidiary to make contributions to the capital of, or
lend or advance funds to, any Company Subsidiary. There are no outstanding
obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any of the Company Subsidiary Securities. Except for Equity
Interests in the Company Subsidiaries or as set forth in _Section 2.4(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedules, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock and/or other voting securities of or
ownership interest in any Person.

the Exchange Act. 

 



14 (b) Each Company SEC Report that is a registration statement, as amended or

fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading.

(c) The consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements

Section 3.7 _No Other Company Representations or Warranties_. Except for
the representations and warranties set forth in _Article II_ , Merger Sub and

Section 3.8 _Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts,
Forward-Looking Statements and Business Plans_. In connection with the due
diligence investigation of the Company by Merger Sub and Parent and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives, Merger Sub and Parent and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives have received and may continue
to receive after the date hereof from the Company and its Affiliates and
Representatives certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking information, as well as certain business plan information, regarding
the Company and its business and operations. Merger Sub and Parent hereby
acknowledge and agree that: (a) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting
to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
statements, as well as in such business plans, with which Merger Sub and
Parent are familiar; (b) Merger Sub and Parent are taking full responsibility
for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such
business plans, so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
information or business plans); and (c) except in the case of fraud, Merger
Sub and Parent hereby waive any claim against the Company or any Company

respect to any information described in this _Section 3.8_, and have relied
solely on the results of their own independent investigation and on the
representations, warranties, agreements and covenants made by the Company and
contained in this Agreement. Accordingly, Merger Sub and Parent acknowledge
and agree that none of the Company nor any Company Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective Affiliates or Representatives,

 



33  has made or is making any express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements
or business plans (including the reasonableness of assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business
plans) except as set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

Parent and Merger Sub to rely thereon.

 

Section 3.9 _Financing_.

(i) the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, from the
Financing Sources (together with all exhibits, annexes, schedules and
attachments thereto, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and together with the
Redacted Fee Letter, the " _Debt Commitment Papers_ ") and the Redacted Fee
Letter, pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof,
the Financing Sources have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to
Parent and Merger Sub for the purpose of funding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Debt Financing_ "), and (ii) the
executed equity commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Equity
Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Debt Commitment Papers, the "
_Financing Commitments_ ") from certain funds affiliated with Siris Capital
Group, LLC (" _Sponsor_ ") pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, Sponsor has caused such funds to commit to invest the
amounts set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ " and, together with the
Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). The Equity Commitment Letter provides,
and will continue to provide until such time as this Agreement is terminated,
that the Company is a third party beneficiary thereof to the extent set forth
therein.

(b) As of the date hereof, each of the Financing Commitments (and each of the
respective obligations and commitments contained therein) is in full force and
effect and has not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect or
otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect, and, to Parents
Knowledge, no such withdrawal, termination, rescission, amendment, supplement
or modification is presently contemplated (other than amendments,
modifications or terminations that are permitted by  _Section 4.15_).
Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by each other party
thereto, each of the Financing Commitments is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Merger Sub and Parent and (in the case of the Debt Commitment
Papers only, to the Knowledge of Merger Sub and Parent), the other parties
thereto, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity principles.
Except for the Financing Commitments in the form delivered pursuant to
_Section 3.9(a)_ and any customary engagement letters and non-disclosure
agreements that do not impact the conditionality or amount of the Financing,
as of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements,
contracts or arrangements relating to the Financing or the Financing
Commitments, including any that could affect the conditionality or
availability of the Financing, to which Merger Sub, Parent, Sponsor or any of
their respective Affiliates is a party. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties in _Article II_ in all material respects, the
compliance and performance by the Company of its covenants and agreements set
forth in this Agreement in all material respects, to the Knowledge of Parent
and Merger Sub, as of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be
expected to (x) constitute a default

 



34  or breach on the part of Merger Sub, Parent or Sponsor and (in the case of
the Debt Commitment Papers only, to the Knowledge of Merger Sub and Parent)
any of the other parties thereto, under any term of the Financing Commitment,
(y) result in a failure of any condition of the Financing Commitments, or (z)
result in any portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable
in an amount equal to the Required Amount, Merger Sub and Parent have fully
paid (or caused to be fully paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees or
deposits required by the Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the
date hereof and will fully pay (or cause to be fully paid) any and all
commitment fees or other fees or deposits required by the Financing
Commitments to be paid after the date hereof. Assuming (i) the Financing is
funded in accordance with the applicable Financing Commitments and (ii) the
satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the
Merger (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at Closing), the aggregate net proceeds of the Financing (including after
giving effect to the maximum amount of flex, including original issue
discount flex, contemplated by the Debt Commitment Papers), when combined with
Parents and Merger Subs other sources of funds, will be sufficient for the
satisfaction of all of Merger Subs and Parents obligations under this
Agreement to be satisfied at or after Closing on the terms contemplated
hereby, including the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant
to _Section 1.8_, all amounts to be paid pursuant to  _Section 1.6_, the
payment of all associated fees, costs and expenses and all other amounts
(including the amount necessary to cause the Debt Payoff), in each case,
required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub at Closing pursuant to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Required
Amount_ "). There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related
to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the
Financing in an amount equal to the Required Amount or that would permit the
parties thereunder to reduce the total amount of the Financing to an amount
less than the Required Amount, in each case other than as expressly set forth
in the Financing Commitments. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to
Parents obligation to consummate the Merger (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), as of the date hereof,
neither Merger Sub nor Parent has any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the full amount of
the Financing will not be available to Merger Sub on the date of the Closing
or of any fact, occurrence or condition that makes any of the assumptions or
statements set forth in the Financing Commitments inaccurate in any material
respect.

Section 3.10 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent has delivered to the Company the Guarantee duly executed by the
Guarantors with respect to certain matters on the terms specified therein. The
Guarantee is in full force and effect and constitutes a valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of the Guarantors in favor of the Company (except as
such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity
principles), and no event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of a Guarantor under
such Guarantee.

Section 3.11 _Solvency_. Neither Merger Sub nor Parent is entering into this
Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors of the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries. Assuming the
satisfaction (or waiver) of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs
obligations to consummate the Merger as set forth herein, and after

 



35  giving effect to the Transactions, and payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.8_, all amounts to be paid pursuant to
_Section 1.6_, the payment of all associated fees, costs and expenses of the
Merger and the Financing (including (i) any repayment or refinancing of
Indebtedness of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries required in
connection therewith and (ii) after giving effect to the maximum amount of
flex, including original issue discount flex, contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Papers) and the payment of all other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions and to allow Merger Sub
and Parent to perform all of their obligations under this Agreement, and
assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Merger Subs and Parents
obligations to consummate the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will be
Solvent as of and after the Effective Time. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " means that, as of any date of determination
and with respect to any Person: (a) the fair value of the assets of such
Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is greater than the
total amount of liabilities, including contingent liabilities, of such Person
and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, (b) the present fair saleable
value of the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated
basis, is not less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liability of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, on
their debts and liabilities as they become absolute and matured, (c) such
Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are not engaged in
business or a transaction, and are not about to engage in business or a
transaction, for which such Persons and its Subsidiaries assets, on a
consolidated basis, would constitute unreasonably small capital, and (d) such
Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, do not intend to, and do
not believe that they will, incur debts or liabilities beyond their ability
to pay such debts and liabilities as they mature; _provided_ , _however_ , for
the purposes hereof, the amount of any contingent liability at any time shall
be computed as the amount that, in light of all of the facts
and circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that can
reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability (irrespective
of whether such contingent liabilities meet the criteria for accrual under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 5).

Section 3.12 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. None of Merger Sub or Parent
or any of their "affiliates" or "associates" is, or at any time during the
last three (3) years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. Prior to the Agreement Date,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub has taken, or authorized or permitted any
Representatives of Parent or Merger Sub to take, any action that would
reasonably be expected to cause, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
"affiliates" or "associates" to be deemed an "interested stockholder" as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

(15) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, and as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in any event
within twenty-five (25) Business Days following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement to be sent
to the holders of Common Shares relating to the meeting of the stockholders of
the Company (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") to be held to consider
adoption of this Agreement, approval of the Merger and approval of any other
matters to affect the transactions contemplated hereby as determined by the
Parties. Parent shall cooperate with the Company in connection with the
preparation of the Proxy Statement and shall furnish all information
concerning Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates as the Company may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement.
The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement
cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing.
The Company will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC.

 

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of (i) the receipt of any
comments from the SEC and all other written correspondence and oral
communications with the

 



40  SEC relating to the Proxy Statement and (ii) any request by the SEC for any
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or for additional information
with respect thereto and, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), the Company
shall promptly provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between it and
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement. All filings by the Company with the SEC in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Proxy Statement and
any amendment or supplement thereto and any response to any comments of the
SEC with respect thereto, shall be subject to the reasonable prior review and
comment of Parent, and all mailings to the stockholders of the Company in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be subject to the reasonable prior review and comment of
Parent and, in each case, the Company shall consider in good faith all
comments reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company shall not file or mail
any document relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting or respond to the
SEC prior to receiving the approval of Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, is discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

 

Section 4.4 _Company Stockholders  Meeting_. The Company shall, in accordance
with its Company Charter Documents and applicable Law (and regardless of
whether there has occurred Change in Company Board Recommendation), as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date on which the staff of
the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement or
that it does not intend to review the Proxy Statement, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of
seeking the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
stockholders of the Company and to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date on which the staff of
the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement or
that it does not intend to review the Proxy Statement and (ii) subject to
_Section 4.5_, solicit the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall,
through the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that they vote their
shares in favor of the Merger (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ") and
shall include such Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, except
to the extent that the Company Board shall have made a Change in Company
Board Recommendation as permitted by _Section 4.5_. The Company agrees that
its obligation to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this
_Section 4.4_ shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal
or by the making of any Change in Company Board Recommendation by

 



41  the Company Board, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
the Company of such obligation, subject to the ability of the Company Board to
take the actions set forth in  _Section 4.5(f)_. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, unless the Company Board shall have effected a
Change in Company Board Recommendation pursuant to, and in accordance with,
the terms of _Section 4.5_, then the Company Board shall submit this
Agreement to the Companys stockholders without a recommendation (although the
resolutions adopting this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement may not
be rescinded or amended), in which event the Company Board may communicate
the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the Companys stockholders in
the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
extent required by applicable Law. The Company shall not adjourn, postpone or
recess the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of
Parent and shall adjourn, postpone or recess such meeting as directed by
Parent in order to obtain a quorum or solicit additional votes (so long as
such meeting is not adjourned, postponed or recessed to a date on or after
the Outside Date). The Company shall not, unless required by applicable Law,
change the record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting without the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and any postponement or adjournment of the Company
Shareholders Meeting shall be effected, to the extent practicable, in a
manner that does not require the Company to establish a new record date. The
Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the applicable proxy solicitor of the Company to
advise Parent on a daily basis on each of the last ten Business Days prior to
the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting, as to the aggregate tally of
the proxies received by the Company with respect to the Company Shareholder
Approval.

the Company Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall cause its and the
Company Subsidiaries Representatives to, immediately cease any

Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law: (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and such Persons Representatives);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and such Person enter into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; and _provided further_ , that any

making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such
Acquisition Proposal.

the material terms and conditions of any proposal or offer or the nature of
any inquiries or contacts, and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably
informed of all material developments affecting the status and the material

to taking any such action, the Company complies with  _Section 4.5(g)_ of
this Agreement:

(i) effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation in response to a material
fact, event, change or development that (a) arises after the date hereof and
was not known to the Company Board as of or prior to the date hereof and (b)
does not involve or relate to an Acquisition Proposal, if the Company Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law;

 

(ii) effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation in response to an
Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and the Company
Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
financial advisor, that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal; and

(iii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 6.1(d)(iii)_ (and, if
applicable, enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement), if the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys financial advisor, constitutes a
Superior Proposal and the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to enter into such
definitive agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 4.5(f)_,
the Company shall not be entitled to: (i) make a Change in Company Board
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 4.5(f)(i)_ or _Section 4.5(f)(ii)_; or
(ii) terminate this Agreement (and, if applicable, enter into any Company
Acquisition Agreement) pursuant to _Section 4.5(f)(iii)_, unless in all such
instances: (A) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to
Parent that it is prepared to (x) make a Change in Company Board
Recommendation (a " _Recommendation Change Notice_ "), or (y) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1(d)(iii)_ in response to a Superior
Proposal (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ "), which notice shall, if the basis
for the proposed action by the Company Board is not related to a Superior
Proposal, contain a description of the events, facts and circumstances giving
rise to such proposed action or, if the basis for the proposed action by the
Company Board is a Superior Proposal, contain a description of the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, including a copy of

 



45  the Company Acquisition Agreement in the form to be entered into (it being
understood and agreed that the delivery of such notice shall not, in and of
itself, be deemed to be a Change in Company Board Recommendation); and (B)
Parent does not make, within three (3) Business Days after the receipt of such
notice, a binding proposal that would, in the good-faith judgment of the
Company Board (after consultation with outside counsel and, in the case of a
Superior Proposal, the Companys financial advisor), cause such events, facts
and circumstances to no longer form the basis for the Company Board to effect
a Change in Company Board Recommendation or cause the offer previously
constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal,
as the case may be; provided that during this three (3) Business Day period
the Company and its representatives shall, to the extent Parent desires
to negotiate, negotiate in good faith with Parent and its representatives.
Any material changes with respect to events, facts and circumstances mentioned
above, or material changes to the financial terms of such Superior Proposal,
as the case may be, occurring prior to the Companys effecting a Change in
Company Board Recommendation or terminating this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 6.1(d)(iii)_ shall require the Company to provide to Parent a new
Recommendation Change Notice or Superior Proposal Notice and a new three (3)
Business Day period.

(h) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, Rule
14e-2(a) and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act
or making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal if, in the good-faith judgment of the Company Board,
after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that
any such action taken or statement made that relates to an Acquisition
Proposal (other than a customary "stop, look and listen" communication by the
Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act) shall be deemed
to be a Change in Company Board Recommendation unless the Company Board
reaffirms the Company Recommendation in such statement or in connection with
such action.

 

Section 4.6 _Consents; Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the
limitations set forth in _Section 4.5_), the parties hereto will use their
respective commercially reasonable best efforts to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and to cause the conditions to the Merger set forth in
_Article V_ to be satisfied, including using commercially reasonable
best efforts to make or cause to be made, in cooperation with the other
parties hereto and to the extent applicable: (i) within ten (10) Business Days
after the Agreement Date, an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Merger; and (ii) as promptly
as practicable after the Agreement Date all other necessary filings, forms,
declarations, notifications, registrations and notices with other Governmental
Authorities under any other Antitrust Law relating to the Merger. Each party
shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to: (A) respond at the
earliest practicable date to any requests for additional information made by
the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, or any other
Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law relating to the Merger; (B) act
in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other party in connection with
any investigation by any Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law
relating to the Merger; (C) furnish to each other all information required for
any filing, form, declaration, notification, registration and notice under any
Antitrust Law relating to the Offer and the Merger, subject to advice of such
partys antitrust counsel; and (D) request early termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act and take all other actions reasonably necessary
consistent with this _Section 4.6_ to cause the 

 



46  expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR
Act or any other Antitrust Law relating to the Merger. In connection with the
foregoing, each party hereto shall use its commercially reasonable best
efforts: (w) to give the other party reasonable prior notice of any
communication with, and any proposed understanding or agreement with, any
Governmental Authority regarding any investigations, proceedings, filings,
forms, declarations, notifications, registrations or notices, and permit the
other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views
of the other in connection with, any proposed communication, understanding
or agreement with any Governmental Authority, in each case under any
Antitrust Law relating to the Merger, subject to advice of such partys
antitrust counsel; (x) not to participate in any meeting or conversation, or
engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filings or inquiry under any Antitrust Law relating to the
Merger, without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting or
conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the
opportunity to attend and/or participate therein; (y) if attending a meeting,
conference, or conversation with a Governmental Authority under any Antitrust
Law relating to the Merger, from which the other party is prohibited by
applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Authority from participating
in or attending, to keep the other reasonably apprised with respect thereto;
and (z) to consult and cooperate with the other party in connection with any
information or proposals submitted in connection with any proceeding, inquiry,
or other proceeding under any Antitrust Law relating to the Merger. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall each use its commercially
reasonable best efforts: (1) to avoid the entry of any Governmental Order;
and (2) to eliminate every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority so as to enable the Effective Time to
occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event, not later than the
Outside Date). Any fees and expenses (other than the attorneys, advisors and
agents fees) payable under the filings, registrations and declarations with
Governmental Authorities relating to the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be borne equally by the Company and Parent.

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Merger Sub, Parent and the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or
parties hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain and maintain
all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations from all Governmental Authorities or other third parties and
make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with all
Governmental Authorities or other third parties, including but not limited to
the Innovation Authority and the Investment Center that are necessary to
consummate the Offer and the Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, Parent shall have control over and lead all communications and
strategy relating to obtaining all such actions or non-actions, waivers,
consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and
filings.

(c) For purposes of _Section 4.6(a)_, " _commercially reasonable
best efforts_ " shall include (I) contesting and resisting any Legal
Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
Governmental Order that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
applicable Law; and (II) the obligation by Parent, Merger Sub, and any of
their Subsidiaries

 



47  to offer and consent to, and thereafter to implement, any of the following
measures if doing so would enable the parties to avoid, resolve, or lift a
Governmental Order or Legal Proceeding or to obtain any Governmental
Approval: (i) make any payment to any Governmental Authority as required by
applicable Law or the terms of any governmental grant, authorization or
permit, (ii) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or
otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of business of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, (iii) conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise
change the assets, business or portion of business of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in any manner, or (iv) impose any restriction, requirement or
limitation on the operation of the business or portion of the business of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall take or cause to
be taken any action that it is aware or reasonably should be aware would have
the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any Governmental
Approvals.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
obligations of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the Financing will be governed
exclusively by _Section 4.15_ and not this _Section 4.6_.

 

Section 4.7 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press release
to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Except as permitted in
accordance with _Section 4.5_, Parent and the Company shall thereafter
consult with each other before issuing, and, to the extent practicable, give
each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the Merger and consider in
good faith the views of the other party, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange or
trading market on which securities of Parent or the Company are listed, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use
reasonable best efforts to allow the other party or parties hereto reasonable
time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance
(it being understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or announcement, shall
be at the final discretion of the disclosing party). 

Section 4.8 _Director and Officer Liability_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall: (i)
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, against any costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses,

suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present
directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (in all of
their capacities) to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have
the right to advancement of expenses as of the Agreement Date by the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to the Company Charter Documents,
other charter and organizational documents of the Companys Subsidiaries and
the indemnification agreements in existence on the date hereof with

 



48  any directors and officers of the Company and any of the Company
Subsidiaries; and (ii) include and cause to be maintained in effect in the
Surviving Corporations (or any successors) charter and bylaws for a period
of six (6) years after the Closing, the current provisions regarding
elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors
and employees and advancement of expenses contained in the Company Charter
Documents.

(b) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporations or entity and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger; or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,
then and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 4.8_. 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a six (6) year
"tail" prepaid policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
indemnified parties, or any other person entitled to the benefit of this
_Section 4.8_, as applicable, than the existing directors and officers
liability (and fiduciary) insurance maintained by the Company, covering,
without limitation, the Merger and Merger Sub and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain such "tail" prepaid policy in full force and
effect for six (6) years after the Closing; _provided, however_ that (y) in
no event shall the Company or the Surviving Corporation be required or
permitted to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an aggregate
amount in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior
to the date hereof in respect of such coverage, and (z) if the aggregate
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount and the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall obtain a policy in accordance with
this sentence, such policy shall provide the greatest coverage available,
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

 

(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to assume, honor and fulfill
all obligations of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to
any written indemnification agreements with the indemnified parties, or any
other person entitled to the benefit of this _Section 4.8_, as applicable.

 

Section 4.9 _Director Resignations_. The Company shall provide Parent with a
correct and complete list of the directors and officers of the Company and
each of the Company Subsidiaries at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing. The Company shall, at the direction of Parent, obtain and deliver to

resignation, effective as of the Effective Time, of those directors of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company designated by Parent to the Company
in writing at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing.

 

Section 4.10 _Notification of Certain Events_. Each of the Company and Parent
shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, notify the other:

(a) upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it in this
Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any
failure of such Person to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such 

 



49  notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warrant of such party set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of
the other party to consummate the Merger, or the remedies available to the
parties hereto, and _provided further_ , that failure to give any such notice
shall not be treated as a breach of covenant for the purposes of _Section
6.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 6.1(d)_ of this Agreement, as applicable;

(b) to the extent the Company has Knowledge of such notice or communication or
the Parent has Knowledge of such notice or communication, as the case may be,

(c) of any material written communication from any Governmental Authority
related to the Merger; and

 

(d) of any proceedings commenced and served upon it or any Company

the Agreement Date, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant
to any Section of this Agreement.

material action in respect of (A) any Transaction Litigation, (B) any other
material civil litigation, investigation, arbitration, proceeding or claim
involving or against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries set forth
in  _Section 4.11_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules, or (C) any
litigation, investigation, arbitration, proceeding or other claim involving or
against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries brought by a
Governmental Authority or otherwise involving regulatory action or involving
criminal charges or allegations or consent or commit to the taking of any of
the foregoing actions, unless in each case Parent shall have consented in
advance and in writing and (ii) after receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, shall, if requested by Parent, use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to settle any unresolved Transaction Litigation in accordance with
Parents direction.

 

Section 4.12 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Date, the Company shall take
all such steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by
_Article I_ , and any other dispositions of equity securities (including
derivative securities) of the Company by each individual who is or will be
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

Section 4.13 _Employee Matters_.

(a) For purposes of this _Section 4.13_, (i) the term " _Covered Employees_ "
means employees who are actively employed by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary at the Effective Time; and (ii) the term " _Continuation Period_ "
means the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time.

 



50 (b) During the Continuation Period, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or any Company Subsidiary to, provide to the Covered Employees
for so long as such Covered Employees remain employees of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary during the Continuation
Period, compensation (such term to include salary, annual cash bonus
opportunities, commissions and severance) and benefits (including the costs
thereof to Company Employee Benefit Plan participants) that are in the
aggregate, no less favorable than the compensation (excluding any equity
or equity-based compensation, retention, change of control, transaction or
similar bonuses, and nonqualified deferred compensation) and benefits
(excluding, any defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical benefits)
being provided to Covered Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except as contemplated prior to the date hereof pursuant to a restructuring
plan or otherwise.

 

(c) During the Continuation Period, Parent shall maintain or cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to maintain employee
benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements for Covered Employees that
are substantially similar in the aggregate to the Company Employee Benefit
Plans (other than long-term incentives, change in control, retention,
transition, stay or similar arrangements) that were in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except as contemplated prior to the date hereof
pursuant to a restructuring plan or otherwise.

 

(d) In the event any Covered Employee first becomes eligible to participate
under any employee benefit plan, program, policy, or arrangement of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries (" _Parent
Employee Benefit Plan_ ") following the Effective Time, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to use commercially reasonable efforts to, for Covered Employees who become
eligible during the calendar year including the Effective Time: (i) waive any
preexisting condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to any Covered Employee
under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, or vision
benefits to the same extent such limitation would have been waived or
satisfied under the Company Employee Benefit Plan the Covered Employee
participated in immediately prior to coverage under the Parent Employee
Benefit Plan; and (ii) provide each Covered Employee with credit for any
copayments and deductibles paid prior to the Covered Employees coverage
under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan during the calendar year in which such
amount was paid, to the same extent such credit was given under the employee
benefit plan Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage
under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan, in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the Parent Employee Benefit
Plan.

 

(e) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall recognize, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries to recognize, all
service of each Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time, to the Company
(or any predecessor entities of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries) for vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for benefit
accrual purposes, except for vacation and severance, as applicable) to the
same extent as such Covered Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time,
to credit for such service under any similar Company Plan in which such
Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. In no
event shall anything contained in this _Section 4.13(e)_ result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

 



51 (f) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, as of the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to, honor in accordance with their terms and, in each case, subject to
_Section 4.13(h)_, all employment, change in control, severance and other
compensation plans and agreements existing immediately prior to the execution
of this Agreement, which are between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and
any director, officer or employee thereof or maintained by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (each, a " _Company Agreement_ "). Parent and the Company
hereby agree that the occurrence of the Effective Time shall constitute a
"Change in Control" for purposes of all Company Agreements and all Company
Benefit Plans in which the term is relevant. 

(g) To the extent the Company has failed to properly file any Form 5500 Annual
Return/Report with respect to any Company Employee Benefit Plan (including
any terminated plan), the Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all
necessary and appropriate corrective action through the Department of Labors
Delinquent Filer Voluntary Correction Program to correct such failure. 

(h) Nothing in this _Section 4.13_ shall (i) be construed to create any
third-party beneficiary rights; (ii) be construed to limit the right of
Parent, the Company, or any of the Company Subsidiaries (including, following
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) to amend or terminate any
Company Plan or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or
termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, or (iii) be
construed to require Parent, the Company, or any of the Company Subsidiaries
(including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) to
retain the employment of any particular Person for any fixed period of time
following the Effective Time.

Section 4.14  _Confidentiality_. The parties hereto acknowledge that Siris
Capital Group, LLC and the Company have previously executed a confidentiality
agreement, dated as of October 3, 2013 (as amended, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms, except as
expressly modified herein. The Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically
terminate at the Effective Time without further action by any party thereto.

Section 4.15 _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of Merger Sub and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to consummate and obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the terms
and conditions (including the flex provisions) described in the Financing
Commitments (as replaced, amended, supplemented, modified, waived or
superseded to the extent not prohibited by _Section 4.15(b)_ below) on a
timely basis to facilitate the Closing when required by _Section 1.2_,
including using their respective reasonable best efforts to: (i) to maintain
in effect the Financing Commitments until the Transactions are consummated,
(ii) enforce (including through specific performance, litigation or other
appropriate proceedings, each of the foregoing pursued in good faith) its
rights under the Debt Commitment Papers, (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
(including flex provisions) contained in the Financing Commitments (or on
terms not materially less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub than the terms and
conditions (including flex provisions) in the Financing Commitments), (iv)
satisfy, or cause their Representatives to satisfy, on or prior to the Closing
Date (or obtain the waiver of) all

 



52  conditions in the Financing Commitments and such definitive agreements
applicable to it that are within its control and (v) cause (including through
litigation pursued in good faith) the Financing Sources who are party to the
Debt Financing Commitments and any other person providing Financing to fund
the Financing at the Closing (and in any event prior to the Outside Date).

 

(b) Neither Merger Sub nor Parent shall agree to any amendments or
modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other
provision or remedy under the Financing Commitments or Financing Agreements
without the prior written consent of the Company (which may be granted or
withheld in the Companys sole discretion), to the extent such amendments,
modifications or waivers would or would reasonably be expected to (i) reduce
(or have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of aggregate cash
proceeds available from the Financing (including by changing the amount of
fees to be paid or original issue discount) below an amount that, when
combined with Parents and Merger Subs other sources of funds, is sufficient
to fund the Required Amount, or (ii) impose new or additional conditions
precedent to the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions precedent to the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to be adverse to Merger Sub, Parent or the Company, including any
expansion, amendment or modification that would or would be reasonably
be expected to (A) prevent or delay or impair the ability of Merger Sub and
Parent to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions to be consummated
on the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement, (B) adversely impact the
ability of Merger Sub or Parent to enforce its rights or remedies against the
other parties to the Financing Commitments or Financing Agreements or (C) make
the funding of the Financing on the Closing Date or satisfaction of the
conditions precedent to obtaining the Financing on the Closing Date any less
likely to occur; _provided_ that, subject to compliance with the other
provisions of this _Section 4.15_, Parent and Merger Sub may amend the Debt
Commitment Letter to (1) add and/or replace arrangers, bookrunners, agents or
similar entities, (2) modify pricing or implement or exercise any of the flex
provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Papers and (3) reallocate
commitments or assign or reassign titles or roles to, or between or among,
any parties to the Debt Commitment Papers in accordance with the terms
thereof. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such
amendment, modification or waiver of any of the Financing Commitments or the
Financing Agreements. Neither Merger Sub nor Parent shall release or consent
to the termination of the obligations of the lenders and other Persons under
the Financing Commitments or Financing Agreements, except for (i) replacements
of the Debt Commitment Letter with alternative financing commitments pursuant
to _Section 4.15(d)_, or (ii) assignments and replacements of lenders under
the terms of the syndication of the Financing Commitments in accordance with
the terms thereof so long as any such assignment or replacement would not
result in any of the circumstances described in the first sentence of this
_Section 4.15(b)_.

 

(c) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes or would reasonably
be expected to become unavailable in the manner contemplated in the Financing
Commitments (other than as a result of the termination of the Financing
Commitments on the Outside Date pursuant to the terms thereof), Parent shall
promptly so notify the Company. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any
event within two (2) Business Days of the date the Company delivers to Parent
or Merger Sub a written request, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance
referred to in the immediately preceding sentence or in _Section
4.15(d)(ii)_; _provided, however_ , subject to the rules of discovery
otherwise applicable, that Parent or Merger Sub need not

 



53  provide any information that it believes after consultation with external
legal counsel to be privileged. Upon the occurrence of any circumstance
referred to in the second preceding sentence or in _Section 4.15(d)(ii)_,
Merger Sub and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain in replacement thereof, and to negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from the same or
alternative financial institutions or other Persons (which such alternative
financing (x) shall be in an amount, when combined with Merger Subs and
Parents other source of funds, equal to the Required Amount on terms and
conditions that are not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Merger
Sub and Parent than those in the Financing Commitments (including flex
provisions) as in effect on the date hereof and (y) shall not contain any
terms that would not be permitted to be effected by an amendment,
modification or waiver of the Financing Commitments pursuant to _Section
4.15(b)_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no
event shall the "reasonable best efforts" of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed
or be construed to require Parent or Merger Sub to, and neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall be required to (i) seek equity financing from any source
other than those counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that
contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter, (ii) pay any fees in the
aggregate in excess of those contemplated by the Financing Commitments as in
effect on the date hereof (including any flex provisions contained therein)
or (iii) agree to conditionality or economic terms of any Financing that are
less favorable than those contemplated by the Financing Commitments as in
effect on the date hereof (including any flex provisions contained therein).
The definitive agreements entered into pursuant to the first sentence of this
_Section 4.15(c)_ or _Section 4.15(a)(iii)_ are referred to in this
Agreement, collectively, as the " _Financing Agreements_." In the event any
new Financing Commitment is obtained as permitted or required in accordance
herewith, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing," the "Equity
Financing" or the "Debt Financing" means the financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitment(s) as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced
pursuant to this _Section 4.15_ and the "Debt Commitment Papers" means the
Debt Commitment Papers as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced
pursuant to this _Section 4.15_, and (B) any reference in this Agreement to
the "Financing Agreements" or the "Financing Commitments" shall be deemed to
include the Financing Commitment(s) that are not superseded in accordance
herewith by a new Financing Commitment at the time in question and the new
Financing Commitment(s) to the extent then in effect. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges
and agrees that neither the obtaining of the Financing (or any alternative
Financing), the performance by any party to any Financing Commitment of its
obligations thereunder nor the completion of any issuance of securities
contemplated by the Financing (or any alternative Financing) is a condition
to Closing and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the
availability of the Financing or any alternative Financing, or the completion
of any such issuance, subject to the applicable conditions set forth in
_Section 5.1_ and _Section 5.2_.

 

(d) Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies

letters, to the extent required by the terms of the applicable Debt Commitment
Letter, redacted in a manner consistent with the Redacted Fee Letter)
promptly upon their execution, but in any event on the same day as the
execution thereof, (ii) without limiting the generality of the immediately
following subclause (iii), give the Company written notice as soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event within

 



54  two (2) Business Days, of (A) any breach or threatened breach of which
either Merger Sub or Parent is or becomes aware by any party of any of the
Financing Commitments, any alternative financing commitment, the Financing
Agreements, or any alternative financing agreement entered into in accordance
with this _Section 4.15_ or any termination or attempted or threatened
termination thereof (in each case, whether or not such attempted or
threatened termination is valid), (B) if Parent or Merger Sub obtains
Knowledge that any of the Financing Commitments ceases to be in full force and
effect and the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent
or Merger Sub or of the other parties thereto, (C) if Parent or Merger Sub or
any of their respective Representatives receives (1) any written notice or (2)
other written communication, in each case from any Financing Source with
respect to (y) any actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any of the Debt Commitment Papers or Financing
Agreements of any provisions of the Financing Commitments or Financing
Agreements or (z) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to any of the Financing Commitments or Financing Agreements with
respect to the obligation to fund the Financing in an amount equal to the
Required Amount at Closing on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Financing Commitments or (D) if Parent or Merger Sub receives (1) any written
notice or (2) other written communication on the basis of which Parent or
Merger Sub believes in good faith that it is reasonably likely that a party
to the Financing Commitments will fail to fund the Financing Commitments or
reduce the amount of the Financing Commitments and, as a result thereof, the
aggregate cash amount of funding commitments thereunder (after giving effect
to any corresponding increases), when combined with Parents and Merger Subs
other sources of funds, would be less than the Required Amount (in each case
of the foregoing subclauses (A)-(D), _provided, however_ , subject to the
rules of discovery otherwise applicable, that Parent or Merger Sub need not
provide any information that is privileged or that is requested for purposes
of litigation), and (iii) otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Financing (or any alternative financing under this
_Section 4.15_).

file with the ITA in full coordination with Parent, an application for a
ruling (which shall be approved by Parent prior to its submission) confirming
that (i) the payment of the Merger Consideration to holders of Company 102
Awards and disposition of the Company 102 Shares in accordance with _Section
1.8_ shall not be regarded as a violation of the "requisite holding
period" (as such term is defined in Section 102 of the ITO) so long as the
respective Merger Consideration is deposited with the 102 Trustee until the
end of the respective holding period and (ii) the deposit of the respective
Merger Consideration with the Payment Agent and the 102 Trustee shall not be
subject to any withholding obligation (which ruling may be subject to

Tax Ruling_ "). The Company or applicable Company Subsidiary shall include in
the request for the Option Tax Ruling a request to exempt Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Payment Agent and their respective agents from any
withholding obligation. If the Option Tax Ruling is not granted prior to the

applicable Company Subsidiary shall seek to obtain prior to the Closing an
interim tax ruling confirming, among other things, that Parent and any Person
acting on its behalf (including the Payment Agent) shall be exempt from
Israeli withholding Tax in relation to any payments made with respect to any
Company Equity Awards and Company Shares (whether or not subject to Section
102 of the ITO) to the Payment Agent or the 102 Trustee in connection with
the Merger (the " _Interim Option Tax Ruling_ "). To the extent that prior to
the Closing an Interim Option Tax Ruling shall have been obtained, then all
references herein to the Option Tax Ruling shall be deemed to refer to such
Interim Option Tax Ruling, until such time that a final definitive Option Tax
Ruling is obtained.

 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall cause their respective Israeli
counsel, advisors and accountants to coordinate all activities, and
to cooperate with each other, with respect to the preparation and filing of
such application and in the preparation of any written or oral submissions
that may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Option Tax Ruling
(including the Interim Option Tax Ruling). The final text of the Interim
Option Tax Ruling and the Option Tax Ruling shall be subject to the prior
written consent of Parent or its counsel, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
obtain the Interim Option Tax Ruling or the Option Tax Ruling as promptly as
practicable. Should Parents counsel not attend any meeting with the ITA, the
Company shall provide Parent with an update of such meeting or discussion
within two Business Days of such meeting or discussion.

 



60 (c) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement but in no
event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, the Company
shall instruct its Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants, in coordination
with Parent, to prepare and file with the ITA an application for a ruling that

(as defined in the ITO or as will be determined by the ITA), (A) exempting
Parent and its respective agents from any obligation to withhold Israeli Tax
from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, or clarifying that no such
obligation exists, or (B) clearly instructing Parent and its respective agents
on how such withholding is to be executed, and in particular, with respect to
the classes or categories of holders of the Company Shares from which Tax is
to be withheld (if any), the rate or rates of withholding to be applied and
how to identify any such nonIsraeli residents; and (ii) with respect to
holders of Company Shares that are Israeli residents (as defined in the ITO or
as will be determined by the ITA) (other than Company Shares subject to
Section 102 of the ITO) (x) exempting Parent and its respective agents from
any obligation to withhold Israeli Tax from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, including the Merger
Consideration, or clarifying that no such obligation exists, or (y)
clearly instructing Parent and its respective agents on how such withholding
is to be executed, and in particular, with respect to the classes or
categories of holders of the Company Shares from which Tax is to be withheld
(if any), the rate or rates of withholding to be applied (the " _Withholding
Tax Ruling_ ").

Section 4.21 _Takeover Statutes and Rights Agreement_. The Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall not take any action that would cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements
imposed by any takeover statute. If any "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority," "affiliate transactions"
or "business combination statute or regulation" or other similar state anti-
takeover Laws and regulations may become, or may purport to be, applicable to
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company
and Parent shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall not (i) except as provided
in  _Section 2.23_ , terminate (or permit the termination of), waive or amend
the Rights Agreement, (ii) redeem any rights under the Rights Agreement or
(iii) take any action with respect to, or make any determination under, the

warranty contained in this Agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or
the Parent or Merger Sub has failed to perform or comply with any of its
respective covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach,
inaccuracy or failure to perform or comply would (1) give rise to the failure
of a condition set forth in _Section 5.2_ and (2) is incapable of being cured
prior to the Outside Date or, if curable, is not cured by the Parent or
Merger Sub on or before the earlier of (A) the Outside Date or (B) the date
that is thirty (30) calendar days following the receipt by the Parent of
written notice from Company of such breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform
or comply; _provided_ that Company is not then in breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
such that it would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in 
_Section 5.3(a)_ or _Section 5.3(b)_; or

(ii) (A) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 5.1_ and _Section 5.3_
have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which is capable of being
satisfied at the Closing or unless the failure to be so satisfied is due to
any material breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or the failure of Parent
or Merger Sub to perform or comply with any of its respective material
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement) or, to the extent
permitted by Law, waived, (B) Parent shall have failed to consummate the
Merger by the time the Closing was required to occur under _Section 1.2_; (C)
the Company has irrevocably notified Parent in writing that it stands ready,
willing and able to consummate the Merger; _provided_ that it need not stand
ready to close over any material violation of Law or Governmental Order
arising out of any material breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or
any failure of the Parent or Merger Sub to perform or comply with any of its
respective material covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; (D)
the Company shall have given Parent written notice at least three (3) Business
Days prior to such termination stating the Companys intention to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 6.1(d)(ii)_ and (E) the Merger
shall not have been consummated by the end of such three (3) Business Day
period; or

 

(iii) at any time prior to receiving the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company Board authorizes the Company to enter into a definitive Company
Acquisition Agreement providing for a Superior Proposal and to, concurrently
with such termination, enter into such Company Acquisition Agreement;
_provided_ , that, as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of any such
termination (A) the Company shall have paid the Company Termination Fee in
accordance with the terms, and at the times, specified in _Section 6.3(b)_
and (B) the Company concurrently shall have entered into such Company
Acquisition Agreement.

Section 6.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in  _Section 6.1_, this Agreement shall be of no
further force or effect; _provided_ ,

 



64   _however_ , that _Section 4.5(f)_, _Section 4.16(d)_, _Section 4.19_,
this _Section 6.2_, _Section 6.3_ and _Article VII_ (and
the Confidentiality Agreement and the Guarantee) shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect.

 

Section 6.3 _Expenses; Termination Fees_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be borne by the
party incurring such cost or expense.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to 
_Section 6.1(c)(i)_ or by the Company pursuant to _Section 6.1(d)(iii)_,
then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee. The Company
Termination Fee payable pursuant to this _Section 6.3(b)_ shall be paid no
later than the second (2nd) Business Day following termination pursuant to
_Section 6.1(c)(i)_ and concurrently (or the next Business Day if payment is
not feasible on the date of termination) with any termination pursuant to 
_Section 6.1(d)(iii)_.

(c) If (i) after the date of this Agreement but prior to the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, an Acquisition Proposal shall
have become publicly known and not withdrawn, (ii) thereafter, this Agreement
is terminated (A) by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)(i)_
or  _Section 6.1(b)(iii)_ (unless the Company would have been entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1(d)(i)_ or _Section
6.1(d)(ii)_ but for such termination pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)(i)_ or
_Section 6.1(b)(iii)_) or (B) by Parent pursuant to _Section 6.1(c)(ii)_
(unless the Company Termination Fee provided in _Section 6.3(b)_ has already
been paid pursuant to the terms thereof), and (iii) within nine (9) months
after such termination, the Company enters into a definitive written agreement
for, or consummates, any Acquisition Transaction which, for the avoidance of
doubt, need not be with the party to such Acquisition Proposal referenced in
_Section 6.3(c)(i)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company
Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds on the earlier of the date
such definitive written agreement is signed or the consummation of such
Acquisition Transaction; _provided_ that solely for purposes of this _Section
6.3(c)_, all references to 20% in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction"
shall be deemed to be references to 50%.

 

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 6.1(d)(i)_ or _Section 6.1(d)(ii)_, then Parent shall pay to the
Company the Parent Termination Fee. The Parent Termination Fee payable
pursuant to this _Section 6.3(d)_ shall be paid no later than the second
(2nd) Business Day following termination pursuant to  _Section 6.1(d)(i)_ or
_Section 6.1(d)(ii)_ (it being understood that in no event shall the Parent
Termination Fee be payable on more than one occasion).

 

(e) All payments under this _Section 6.3_ shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the party
to whom payment is owed.

(f) Subject to _Section 7.6_ and notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges
and agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that its receipt of the
Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 6.3(b)_  

 



65  or _Section 6.3(c)_, shall, except in the case of fraud or willful or
intentional breach, constitute the sole and exclusive remedy under this
Agreement of Parent, Merger Sub and each of their Affiliates and
Representatives, and the receipt of the Company Termination Fee shall be
deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, each of their Affiliates and
Representatives and any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and
the termination hereof), the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby (and the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter forming the
basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, their respective
Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person shall be entitled to bring
or maintain any Legal Proceeding against the Company or its Affiliates arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination
thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such termination.

 

(g) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this _Section 6.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither
the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the fee due
pursuant to _Section 6.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or
the Company commences litigation that results in an award against the other
party for such fee, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall pay to
the other party its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such litigation, together with interest on
the amount of the applicable fee from the date such payment was required to be
made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in _The
Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company agrees and acknowledges that, except as expressly permitted by
_Section 7.6_, if Parent and Merger Sub fail to effect the Merger or
otherwise are in breach of this Agreement, then (i) the Companys sole and
exclusive remedy against Parent, Merger Sub, any debt or equity financing
source, any Guarantor, or any of their respective Affiliates and any of their
respective former, current and future direct or indirect equity holders,
controlling persons, stockholders, agents, Affiliates, members, managers,
general or limited partners, assignees or Representatives (collectively, the
" _Parent Related Parties_ "), whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise, shall be to terminate this Agreement in accordance with 
_Section 6.1(d)(i)_ or _Section 6.1(d)(ii)_ and to collect, if due, the
Parent Termination Fee and any other amounts payable pursuant to _Section
4.16_, _Section 4.19_ and _Section 6.3(g)_ or under the Guarantee, (ii) the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee shall be deemed liquidated damages for
any and all direct or indirect losses or damages of any kind, character or
description incurred or suffered by the Company or any other Person in
connection with this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and (iii) no other Parent
Related Party shall have any further liability or obligation whatsoever
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (except
that Siris Capital Group, LLC shall also be obligated with respect to the
Confidentiality Agreement, Parent shall also be obligated with respect to the
expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section
4.16_ and _Section 4.19_, and the Guarantors shall also be obligated pursuant
to the terms and conditions of the Guarantee (collectively, the " _Additional
Amounts_ ")). For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances

 



66  shall the Company be (x) entitled to collect the Parent Termination Fee on
more than one occasion (or, after the receipt thereof, any portion thereof or
any further funds or amounts) or (y) permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance as contemplated by _Section 7.6_ and any money
damages, including all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee. The
Company further agrees that in the event of termination the maximum aggregate
liability of Parent, Merger Sub and all of the other Parent Related Parties,
taken as a whole, shall be limited to an amount equal to the amount of the
Parent Termination Fee, and in no event shall the Company seek to recover, or
be entitled to recover, any money damages or other losses or damages of any
kind, character or description in excess of such amount, except that such
limitation of liability shall in no event or circumstance apply to
any Additional Amounts that may be due or payable by any Parent Related Party
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (including for such purposes the
Guarantee or the Confidentiality Agreement). In no event shall the Company
seek to recover, or be entitled to recover, monetary damages from any Parent
Related Party, other than Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement or the
Guarantors under the Guarantee. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that
it shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, institute any
proceeding or bring any other claim arising under, or in connection with, this
Agreement, the Financing Commitments, the Guarantee or the negotiation,
execution, performance, abandonment or termination of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (whether at law or in equity, under any theory
of liability (including without limitation by attempting to pierce a
corporate, limited liability company or partnership veil)) against Parent or
any Parent Related Party except for claims: (i) against Parent and/or Merger
Sub in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; (ii)
against Parent and/or Merger Sub for indemnification or expense reimbursement
under  _Section 4.16_ and _Section 4.19_, (iii) against the Guarantors
under the Guarantee, subject to the terms and limitations thereof; (iv)
against the parties to the Equity Commitment Letter for specific performance
of their respective obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter, subject
to the terms and limitations thereof if, and only if, the conditions of
_Section 7.6(a)_ (in case of the foregoing, other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied (or
waived); and (v) against Siris Capital Group, LLC under the Confidentiality
Agreement, subject to the terms and limitations thereof (the claims described
in clauses (i) through (v) collectively, the " _Retained Claims_ ").
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company (on behalf of
itself and each of its current and future direct or indirect equity holders,
controlling persons, stockholders, agents, Affiliates, members, managers,
general or limited partners, assignees and Representatives) hereby waives any
rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source or any of its Affiliates
and any of their respective former, current and future direct or indirect
equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, agents, Affiliates,
members, managers, general or limited partners, assignees or Representatives
(collectively, including the Financing Sources, the " _Debt Financing Source
Related Parties_ ") in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or
the Debt Commitment Letters, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and the Company (on behalf of itself and each of its current and
future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders,
agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, assignees
and Representatives) agrees not to commence (and if commenced, agrees to
dismiss or otherwise terminate) any dispute, suit, claim, litigation,
investigation, proceeding or other action against any Debt Financing Source
Related Party in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
Debt Commitment Letters. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing waiver, it is

 



67  agreed that no Debt Financing Source Related Party shall have any liability
for any claims, losses, settlements, damages, costs, expenses, fines or
penalties to the Company (or any of its current and future direct or indirect
equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, agents, Affiliates,
members, managers, general or limited partners, assignees and Representatives)
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.3(h)_ shall in any
way limit or modify the rights and obligations of Parent or Merger Sub (nor,
following the Closing Date, the Company as the Surviving Corporation)
under the Debt Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements.

inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto;

hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party.

Merger shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the
State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of
Law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of another
jurisdiction.

 

(b) SUBJECT TO Section 7.12, ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY MAY BE INSTITUTED SOLELY AND
EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OR THE
COURTS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, IN EACH CASE LOCATED IN THE STATE OF
DELAWARE, AND EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF
PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICE OR OTHER DOCUMENT BY MAIL TO SUCH PARTYS ADDRESS SET
FORTH HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION OR
OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION
OR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD

SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS Section 7.5(c).

 

Section 7.6 _Specific Enforcement_.

 

(a) Subject to the remainder of this _Section 7.6_, the parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages would not be an
adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are
not performed in accordance with the terms hereof or are otherwise breached,
and, at the non-breaching partys election, such non-breaching party shall be
entitled to specific performance and the issuance of injunctive and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the courts
chosen in  _Section 7.5(b)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that the right of the Company to
obtain an injunction, or other appropriate form of specific performance or
equitable relief, in each case, solely with respect to causing Parent and
Merger Sub to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this
Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter) shall be subject to the
requirements that:

 

(i) with respect to any funding of the Equity Financing to occur at the
Closing, all the conditions set forth in _Section 5.1_ and  _Section 5.3_
would have been satisfied if the Closing were to have occurred at such time
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of
being satisfied at the Closing);

(ii) the Debt Financing (or, in the case alternative debt financing has been
obtained in accordance with  _Section 4.15(c)_ for all the Debt Financing,
such alternative debt financing) has been funded or would be funded in
accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing, if the Equity Financing is
funded at the Closing;

 

(iii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing in accordance with
_Section 1.2_, and

 



70 (iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that (A) all
conditions in  _Section 5.1_ and _Section 5.2_ have been satisfied or that
it is willing to waive any such open conditions, and (B) if specific
performance is granted and if the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing were
funded, the Closing would occur.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) in no event shall the exercise of the
Companys right to seek specific performance or other equitable relief
pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ reduce, restrict or otherwise limit the
Companys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof and be paid the Parent Termination Fee (provided, that under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance that results in the Merger occurring pursuant to
this _Section 7.6_ and the payment of all or any portion of the Parent
Termination Fee) plus any Additional Amounts and (ii) the Companys right to
seek specific performance pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ shall include the
right of the Company to cause Parent and/or Merger Sub to fully enforce the
terms of the Debt Financing Papers, including by requiring Parent and/or
Merger Sub to file one or more lawsuits against any party to the Debt
Financing Papers to fully enforce the obligations of such party therein.
Subject to  _Section 7.6(a)_, each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that (x) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or
(y) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity.

Section 7.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise),
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to
make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except
that Parent and Merger Sub may assign, in their sole discretion, any or all of
its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any one or
more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent, effective with
the Effective Date, or as collateral to the applicable Debt Financing Sources
in connection with the Debt Financing without the consent of the Company, but
no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of their
respective obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

Section 7.8 _Notices_. All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands,
waivers and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be
deemed to have been given (a) when delivered by hand (with written
confirmation of receipt); (b) when received by the addressee if sent by a

Section 7.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of
this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto
agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit
such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace
such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable
and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties shall negotiate in good
faith to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision.
