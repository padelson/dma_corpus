Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or any
holder of any shares of Company Common Stock:

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of the common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute
the only shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation outstanding
immediately after the Effective Time. Each certificate evidencing ownership of
such shares of common stock of Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Cancellation
of Earnout Shares_.

(i) Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock that is directly
owned by the Company, Parent or any of their direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid in
exchange therefor.

 



3 (ii) Each Earnout Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Escrow Agreement and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be paid in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (A) shares of Company Common Stock to
be canceled in accordance with  _Section 2.1(b)_ and (B) any Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $12.00 in cash, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(ii) At the Effective Time, all issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of (x) a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.1(c)_ (a " _Certificate_ ") or (y)
any shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.1(c)_ that are represented
by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Section 2.1(c)_, in each case
without any interest thereon, in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with  _Section 2.2(b)_, in the case of
certificated shares, and automatically, in the case of Book-Entry Shares.

(iii) In the event that, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, there is a change in the number of shares of Company Common Stock or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as a result of a reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or
other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect such action.

 

(iv) The right of any holder of Company Common Stock to receive Merger
Consideration shall, to the extent provided in  _Section 2.2(h)_, be subject
to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under
applicable Tax Law.

(d) _Treatment of Company Warrants_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all such actions as may be required to cause each
outstanding Company Warrant to be canceled, effective as of the Effective
Time, and converted into a right to receive an amount of cash (rounded to the
nearest cent), without interest, equal to the product of (x) the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share
of each such Company Warrant, _multiplied_ _by_ (y) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that may be purchased pursuant to such Company Warrant
(the " _Warrant Consideration_ ").

 



4 (e) _Treatment of Stock Options_.

 

(i) Effective as of the Effective Time, each outstanding Earnout Option shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be paid in exchange therefor. The Company shall take all such actions as
may be required to effect the cancellation of the Earnout Options as set forth
in the immediately preceding sentence, including using reasonable best
efforts to obtain written confirmation of such cancellation from each holder
of each such Earnout Option (it being hereby understood that the obtaining of
such confirmations shall not be deemed to constitute a condition to
the Closing).

(ii) Effective as of the Effective Time, (A) each outstanding Non-Earnout
Option that is vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time (each, a "
_Vested Non-Earnout Option_ ") shall be canceled and converted into a right to
receive the Non-Earnout Option Consideration, which shall be paid to the
holder of each such Vested Non-Earnout Option, net of all applicable
withholdings, within ten (10) Business Days following the Closing Date, and
(B) each outstanding Non-Earnout Option that is unvested as of the Effective
Time (each, an " _Unvested Non-Earnout Option_ ") shall be canceled and
converted into a right to receive the Non-Earnout Option Consideration, which
shall be payable to the holder of each such Unvested Non-Earnout Option, net
of all applicable withholdings, on the earliest of (1) December 31, 2012, (2)
the last payroll date of Parent in the 2012 calendar year and (3) the payroll
date of Parent next following the date on which such Non-Earnout Option would
have become vested (such date, the " _Unvested Non-Earnout Option Payment
Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if a holders employment with Parent
and its Subsidiaries is terminated prior to the Unvested Non-Earnout Option
Payment Date (I) without "Cause" (as defined in the HUGHES Telematics, Inc.
2009 Equity and Incentive Plan), (II) by the holder for "Good Reason" (as
defined in the HUGHES Telematics, Inc. 2009 Equity and Incentive Plan), (III)
by reason of the holders "Disability" (as defined in the HUGHES Telematics,
Inc. 2009 Equity and Incentive Plan) or (IV) by reason of the holders death,
then, in the case of any of clauses (I)(IV), the Unvested Non-Earnout
Option Consideration shall be payable to such holder promptly following such
termination of employment, subject, in the case of a termination pursuant to
clause (I) or (II) only, to the holders execution and non-revocation of a
release of claims in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, and if a
holders employment with Parent and its Subsidiaries is terminated prior the
Unvested Non-Earnout Option Payment Date for any reason other than as set
forth in clause (I), (II), (III) or (IV) of this _Section 2.1(e)(ii)_, then
such holder shall forfeit any right to the unpaid Non-Earnout Option
Consideration as of the date of such termination. With respect to each holder
of Non-Earnout Options, it shall be a condition to the receipt of any payment
pursuant to this _Section 2.1(e)(ii)_ by such holder that such holder shall
execute a written confirmation of the cancellation pursuant to _Section
2.1(e)(i)_ hereof of any Earnout Options that are held by such holder (it
being hereby understood that the obtaining of such confirmations shall not be
deemed to constitute a condition to the Closing).

 



5 (f) _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(i) Shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders who have not voted
in favor of or consented to the adoption of this Agreement and who are
entitled to demand and have properly demanded appraisal of the fair value of
such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be canceled and converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof shall
be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such stockholder of the Company shall
fail to perfect or shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such
stockholders rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholders
Dissenting Shares in respect of which the stockholder would otherwise be
entitled to receive payment under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into the right (if otherwise entitled
to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_) to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_ (payable without any
interest thereon).

 

(ii) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demand for
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and any written withdrawals of
such notices and any other instruments or notices delivered to the Company
prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. Parent shall
have the right to direct negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, and the Company shall have the
right to participate in such negotiations and proceedings. Prior to the
Effective Time, neither the Company nor Parent shall, except with the prior
written consent of the other party or as otherwise required by an Order, (x)
make any payment or other commitment with respect to any such exercise of
appraisal rights, (y) offer to settle or settle any such rights or (z)
waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely
take any other action to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates; Book-Entry Shares; Payment Procedures_.

(a) _Payments_.

(i) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a
payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Payment Agent_ ") and shall cause to be
deposited, with the Payment Agent for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, cash in an aggregate amount equal to the
sum of (x) the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration to be paid in respect
of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ and (y) the
aggregate amount of Warrant Consideration to be paid in respect of Company
Warrants pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_. All cash deposited with the Payment
Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.2(a)_ shall hereinafter be referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The Payment Agent shall deliver the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to  _Section 2.1(c)_ and the Warrant
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ out of the Exchange Fund.
Except to the extent set forth in _Section 2.2(f)_ or to make payments as
contemplated by the proviso in  _Section 2.1(f)_, the Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
fees and expenses owed to the Payment Agent.

 



6 (ii) _Option Payments_. Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause to be deposited with the Surviving Corporation sufficient funds to
make all payments pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)(ii)(A)_.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) _Letters of Transmittal_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event within five (5) Business Days after the
Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Payment Agent to mail:

 

(A) to each holder of record of one or more Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
(1) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company and shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent or, with respect to
Book-Entry Shares, in accordance with the instructions in the letter of
transmittal, and which shall be in customary form and contain customary
provisions) and (2) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_; and

(B) to each holder of Company Warrants that were converted into the right to
receive the Warrant Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_, (1) a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall be in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company) and (2) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of such Company Warrants in exchange for the Warrant Consideration
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.1(d)_.

(ii) _Certificates_. Each holder of record of one or more Certificates
shall, upon surrender to the Payment Agent of such Certificates, together
with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Payment Agent, be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Payment Agent to pay and
deliver in exchange therefor, as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, the amount of Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_, and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of a
Certificate that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment of Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the transfer or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(b)_, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on
any payment to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_.

 



7 (iii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, a holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record
of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time
be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Payment Agent to pay and
deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time the amount of
Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.1(c)_.

(iv) _Company Warrants_. Each holder of Company Warrants shall, upon surrender
to the Payment Agent of such Company Warrants, together with a duly executed
letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Payment Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent
shall cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor, as
promptly as practicable, the amount of Warrant Consideration to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_. At any time after the
Effective Time, each Company Warrant shall be deemed to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Warrant Consideration to be paid in
respect of such Company Warrant pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_. No interest
shall be paid or will accrue on any payment to holders of Company Warrants
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_.

 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates (or automatically, in
the case of Book-Entry Shares) in accordance with the terms of this _Article
II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving
Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions
with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared
but not paid or made by the Company on the shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time. At
the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall
be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration and exchanged as
provided in this _Article II_.

 

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Unless otherwise directed by the
Surviving Corporation, any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve (12) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon
demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for, and the Surviving Corporation shall, subject to
_Section 2.2(e)_, remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Article II_.

 



8 (e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Payment Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash or
other distributions from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to
such date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Payment Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be income of the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such
cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or
short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the
U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), or in
mutual funds investing in such assets, and that no such investment or loss
thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_. If for any reason (including
losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy
all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Payment Agent
hereunder, Parent shall promptly cause to be deposited cash into the Exchange
Fund in an amount equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to
fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Payment Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, in accordance with this _Article II_ , the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_.

 

(h) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, Sub and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to, or in respect of, any Person
such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
United States federal or state, local or foreign Tax Laws. To the extent
that such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(b) Each Employee Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401 or for
other tax-favored treatment under Subchapter B of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of
the Code are so qualified (collectively, the " _Qualified Plans_ "), and any
trusts intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under the Code are

(c) All contributions required to be made to any Employee Benefit Plan by
applicable Law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance

the Employee Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for benefits), and to
the knowledge of the Company, there are no facts that would reasonably be
expected to form the basis for any such Action. There is not now, nor do any

and no condition exists that would reasonably be expected to present a
material risk to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA
Affiliates of incurring any such liability.

 



24 (g) No non-exempt "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section
4975 of the Code and Section 406 of ERISA has occurred with respect to any

Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any
liability to a Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial

of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has
been involved in any transaction that could cause the Company, any of its

(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) to be subject to liability under
Section 4069 of ERISA.

(i) The Company and its Subsidiaries have no liability for life, health,

contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such
transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. No person is or will
be entitled to receive any additional payment (including any tax gross-up or

be more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point
of view than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) such Takeover Proposal is reasonably likely to be consummated
on the terms so proposed, taking into account all relevant
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal, including
any conditions to closing, and (iii) financing for such Takeover Proposal, to
the extent required, is then fully committed or, in the good-faith judgment of
the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with its financial
advisors, including at least one Qualified Financial Advisor, and legal
counsel), is reasonably likely to be timely consummated.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is
understood that, in taking any action pursuant to  _Section 5.2_, _Section
5.3_ or _Section 8.1(e)_ (in each case, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein), the Special Committee may consider any such
action and may make a recommendation to the Board of Directors of the
Company, which may act upon such recommendation.

Section 5.3 _Company Board Recommendation_.

(a) Subject to _Section 5.3(b)_, _Section 5.3(c)_ and _Section
5.3(f)_, neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee

Parent, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) adopt, approve,
recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable, or publicly propose to
adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable, the
adoption of any Takeover Proposal (it being understood that a "stop-look-and-
listen" communication made in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act with respect to any Takeover Proposal that is a tender offer
or exchange offer shall not be considered a breach of this clause (ii)) or
(iii) authorize, commit or agree to take any such actions (each such foregoing
action or failure to act in clauses (i) through (iii) being referred to herein
as an " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 



42 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, at any time prior to the date on which the Stockholder
Written Consent is executed and delivered to Parent in accordance with
_Section 6.1(a)_ (the " _Written Consent Date_ ") or the Stockholder Approval
Date, as applicable, the Board of Directors of the Company may, subject to
compliance with _Section 5.3(c)_, effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change:

(i) if the Board of Directors of the Company (A) receives a Takeover Proposal
that it determines to be a Superior Proposal, (B) concludes in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors, including at least one
Qualified Financial Advisor, and outside legal counsel) that the failure to
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the directors of the Company
to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law and (C) approves or
recommends such Superior Proposal; or

(ii) in response to a fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances
that affects the business, assets or operations of the Company that is unknown
to the Board of Directors of the Company at and prior to the execution of
this Agreement (such fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances,
an " _Intervening Event_ ," it being understood that in no event shall the
receipt, existence or terms of a Takeover Proposal constitute an Intervening
Event), if the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith
(to the extent applicable, after consultation with its financial advisors,
including at least one Qualified Financial Advisor, and outside
legal counsel) that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure of the
Board of Directors to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Board of Directors of the Company and any committee thereof shall not be
entitled to effect any Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to
_Section 5.3(b)_ unless, prior to making such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change: (i) the Company shall have notified Parent in writing
that it intends to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (a "
_Recommendation Change Notice_ "), which Recommendation Change Notice shall
describe in reasonable detail the reasons for such intended Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and (A) in the case of a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to _Section 5.3(b)(i)_ in connection with a Superior
Proposal, shall include a summary of the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal and a copy of the substantially final form of any
related agreements, or (B) in the case of a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to _Section 5.3(b)(ii)_ in connection with an Intervening
Event, shall specify in reasonable detail the facts underlying the
determination of the Board of Directors of the Company that an Intervening
Event has occurred, and (ii) following delivery by the Company to Parent of
such Recommendation Change Notice, (A) (1) if requested by Parent, the Company
shall have made its Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good
faith with Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement intended by Parent to cause such Superior
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or to eliminate the need
for the Board of Directors of the Company to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change as a result of such Intervening Event, as applicable,
during the period of three (3) Business Days immediately following delivery by
the Company to Parent of such Recommendation Change Notice (the "
_Recommendation Change Notice Period_ "); _provided_ , that, if Parent shall
have delivered to the Company during such Recommendation Change Notice Period
a written proposal capable of being accepted by the Company to alter the terms
or conditions of this Agreement (the " _Parent Proposal_ "), the Board of
Directors of the Company shall be entitled to analyze and review such Parent
Proposal for one (1) Business Day

 



43  immediately following receipt of such proposal (the " _Analysis Period_ ");
and _provided_ , _further_ , that, in the event that, (x) after delivery of a
Recommendation Change Notice in connection with a Superior Proposal, there
has been a material change or revision to the terms of such Superior Proposal
or (y) after delivery of a Recommendation Change Notice in connection with an
Intervening Event, there has been a material change in the facts, events or
circumstances relating to such Intervening Event, in the case of each of the
clauses (x) and (y), (i) the Company shall notify Parent of such material
change or revision within 24 hours following such change or revision, and
(ii) in connection with such material change or revision the then current
Recommendation Change Notice Period shall be extended such that at least two
(2) Business Days remains in such Recommendation Change Notice Period
subsequent to the time the Company so notifies Parent of any such material
change or revision, and (2) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors,
including at least one Qualified Financial Advisor, and outside legal
counsel), after considering the terms of such Parent Proposal, that (x) such
third-party Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal
if the modifications proposed by Parent were given effect or (y) that a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would continue to be required as a
result of such Intervening Event, as applicable, or (B) Parent shall have
notified the Company that it has elected not to negotiate with the Company
with respect to any modifications to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and/or not to deliver to the Company a Parent Proposal. The Company
shall keep confidential any proposals made by Parent to revise the terms of
this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be
entitled to enter into any Contract (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to a Superior Proposal unless this
Agreement has been or is concurrently terminated by its terms pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ and, if required pursuant to _Section 8.3_, the Company has
paid, or substantially concurrently pays, to Parent the Company Termination
Fee.

(d) Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, (i) the
obligations of the Company pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)_ to call, give notice
of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and to hold a vote of
the Companys stockholders on the adoption of this Agreement at the Company
Stockholders Meeting, to the extent the Stockholder Written Consent is not
delivered in accordance with _Section 6.1(a)_, shall not be limited or
otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or
submission to it of any Takeover Proposal (whether or not a Superior
Proposal), or by a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and (ii) in any case
in which the Company makes a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant
to this _Section 5.3_, the Company shall nevertheless submit this Agreement
to a vote of its stockholders; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be
obligated to recommend to its stockholders the adoption of this Agreement at
the Company Stockholders Meeting or to include such a recommendation in the
Proxy Statement if the Board of Directors of the Company makes a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to, and in accordance with the terms
and conditions of, this  _Section 5.3_.

(e) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person from the
restrictions on business combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL
(or any similar provisions) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply,
in each case, unless such actions are taken simultaneously with a termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 



44 (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company (i) from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any disclosure to the
Companys stockholders that the Board of Directors of the Company determines
to make in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) in
order to fulfill its fiduciary duties or satisfy applicable state or federal
securities Laws; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any disclosure of a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) of the Exchange Act other than a rejection of
any applicable Takeover Proposal, a reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation or a "stop-look-and-listen" communication made in compliance
with Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act shall be deemed to be a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and may be made only in compliance with
this _Section 5.3_.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 6.1 _Stockholder Written Consent; Preparation of the Information
Statement or Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_.

 

(a) Immediately after the execution of this Agreement and in lieu of calling a
meeting of the Companys stockholders, the Company shall submit the form of
Stockholder Written Consent attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Stockholder
Written Consent_ ") to the Companys stockholders holding in the aggregate at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. As soon
as reasonably practicable after the Stockholder Written Consent has been duly
executed by the Companys stockholders holding in the aggregate at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (including the
Earnout Shares) and is delivered to the Company in accordance with Section 228
of the DGCL, the Company shall deliver to Parent a copy (including by
facsimile or other electronic image scan transmission) of the
Stockholder Written Consent pursuant to _Section 9.2_ hereof. In the event
that the Stockholder Written Consent is executed and delivered to the Company
pursuant to this _Section 6.1(a)_, the Company shall, as promptly as
practical thereafter, file with the SEC an information statement in
preliminary form of the type contemplated by Rule 14c-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, prepared by the Company with the assistance and approval (not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) of Parent and related to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the " _Information Statement_ "). In
connection with the Stockholder Written Consent, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to comply, and shall comply in all material respects, with
the DGCL, including Section 228 and Section 262 thereof, the Certificate of
Incorporation and the By-Laws of the Company and the Exchange Act, including
Regulation 14C and Schedule 14C promulgated thereunder, as applicable.

(b) If the Stockholder Written Consent is not executed by the Companys
stockholders holding in the aggregate at least a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, and a copy (including by facsimile or other
electronic image scan transmission) thereof is not delivered by the Company
to Parent pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)_, in each case within 24 hours after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties hereto (a "
_Written_  

 



45   _Consent Failure_ "), Parent shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement as set forth in _Section 8.1(g)_. In the event that Parent does not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_, the Company shall, as
promptly as practicable after the expiration of the Written Consent Failure
Termination Period and with the assistance and approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) of Parent, prepare and file
with the SEC a proxy statement (as amended or supplemented from time to time,
the " _Proxy Statement_ ") related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, to be sent to the stockholders of the Company relating
to the meeting of the Companys stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders_ __
_Meeting_ ") to be held for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, shall take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Company Stockholders Meeting on a date as soon as reasonably
practicable following the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and, subject to any
Company Adverse Recommendation Change effected by the Board of Directors of
the Company pursuant to _Section 5.3(b)_ and in accordance with _Section
5.3(c)_, shall take all lawful action to solicit the adoption of this
Agreement by the Companys stockholders in accordance with the DGCL. Unless
the Board of Directors of the Company has effected a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 5.3(b)_ and in accordance with
_Section 5.3(c)_, the Company Board Recommendation shall be included in the
Proxy Statement.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have the Information Statement or the Proxy Statement, as the case may be,
cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable after such filing (including by
responding to comments of the SEC). Each of Parent and the Company shall
furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by the other in
connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution
of the Information Statement or the Proxy Statement, as the case may be. As
promptly as practicable after the Information Statement or the Proxy
Statement, as the case may be, shall have been cleared by the SEC (or, in the
case of the Information Statement, after ten (10) calendar days have
passed since the filing of the preliminary Information Statement with the SEC
without notice from the SEC of its intent to review the Information Statement
or such other date as required by applicable Law), the Company shall cause the
Information Statement or the Proxy Statement, as the case may be, to be
mailed to its stockholders and to be filed in definitive form with the SEC as
required. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Information
Statement or the Proxy Statement, as the case may be, shall be made by the
Company without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers is discovered by the Company or Parent
which information is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Information Statement or the Proxy Statement, as the case may be, so that
the Information Statement or the Proxy Statement, as the case may be, would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of
the time when the Information Statement or the Proxy Statement, as the case
may be, shall have been cleared by the SEC or of the receipt of any comments
or other communications, whether written or oral, from the SEC or the staff
of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff

 



46  of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Information Statement or the
Proxy Statement, as the case may be, or for additional information, and shall
provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to participate
in the Companys response to such comments and other communications, to
provide comments on such response (to which comments reasonable and good faith
consideration shall be given by the Company and its counsel), and to
participate in any discussions or meetings with the SEC relating to the
Information Statement or the Proxy Statement, as the case may be, or any other
matters that are the subject of this Agreement. The parties shall supply
each other with copies of all correspondence between any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand,
with respect to the Information Statement or the Proxy Statement, as the case
may be, or this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents and its Subsidiaries
officers, employees and other authorized Representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours from the date of this Agreement through to the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, to its
employees, properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to
Parent such information concerning the Business and the properties and
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may from time to time
reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
require the Company to (A) provide access to any information or documents
that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, would (i) constitute a
waiver of the attorney-client privilege held by the Company, or (ii) violate
any applicable Laws; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents for the
disclosure of such information or documents and take such other action (such
as entering into a joint defense agreement or other arrangement to avoid loss
of the attorney-client privilege) with respect to such information or
documents as is necessary to permit disclosure to Parent and Parents
Representatives or (B) provide access to any minutes and resolutions of the
Companys Board of Directors (or any authorized committee thereof) adopted
after the date hereof, to the extent relating to the evaluation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or any alternative transactions, including
any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall not be obligated to grant any access
or furnish any information if it would unreasonably and materially interfere
with the conduct of the Companys business.

(b) Each party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, hold all
information received from the other party, directly or indirectly, in
confidence in accordance with, and shall otherwise abide by and be subject to,
the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of May
13, 2011, between an Affiliate of Parent and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "). The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive
any termination of this Agreement.

 

Section 6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and the
Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their
reasonable best efforts 

 



47  to (i) consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable and to obtain or make as promptly as
practicable, and in any event prior to the Outside Date, all Consents that
are or may become necessary, proper or advisable to be obtained or made
respectively by them to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) take all actions as may be requested by
any Governmental Entity to obtain such Consents and (iii) cooperate with the
reasonable requests of each other in seeking to obtain as promptly as
practicable all such Consents. Neither Parent nor the Company shall, and each
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries, not to, take or cause to be taken
any action that they are aware or should reasonably be aware would be intended
to delay, impair or impede in any material respect the receipt or making of
any such Consents (it being understood that obtaining any such Consents from
Persons other than Governmental Entities shall not be deemed to constitute a
condition to the Closing).

(b) Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, promptly make all filings and notifications with all
Governmental Entities that may be or may become necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Antitrust Laws to consummate and make effective the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and
the Company agree to file the initial pre-merger notifications with respect to
the Merger required under the HSR Act (which filing, including the exhibits
thereto, need not be shared or otherwise disclosed to the other party except,
as to the HSR Act filing form (excluding exhibits), to regulatory counsel of
each party) no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement (unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company)
and to make all other filings required to be made under any other Antitrust
Law as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement. Parent and
the Company each shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
supply as promptly as practicable any information and documentary material
that may be requested by any Governmental Entity pursuant to Antitrust Laws
or any other applicable Laws. If a request for additional information has been
issued under the HSR Act or a civil investigative demand or subpoena has been
issued pursuant to any other Antitrust Law, Parent and the Company shall
supply, or cause to be supplied, the information necessary for such party to
certify substantial compliance with the applicable Governmental Entity in
connection with such a request as promptly as practicable such that Parent and
the Company, as applicable, can, if required to do so, certify substantial
compliance with such request as soon as practicable after the issuance
thereof, but in no event later than 120 days of the issuance thereof.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 6.3_, each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted
by a Governmental Entity or other Person with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall each use their reasonable best efforts to (i)
avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or
judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, on or before the Outside Date, and (ii)
avoid or eliminate each impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby so as to enable the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event
no later than the Outside Date), in each case, as may be required in order
obtain any Consents from any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate

 



48  the transactions contemplated hereby or to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other
order in any Action, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in connection with any filing or submission required or
action to be taken by either Parent or the Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, in no event shall Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates be obligated to propose or agree to accept
any undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any
divestiture or accept any operational restriction, or take or commit to take
any action (A) the effectiveness or consummation of which is not conditioned
on the consummation of the Merger or (B) that individually or in the
aggregate is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to (1)
either (x) the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y) Parent
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (it being understood that, for
purposes of this clause (y), materiality shall be measured in relation to the
size of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, instead of the
size of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), in the case of each
clause (x) or (y) above, either before or immediately after giving effect to
the Merger, or (2) Parents ownership or operation of any material portion of
the Business or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
(each, a " _Materially Burdensome Condition_ "). If requested by Parent in
writing, the Company shall agree or commit to take any of the foregoing
actions with respect to the Business or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in furtherance of _Sections 6.3(a)(ii)_ , _6.3(a)(iii)_ ,
_6.3(b)_ and _6.3(c)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
required to agree or commit to take any such action unless such action is
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the sharing of information, in
connection with obtaining or making all Consents from any Governmental Entity
that are or may become necessary, proper or advisable to be obtained or made
to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, promptly notify each other of any communication
it receives from any Governmental Entity and permit the other party to review
in advance any proposed communication by such party to any Governmental Entity
and shall provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings
or communications between such party or any of its Representatives, on the
one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of the staff of any
Governmental Entity, on the other hand, in each case to the extent relating to
the matters that are the subject of this Agreement. In connection with the
efforts to obtain all requisite Consents for the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, Parent shall take
the lead in directing strategy, subject to reasonable consultation with the
Company, in connection with all matters relating to obtaining clearances and
approvals from Governmental Entities and the expiration of waiting periods.
The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, agree to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity relating to the
matters that are the subject of this Agreement unless it consults with Parent
in advance and, to the extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Entity,
gives Parent the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Each
of Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this _Section 6.3_ as "regulatory counsel only." Such
competitively sensitive material and the information contained therein shall
be given only to the recipients outside legal counsel and in-house counsel
responsible for obtaining Consents of Governmental

 



49  Entities ( _provided_ , that such in-house counsels day-to-day
responsibilities are limited only to regulatory and/or antitrust issues) and
will not be disclosed by such regulatory counsel to employees, officers or
directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance
from Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or its legal counsel.

 

Section 6.4 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, all past and present
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the
" _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs, expenses (including attorneys
fees and expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Action arising out of
or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was a director,
officer, employee or fiduciary of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is
or was serving at the request of, or to represent the interest of, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, partner, member,
trustee, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other corporation, partnership,
joint venture, limited liability company, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise, including any charitable or not-for profit public service
organization or trade association, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time (including with respect to acts or omissions
occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby), and provide advancement of expenses to the
Indemnified Parties (within ten (10) days of receipt by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation from an Indemnified Party of a request therefor,
together with an undertaking by such Indemnified Party to repay all amounts
so advanced in the event it is ultimately and finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified hereunder or under applicable Law), to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law as it presently exists or may hereafter be
amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, subject to applicable Law,
only to the extent such amendment permits Parent or the Surviving Corporation
to provide broader indemnification rights or rights of advancement of
expenses than such Law permitted Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
provide prior to such amendment), and (ii) without limitation to clause (i)
above, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, include and cause
to be maintained in effect in the Surviving Corporations (or any successors)
Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws for a period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time, provisions regarding elimination of liability of
directors, and indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors and
officers of the Company, no less favorable than those contained in the
Companys Certificate of Incorporation and the Companys By-Laws,
as applicable.

(b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties,
rights and other assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation
set forth in this _Section 6.4_.

 



50 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase single-premium
prepaid "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policies covering
the period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with respect to acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (a " _Tail Policy_ "),
which Tail Policy shall be effective as of the Effective Time and shall
provide for policy limits, terms, conditions, retentions and levels of
coverage (including as coverage relates to deductibles and exclusions) at
least as favorable in the aggregate to the directors and officers covered
under such insurance policies as the policy limits, terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage in the existing policies of the Company;
_provided_ that the aggregate premium for such Tail Policy shall not exceed
250% of the Companys current aggregate annual premium for its directors and
officers liability insurance policies in effect on the date hereof (which
current aggregate annual premium the Company represents and warrants to be in
the amount set forth in Section 6.4(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter).
Following the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
(or its successor) to, maintain the Tail Policy purchased by the Company
pursuant to this _Section 6.4(c)_ in effect for so long as such Tail Policy
remains in effect in accordance with its terms.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.4_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable from and after the Effective Time by, each
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii)
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or
otherwise.

 

(e) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, perform all the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this  _Section 6.4_.

other plan made available to the Continuing Employees or to terminate any
persons employment at any time and for any reason.

waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had been satisfied by, such employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the relevant Employee Benefit
Plan in which such employee participated, (ii) provide each such employee with
credit for any co-payments and deductible paid prior to the Effective Time (to
the same extent such credit was given under the analogous Employee
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements and (iii) to the extent that any
Continuing Employee is eligible to participate in any employee benefit plan of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries following the
Effective Time, cause such plan to recognize the service of such Continuing
Employee with

 



52  the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting, vacation entitlement and severance
benefits (but not for benefit accrual under any defined benefit, retiree
welfare or any other plan) to the same extent such service was recognized by

which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent

create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of
continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter. Nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed to amend or modify any compensation or benefit
plan, policy, agreement or arrangement sponsored or maintained by Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

54 Section 6.15 _Updated Information_. Prior to the Closing, each party shall
give written notice to the other party of the occurrence, or failure to
occur, after the date of this Agreement, of any fact or event that has caused
or would be reasonably likely to cause (a) a material breach of any
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement or (b) a
material breach or failure by such party to perform any of its obligations set
forth in this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_  of this Agreement to be satisfied;
provided that no such notification (or failure to notify) shall affect the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Article III_ or

Company for any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, the Company shall
pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ from the date such payment was

was required to be made. All payments under this _Section 8.3_ shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by Parent. 

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable under more
than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the
occurrence of different events.

vested in the Federal courts, any court of the United States located in the
State and County of New York without proof of actual damages or otherwise (and
each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.

 



71 (b) In addition, each of the parties hereto (i) hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally consents to submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, if under applicable Law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, any court of the

dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and agrees not to plead or claim any objection to the laying of venue
in any such court or that any judicial proceeding in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any
Action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
Federal courts, any court of the United States located in the State and
County of New York, (iv) hereby appoints CT Corporation as its agent to
receive on its behalf service of copies of the summons and complaint and any
other process that might be served in any such Action or proceeding, (v)
consents to service of process being made by sending or delivering a copy of
the process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner
provided for the giving of notices in  _Section 9.2_ or to the party to be
served in care of CT Corporation at the address and in the manner provided for
the giving of notices in _Section 9.2_ and (vi) agrees that a final judgment
in any Action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be
enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law or at
equity. Nothing in this _Section 9.9(b)_ shall affect the right of any party
to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or at equity.

(c) Without limiting other means of service of process permissible under
applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent hereby agrees that service of
any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the
respective addresses set forth in _Section 9.2_ shall be effective service of
process for any Action in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any Action
seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the
other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among
other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this _Section 9.10_.

Section 9.11 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to
the extent possible.
