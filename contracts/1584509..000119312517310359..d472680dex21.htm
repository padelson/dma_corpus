and may, in its sole discretion, determine whether to reflect any or all of
such comments therein; provided that the Closing shall not be delayed in
respect of any such comments proposed by Buyer and in no event shall the
proposal of such comments or the delivery of such Estimated Closing Statement
be deemed to constitute the agreement of Buyer as to any of the
estimated amounts set forth in such Estimated Closing Statement, and in no
way shall the delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement or the consummation
of the Closing be construed as a waiver by Buyer of its rights under _Section
3.6_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties
acknowledge and agree, and each Pre-Closing Holder shall acknowledge and agree
in such Pre-Closing Holders Letter of Transmittal, if applicable, that Buyer
shall be entitled to rely on the Companys calculation of the Closing Date
Company Unit Consideration, the Distribution Waterfall and the Estimated Per
Interest Payment Amount or UAR Payment Amount payable with respect to each
Pre-Closing Holder set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement, as setting
forth a true, complete and accurate listing of all items set forth therein and
a true, complete and accurate calculation of the amounts to which such Pre-
Closing Holders are entitled pursuant to the Company LLC Agreement and the UAR
Plans, as in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and in no
event shall Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Closing,
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) have any liability to the Pre-
Closing Holders or to any other Person for the calculation or allocation of
any item or amount set forth therein.

 

3.4 _Closing Payments_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of the
Company, to the accounts designated in the Payoff Letter, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Funded Debt as of the
Closing Date (or such other amount as set forth in the Payoff Letter) owing to
the applicable lender parties in accordance with the Payoff Letter. The
Company shall deliver the Payoff Letter to Buyer on or prior to the second
Business Day prior to the Closing.

 

(b) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to each Pre-
Closing Holder (only if such Pre-Closing Holder has duly completed, executed
and delivered to Buyer a Letter of Transmittal at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date), to the account designated in such Pre-Closing
Holders Letter of Transmittal, the portion of the Closing Date Company Unit
Consideration allocated to such Pre-Closing Holder as set forth in
the Distribution Waterfall.

 



18 (c) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the
Company the UAR Payment Amount. The Surviving Company shall thereafter pay to
each Pre-Closing Holder its portion of the UAR Payment Amount set forth next
to such Pre-Closing Holders name in the Distribution Waterfall and via the
Surviving Companys normal payroll practices following the Closing, subject to
applicable withholding Taxes.

 

(d) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the
Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Escrow
Amount for the Escrow Agent to hold (the " _Escrow Account_ ") and to disburse
solely in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and an escrow agreement
to be executed at the Closing by Buyer, the Escrow Agent and the Holder
Representative in substantially the form attached hereto as _Annex D_ (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ ").

 

(e) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Holder
Representative, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the Holder Representative at least one (1) Business
Day prior to the Closing Date, the Holder Representative Holdback Amount.

 

(f) At the Closing, pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_, Buyer shall cause the
Company to deliver to Buyer the number of membership interests in the
Surviving Company equal to the number of membership units of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding and held by Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(g) At the Closing, Buyer shall or shall cause the Company to pay, all
Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses to the parties owed such amounts.

3.5 _Exchange of Company Ownership Interests_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall deliver to each Pre-Closing Holder that holds Company Ownership
Interests a letter of transmittal in substantially the form attached hereto as
_Annex C_ (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), to be completed and delivered by
each such Pre-Closing Holder to effect (subject to the occurrence of the
Closing) the exchange of such Pre-Closing Holders Company Ownership
Interests (including the surrender of any certificates evidencing such
Company Ownership Interests, to the extent applicable) for the payment of the
applicable Estimated Per Interest Payment Amount for each Company Ownership
Interest surrendered thereby, without any interest thereon. Upon completion
and delivery of a duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the Pre-Closing Holder
shall be entitled, following the Effective Time, to receive in exchange for
each Company Ownership Interest surrendered thereby, an amount equal to the
applicable Estimated Per Interest Payment Amount with respect to such Company
Ownership Interest, subject to and in accordance with the Distribution
Waterfall. With respect to any Pre-Closing Holder that delivers a duly
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal (and properly surrenders any
certificates, if applicable) at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Parties shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, cause
Buyer to pay or cause to be paid the applicable Estimated Per Interest Payment
Amount to such Pre-Closing Holder on the Closing Date for each Company
Ownership Interest surrendered by the applicable Letter of Transmittal;
otherwise, Buyer will pay or cause to be paid to such Pre-Closing Holder, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the applicable

 



19  Estimated Per Interest Payment Amount for each Company Ownership Interest
surrendered by the applicable Letter of Transmittal no later than five (5)
Business Days following receipt of such duly executed and completed Letter of
Transmittal (and proper surrender of any certificates, if applicable). Until
any such duly executed Letter of Transmittal is delivered (and any applicable
certificates surrendered) as contemplated by this  _Section 3.5_, each
Company Ownership Interest (other than the Excluded Equity Interests) shall be
deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to
receive the payment of the consideration set forth in  _Section 3.2_.

(b) All payments in respect of Company Ownership Interests by Buyer shall
be made by check or wire transfer in accordance with the instructions set
forth in the applicable Letter of Transmittal.

 

(c) If any Company Ownership Interests are not surrendered in accordance
with _Section 3.5(a)_ prior to the date that is one (1) year after the
Effective Time, any such unclaimed amounts (including interest thereon, if
any) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be delivered to and
become the property of the Surviving Company, and may be commingled with the
general funds of the Surviving Company, free of interest. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any Pre-Closing Holder who has not previously complied with the
provisions of this  _Section 3.5_ shall be entitled to receive, upon demand
and compliance with the provisions of this _Section 3.5_, only from the
Surviving Company or Buyer, payment of the aggregate Per Interest Payment
Amount to which such Pre-Closing Holder is entitled in respect of its Company
Ownership Interests, and may surrender any Company Ownership Interests
(including the surrender of any certificates evidencing such Company
Ownership Interests, to the extent applicable) to the Surviving Company or
Buyer and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws)
receive in exchange therefor the aggregate Per Interest Payment Amount to
which such Pre-Closing Holder is entitled for its Company Ownership Interests,
without any interest thereon. None of Buyer, Merger Sub, or the Company shall
be liable to any Person for any amount delivered to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(d) Except as required by Law, no distributions with respect to Equity
Interests of the Surviving Company with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Ownership Interest.

 

(e) All Merger Consideration paid in respect of the surrender or exchange
of Company Ownership Interests in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to be in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company
Ownership Interests. If, after the Effective Time, Company Ownership Interests
are presented to Buyer or the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Section 3.5_.

(f) If any consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Company Ownership Interests surrendered in exchange therefor
is registered, it shall be a condition to such exchange that the Person
requesting such exchange shall deliver all documents reasonably required to
evidence and effect such transfer and shall pay to the Surviving Company any
transfer or other Taxes payable by the Surviving Company required by reason of
the payment of such consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Company Ownership Interest so surrendered, or such Person shall
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Company that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 



20 (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
any certificate representing Company Ownership Interests shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Company or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Company or the Surviving
Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such certificate, the Surviving Corporation shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

3.6 _Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustment and Payments_.

 

(a) _Delivery of Closing Statement_. As promptly as practicable, but not
later than sixty (60) days after the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to the
Holder Representative a written statement (the " _Proposed Closing Statement_
") setting forth in reasonable detail Buyers good faith determination of (i)
the Closing Cash Amount, (ii) the Closing Debt Amount, (iii) the Closing Net
Working Capital and (iv) the Closing Transaction Expenses, and based on such
calculations, Buyers proposed calculations of the Merger Consideration and
the Adjustment Amount. The Proposed Closing Statement shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with the Estimated Closing Statement, provided that, to the
extent the Estimated Closing Statement was prepared in a manner inconsistent
with this Agreement, the requirements of this Agreement shall control. The
Parties agree that the purpose of preparing the Proposed Closing Statement and
determining the Closing Cash Amount, the Closing Debt Amount, the Closing Net
Working Capital and the Closing Transaction Expenses and the related merger
consideration adjustment contemplated by this _Section 3.6_ is to measure the
Closing Cash Amount, the Closing Debt Amount, the Closing Net Working Capital
and the Closing Transaction Expenses, in each case, in accordance with the
applicable defined terms, and such processes are not intended to permit the
introduction of different judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles,
practices, procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies for
the purpose of preparing the Proposed Closing Statement or determining the
Closing Cash Amount, the Closing Debt Amount, the Closing Net Working Capital
and the Closing Transaction Expenses, or the resulting calculation of Merger
Consideration, provided that, to the extent the Estimated Closing Statement
was prepared in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the requirements of
this Agreement shall control. At the Holder Representatives reasonable
written request, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, employees, agents and
representatives to, provide reasonable assistance during regular business
hours to the Holder Representative and its agents in their review of
the Proposed Closing Statement and shall provide the Holder Representative
and its agents access at reasonable times to the personnel, properties, books
and records (including any Tax Returns) of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the extent reasonably necessary for such purpose and for the other purposes
set forth in this Section 3.6, subject to execution of any applicable
customary access letters required by accountants. The Closing Cash Amount, the
Closing Debt Amount, the Closing Net Working Capital and the Closing
Transaction Expenses, as finally determined in accordance with this Section
3.6, shall be deemed to be the final and binding calculations of the "Closing
Cash Amount", the "Closing Debt Amount", the "Closing Net Working Capital"
and the "Closing Transaction Expenses" for all purposes of this _Section
3.6_, including for purposes of calculating the Merger Consideration.

 



21 (b) _Notice of Disagreement_. In the event the Holder
Representative disputes the correctness of the Proposed Closing Statement,
the Holder Representative shall notify Buyer in writing of its objections
within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Proposed Closing Statement (the "
_Review Period_ ") and shall set forth, in writing and in reasonable detail
(including the proposed amounts), the reasons for the Holder Representatives
objections (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ "). Any component of the Proposed
Closing Statement as to which no objection is raised in the Notice of
Disagreement shall be deemed final and binding on the Parties for all purposes
of this _Section 3.6_.

 

(c) _Initial Method of Resolution_. During the fifteen (15) days
immediately following the delivery of any Notice of Disagreement, Buyer and
the Holder Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve any differences
that they may have with respect to any matter specified in such Notice of
Disagreement. During such period, Buyer and the Holder Representative and
their respective agents shall each have reasonable access to the other Partys
working papers, trial balances and similar materials prepared in connection
with the other Partys preparation of the Proposed Closing Statement and the
Notice of Disagreement, as the case may be; _provided_ , that such access will
be subject to the execution of any customary applicable access letters
required by accountants. The matters set forth in any such written
resolution executed by Buyer and the Holder Representative shall be final and
binding on the Parties on the date of such written resolution for all purposes
of this _Section 3.6_.

 

(d) _Dispute Resolution Procedure_. If, at the end of such fifteen (15)
day period specified in  _Section 3.6(c)_ (or such longer period agreed to
between Buyer and the Holder Representative), Buyer and the Holder
Representative have not been able to resolve, in writing, all differences that
they may have with respect to any matter specified in such Notice of
Disagreement, Buyer and the Holder Representative shall submit to Ernst and
Young or, if such firm is unable to serve in such capacity, to such other
nationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually agreed to by Buyer
and the Holder Representative (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for review and
resolution of solely those matters specified in such Notice of Disagreement
that remain in dispute, and the Accounting Firm shall reach a final, binding
resolution of such matters, which final resolution shall be (i) in writing and
signed by the Accounting Firm, (ii) within the range of the amount of each
item in dispute contested by the Holder Representative and Buyer on an
item by item basis, (iii) furnished to Buyer and the Holder Representative as
soon as practicable after the items in dispute have been referred to the
Accounting Firm, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days after such
referral, (iv) made in accordance with the applicable defined terms of the
components of Merger Consideration in this Agreement, and (v) conclusive and
binding upon the Parties on the date of delivery of such written resolution
for all purposes of this _Section 3.6_, absent fraud, bad faith or manifest
error. In acting under this Agreement, the Accounting Firm shall function
solely as an expert and not as an arbitrator. Buyer and the Holder
Representative agree to execute, if requested by the Accounting Firm, a
reasonable engagement letter in customary form. Buyer and the Holder
Representative agree to cooperate fully with the Accounting Firm and promptly
provide all documents and information reasonably requested by the Accounting
Firm so as to enable it to make such determination as quickly and as
accurately as practicable. The procedure outlined in this _Section 3.6(d)_ is
referred to as the " _Dispute Resolution Procedure_ ".

 



22 (e) _Final Closing Statement_. The Proposed Closing Statement
shall become the " _Final Closing Statement_ " on the earlier of (w) the
first (1st) day following the end of the Review Period, if a Notice of
Disagreement has not been delivered to Buyer by the Holder Representative,
(x) the date upon which the Holder Representative acknowledges in writing that
it has no objections to the Proposed Closing Statement, (y) the date of
resolution of all matters set forth in the Notice of Disagreement pursuant to
_Section 3.6(c)_ and (z) the date upon which the Accounting Firm reaches a
final, binding resolution of solely those matters specified in any Notice of
Disagreement pursuant to _Section 3.6(d)_. The date on which the Proposed
Closing Statement shall become the Final Closing Statement pursuant to the
immediately foregoing sentence is referred to as the " _Final Determination
Date_ ".

 

(f) _Dispute Resolution Expenses_. Buyer and the Holder Representative
shall each pay their own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
Dispute Resolution Procedure. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be allocated to and borne by Buyer and the Holder Representative
(for the account of the Pre-Closing Holders) based on the inverse of the
percentage that the Accounting Firms determination (before such allocation)
bears to the total amount of the total items in dispute as
originally submitted to the Accounting Firm. For example, should the items in
dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Accounting Firm awards $600 in favor
of the Holder Representatives position, 60% of the costs of its review would
be borne by Buyer and 40% of the costs would be borne by the Holder
Representative (for the account of the Pre-Closing Holders). The Holder
Representative shall be reimbursed by the Pre-Closing Holders in accordance
with _Section _11.18 for any Charges incurred by the Holder Representative
under this _Section 3.6_, including, without limitation, for the reasonable
fees and expenses of any accountants, advisors or other representatives
engaged by the Holder Representative in connection with the determination of
the Final Closing Statement under this _Section 3.6_ (including, without
limitation, any Dispute Resolution Procedure, hereunder).

3.7 _Final Adjustment Payment_.

 

(a) Promptly following the Final Determination Date, and in any event
within five (5) Business Days thereof, the Holder Representative shall
deliver to Buyer the Updated Distribution Waterfall. No later than the fifth
(5th) Business Day following the delivery of the Updated Distribution
Waterfall:

 

(i) if the Adjustment Amount is positive:

 

A. Buyer shall pay to each Pre-Closing Holder of Company Ownership
Interests (only if such Pre-Closing Holder has duly completed, executed and
delivered to Buyer a Letter of Transmittal at least five (5) Business Days
prior to the date of such payment), to the account designated in such Pre-
Closing Holders Letter of Transmittal, the portion of such Adjustment Amount
as set forth in the applicable Updated Distribution Waterfall; _provided_ ,
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall the amount payable in respect of the Adjustment Amount pursuant to this
_Section 3.7(a)(i)_ exceed the Escrow Amount; and

 



23 B. Buyer and the Holder Representative shall provide a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to release the applicable portion of the
Escrow Amount to each Pre-Closing Holder of Company Ownership Interests (only
if such Pre-Closing Holder has duly completed, executed and delivered to
Buyer a Letter of Transmittal at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
date of such payment), to the account designated in such Pre-Closing Holders
Letter of Transmittal, as set forth in the applicable Updated Distribution
Waterfall.

 

(ii) If the Adjustment Amount is negative, Buyer and the Holder
Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to (x) release the lesser of the (A) absolute
value of the Adjustment Amount and (B) the Escrow Amount, to Buyer from the
Escrow Account, and (y) release any portion of the Escrow Amount remaining,
following such payment to Buyer pursuant to clause (x) above, to each Pre-
Closing Holder of Company Ownership Interests (only if such Pre-Closing
Holder has duly completed, executed and delivered to Buyer a Letter of
Transmittal at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date of such
payment), to the account designated in such Pre-Closing Holders Letter of
Transmittal, as set forth in the applicable Updated Distribution Waterfall.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyers
sole recourse for payment of any such negative Adjustment Amount pursuant to
_Section 3.7(a)(ii)_ shall be the Escrow Amount, and neither Buyer nor the
Surviving Company nor or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any
claim against any Pre-Closing Holder or the Holder Representative or any of
their respective Affiliates in respect thereof.

 

(c) Any amount paid in respect of the Adjustment Amount (whether positive
or negative) pursuant to this _Article III_ shall be treated by the Parties
as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes.

 

3.8 _Withholding_. Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise paid or deliverable in connection
with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, to any Person such
amounts that Buyer and the Company are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to any such deliveries and payments under the Code or any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall
use commercially reasonably efforts to notify the Company in writing of any
such requirement to deduct or withhold at least ten (10) days before the
payment to which such deduction or withholding would apply (other than amounts
subject to withholding as compensation). To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, and duly deposited with the appropriate Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable Law, by Buyer or the Company, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. Buyer or
the Company shall promptly deliver to such Person receipts or other evidence
of the remittance of such amounts (other than amounts subject to withholding
as compensation).

4.1 _Corporate Organization of the Company_. The Company has been duly
organized and is validly existing as a limited liability company in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite
organizational power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and assets and to conduct its business as it is now being conducted. The
copies of the certificate of formation and Company LLC Agreement of the
Company previously made available by the Company to Buyer are true and
complete. The Company is duly licensed or qualified and (where applicable) in
good standing as a legal entity in each jurisdiction in which the ownership of
its property or the character of its activities is such as to require it to be
so licensed or qualified, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

 

4.2 _Subsidiaries_. The Subsidiaries of the Company, their jurisdiction
of incorporation or organization and, for any such Subsidiary which is not
wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company, the percentage interest
of the Company in such Subsidiary, are set forth on _Schedule 4.2_. The
Subsidiaries have been duly formed or organized and are validly existing
under the laws of their jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and have
the power and authority to own or lease their properties and to conduct their
business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so
formed, organized or existing, or to have such power and authority, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
Company has previously provided to Buyer true and complete copies of the
organizational documents of its Subsidiaries. Each Subsidiary is duly licensed
or qualified and (where applicable) in good standing as a foreign or extra-
provincial corporation (or other entity, if applicable) in each jurisdiction
in which its ownership of property or the character of its activities is such
as to require it to be so licensed or qualified or in good standing, as
applicable, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified or in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

4.3 _Due Authorization_. The Company has all requisite organizational
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and (subject to the
Merger Consent and the approvals described in _Section 4.5_) to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, performance and delivery

the Company, and no other organizational proceeding on the part of the
Company is necessary to authorize this Agreement (other than the Merger
Consent). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
the Company and (assuming this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Buyer and Merger Sub) constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting
creditors rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general
principles of equity (collectively, the " _Remedies Exception_ ").

receipt of the consents, approvals, authorizations and other requirements set
forth in _Section 4.5_ or on _Schedule 4.5_ , and except as may result from
any facts or circumstances relating solely to Buyer, the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or compliance by the Company with the terms

breach of, any applicable Law to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is subject or by which any property or asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound, (b) conflict with the certificate of formation,
limited liability company agreement or other organizational documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (c) violate any provision of or result in
a breach of any Contract to which the Company or one of its Subsidiaries is a

terminate or result in the termination of any such Contract, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or constitute an event which, after notice or lapse
of time or both, would result in any such violation, breach, termination or
creation of a Lien or (d) result in a violation or revocation of any required
license, permit or approval from any Governmental Authority or other Person,
except to the extent that the occurrence of any of the foregoing items set
forth in clauses (a), (c) or (d) would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

4.5 _Governmental Authorities; Consents_. No consent, approval or
authorization of, or designation, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Authority or other Person is required on the part of the Company
with respect to the Companys execution or delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (a)
applicable requirements of the HSR Act or any similar foreign Law; (b) any
consents, approvals, authorizations, designations, declarations or filings,
the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company; (c) compliance with any applicable requirements
of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities Laws; (d) as
otherwise disclosed on _Schedule 4.5_ ; and (e) the filing of the Certificate
of Merger in accordance with the Act.

other commitments or agreements providing for the issuance of additional
Equity Interests of such Subsidiaries, the sale of Equity Interests of such
Subsidiaries, or for the repurchase or redemption of Equity Interests of such
Subsidiaries, or any agreements of any kind which may obligate any Subsidiary
of the Company to issue, purchase, register for sale, redeem or otherwise
acquire any of its Equity Interests. Except for the Equity Interests of the
Subsidiaries set forth on _Schedule 4.2_ , none of the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries own any equity, partnership, membership or similar interest in

and no other organizational proceeding on the part of Buyer or Merger Sub is
necessary to authorize this Agreement (other than the adoption of this
Agreement by Buyer in its capacity as the sole member of Merger Sub, which

Merger Sub). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by each of Buyer and Merger Sub and (assuming this Agreement constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company) this Agreement constitutes
a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Buyer and Merger Sub,
enforceable against Buyer and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms,
subject to the Remedies Exception.

 

5.3 _No Conflict_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.3_ , the execution

of the transactions contemplated hereby or compliance by Buyer and Merger Sub

with the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational
documents of Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer (including Merger Sub), or (c)

or any Subsidiary of Buyer (including Merger Sub) may be bound, or terminate
or result in the termination of any such Contract, or result in the creation
of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Buyer or any Subsidiary of
Buyer (including Merger Sub) or constitute an event which, after notice or
lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to result in any such
violation, breach, termination or creation of a Lien, except to the extent
that the occurrence of the foregoing items set forth in clauses (a) or (c)
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer or
Merger Sub.

 

5.4 _Litigation and Proceedings_. There are no lawsuits, Actions, suits,
claims or other proceedings at law or in equity, outstanding Orders against
Buyer or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Buyer, investigations, pending
before or by any Governmental Authority or, to the knowledge of Buyer,
threatened, against Buyer or Merger Sub which, if determined adversely, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer or Merger
Sub.

 5.5 _Governmental Consents_. No consent, approval or authorization of,
or designation, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority or
other Person is required on the part of Buyer or Merger Sub with respect to

other applicable securities Laws, (c) the filing of the Certificate of Merger
in accordance with the Act, and (d) as otherwise disclosed on _Schedule 5.5_.

 

5.6 _Financial Ability; No Prior Activities_.

 

(a) Buyer and Merger Sub will have at the Closing, cash on hand and/or
amounts available under existing credit facilities (including the proceeds of
any Debt Financing) necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Founder Commercial Agreements including (a) paying the
Merger Consideration at the Closing, (b) effecting the repayment or
refinancing of all Funded Debt as of the Closing Date and (c) effecting the
payment of Company Transaction Expenses, (d) paying all other related fees and
expenses when due and (e) to perform its other obligations under this
Agreement. In no event shall the receipt or availability of any Debt Financing
by Buyer or any Affiliate thereof be a condition to any of Buyers obligations
hereunder.

 

(b) Buyer has received and accepted one or more executed debt commitment
letters, dated as of the date hereof (including all exhibits, schedules,
annexes and amendments to such letter in effect as of the date hereof and
including the fee letter (in a redacted form removing only the fees, pricing
caps, economic terms and "market flex" provisions, which redacted information
does not relate to the amounts, termination or conditionality of, or contain
any conditions precedent to, the funding of the Debt Financing))
(collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ "), 

 



38  from each of the Debt Financing Sources party thereto who has committed to
provide Debt Financing on the terms and conditions of the applicable Debt
Commitment Letter. Buyer has delivered to the Company true and correct copies
of the Debt Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of
Buyer, the Debt Commitment Letters (i) are in full force and effect and are
the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of each party thereto,
subject to the Remedies Exception, (ii) have not been amended, restated or
otherwise modified or waived, and the respective commitments contained therein
have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect, and, to the knowledge of
Buyer, no such withdrawal, termination or rescission is contemplated and (iii)
constitute all of the Contracts entered into between each of the Debt
Financing Sources, on one hand, and Buyer and/or its Affiliates, on the other
hand, with respect to the Debt Financing (except for a customary debt
securities engagement letter with respect to a potential offering by Buyer to
fund all or a portion of the Debt Financing, _provided_ that such engagement
letter shall not expand the scope of the Companys obligations with respect
to financing cooperation beyond those set forth in _Section 8.5_). Assuming
the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true
and correct in all material respects and the conditions set forth in
_Sections 9.1_ and _9.2_ hereof are satisfied, as of the date hereof, Buyer
has no reason to believe (both before and after giving effect to any "flex"
provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters) that it will be unable
to satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or condition to be satisfied by it
contained in the Debt Commitments Letters or that the full amount necessary to
pay Merger Consideration on the Closing Date will not be available as of the
Closing if the terms or conditions to be satisfied by it contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters are satisfied. As of the date hereof, there are no (i)
conditions precedent related to the Debt Financing, or (ii) any Contracts,
arrangements or understandings related to the Debt Financing (in case of this
clause (ii), except for a customary debt securities engagement letter with
respect to a potential offering by Buyer to fund all or a portion of the Debt
Financing, _provided_ that such engagement letter shall not expand the scope
of the Companys obligations with respect to financing cooperation beyond
those set forth in _Section 8.5_), in each case other than the terms thereof
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters. All commitment fees or other fees or
deposits required to be paid under the Debt Commitment Letters on or prior to
the date hereof have been paid in full.

 

(c) The Debt Financing is not subject to any condition of any kind
whatsoever, including any subsequent approval process, related to the funding
of the full amount of the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters, other than as expressly set forth therein. Assuming the
representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true
and correct in all material respects, as of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer or, to the knowledge of
Buyer, any other party thereto under any of the Debt Commitment Letters, and
to the knowledge of Buyer no event has occurred or circumstance exists that,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be
expected to (i) constitute or result in a breach or default on the part of
any Person under any of the Debt Commitment Letters, (ii) constitute or result
in a failure to satisfy any of the terms or conditions set forth in any of the
Debt Commitment Letters, (iii) make any of the assumptions or any of the
statements set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters inaccurate in any material
respect or (iv) otherwise result in any portion of the Debt Financing not
being available.

 



39 5.7 _Brokers  Fees_. No broker, finder, investment banker or other
Person is entitled to any brokerage fee, finders fee or other commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, in each case, that would
be payable by the Pre-Closing Holders.

 

5.8 _Solvency; Surviving Company After the Merger_. None of Buyer or
Merger Sub is entering into this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors. Assuming (i) that the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all material
respects and (ii) that any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company
and its Subsidiaries that were prepared by the Company or its Subsidiaries and
made available to Buyer have been prepared in good faith based upon
assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable as of the Closing, and
after giving effect to the Merger and consummation of the Debt Financing, at
and immediately after the Effective Time, each of Buyer and the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries (a) will be solvent (in that both the fair value
of its assets will not be less than the sum of its debts and that the present
fair saleable value of its assets will not be less than the amount required
to pay its probable liability on its recourse debts as they mature or become
due); (b) will have access to adequate capital and liquidity with which to
engage in its business; and (c) will not have incurred and does not plan to
incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature or become due.

5.9 _No Outside Reliance_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
_Article V_ or any other provision hereof, each of Buyer and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates, nor
any of its or their respective managers, directors, officers, employees,
stockholders, partners, members, agents or representatives, has made, or is
making, any representation or warranty whatsoever, oral or written, express or
implied (and neither Buyer nor Merger Sub has relied on any representation,
warranty or other statement of the Company or any of its Affiliates, or any of
its or their respective managers, directors, officers, employees,
stockholders, partners, members, agents or representatives), beyond those
expressly given in _Article IV_ , including any implied warranty or
representation as to condition, merchantability, suitability or fitness for a
particular purpose or trade as to any of the assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is
understood that any cost estimates, financial or other projections or other
predictions that may be contained or referred to in the Schedules or
elsewhere, as well as any information, documents or other materials
(including any such materials contained in any "data room" or reviewed by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, agents or representatives pursuant to the
Confidentiality Agreement) or management presentations or due
diligence discussions that have been or shall hereafter be provided to or
engaged in with Buyer or any of its Affiliates, agents or representatives are
not and will not be deemed to be representations or warranties of the Company,
and no representation or warranty is made as to the accuracy or completeness
of any of the foregoing except as may be expressly set forth in this
Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, each
of Buyer and Merger Sub understands and agrees that, should the Closing
occur, any inventory, equipment, vehicles, assets, properties and business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries are furnished "as is," "where is" and,
subject only to the representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_
, with all faults and without any other representation or warranty of any
nature whatsoever.

 



40 5.10 _Acquisition of Interests for Investment_. Each of Buyer and Merger
Sub has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that
it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its participation in the
Merger. Each of Buyer and Merger Sub confirms that the Company has made
available to Buyer and Merger Sub and Buyers and Merger Subs agents and
representatives the opportunity to ask questions of the officers and
management employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as well as access
to the documents, information and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and to acquire additional information about the business and financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and each of Buyer and Merger
Sub confirms that it has made an independent investigation, analysis and
evaluation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
properties, assets, business, financial condition, documents, information and
records. Buyer is acquiring the membership interests of the Surviving Company
for investment and not with a view toward or for sale in connection with any
distribution thereof, or with any present intention of distributing or selling
membership interests of the Surviving Company. Buyer understands and agrees
that membership interests of the Surviving Company may not be sold,
transferred, offered for sale, pledge, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of
without registration under the Securities Act, except pursuant to an exemption
from such registration available under such Act, and without compliance with
state, local and foreign securities Laws, in each case, to the extent
applicable.

 

5.11 _No Additional Representation or Warranties_. Except as provided in
this  _Article V_ , neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates, nor any of their
respective managers, directors, officers, employees, stockholders, partners,
members, agents or representatives has made, or is making, any representation
or warranty whatsoever to the Company or its Affiliates, oral or written,
express or implied, and Buyer hereby disclaims any such other representations
and warranties, and, except as provided in this _Article V_ or in the case of
Fraud, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates, nor any of their respective
managers, directors, officers, employees, stockholders, partners, members,
agents or representatives shall be liable in respect of the accuracy or
completeness of any information provided to the Company or its Affiliates.

ARTICLE VII.

COVENANTS OF BUYER

 

7.1 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer agrees that it shall honor all
rights to indemnification and exoneration (including expense advancement)
currently held by each present and former director, manager, officer, employee
and agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director, manager, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director, manager, officer, employee or agent of any other
person, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company

 



44  or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been permitted
under applicable Law and its respective certificate of incorporation, bylaws
or other organizational documents in effect on the date of this Agreement to
indemnify such person (including promptly advancing expenses as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the
foregoing, the Surviving Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall (i)
maintain for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time
provisions in its certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other
organizational documents concerning the indemnification and exoneration
(including provisions relating to expense advancement) of the Companys and
its Subsidiaries former and current officers, managers, directors, employees,
and agents that are no less favorable to those Persons than the provisions of
the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other organizational documents
of the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, in each case, as of the date
of this Agreement and (ii) not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such
provisions in any respect that would adversely affect the rights of those
Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by Law.

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall maintain in effect directors and officers liability insurance
covering those Persons who are currently covered by the Companys or any of
its Subsidiaries directors and officers liability insurance policies on
terms not less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Buyer or the Surviving Company may satisfy
this obligation by causing coverage to be extended under the current
directors and officers liability insurance by obtaining at or prior to the
Closing a prepaid, non-cancelable six-year "tail" policy containing terms not
less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage) with respect
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, which
policy shall not be required to cost more than a single payment equal to 250%
of the Companys current annual directors and officers liability insurance
premium and (ii) if any claim is asserted or made within such six-year period,
any insurance required to be maintained under this _Section 7.1_ shall be
continued in respect of such claim until the final disposition thereof.

 

(c) The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of expenses as
provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which any Person entitled to indemnification under this _Section 7.1_ (an
" _Indemnified Person_ ") may at any time be entitled. No right or remedy
herein conferred on an Indemnified Person by this Agreement is intended to be
exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy of an
Indemnified Person shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right
and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at Law or in equity
or otherwise. The assertion by an Indemnified Person of any right or remedy
hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent or subsequent
assertion by such Indemnified Person of any other right or remedy.
Buyer hereby acknowledges that the Indemnified Persons may have or may, in
the future, have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and/or insurance provided by other Persons (collectively, " _Other
Indemnitors_ "). Buyer hereby agrees that, with respect to any advancement or
indemnification obligation owed, at any time, to an Indemnified Person by
Buyer, the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Other
Indemnitor, whether pursuant to any certificate of incorporation, bylaws,
certificate of formation, limited liability company agreement, partnership
agreement, operating agreement, indemnification agreement or other document or
agreement and/or pursuant to this _Section 7.1_ (any of the foregoing, an "
_Indemnification Obligation_ "), the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall

 



45  (i) jointly and severally, and at all times, be the indemnitors of first
resort (i.e., the Surviving Companys and its Subsidiaries obligations to an
Indemnified Person shall be primary and any obligation of the Other
Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same
expenses or liabilities incurred by an Indemnified Person shall be secondary),
(ii) at all times, be required to advance, and shall be liable, jointly and
severally, for, the full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines
and amounts paid in settlement to the extent legally permitted and as required
by the terms of this Agreement or any Indemnification Obligation,
without regard to any rights that an Indemnified Person may have against the
Other Indemnitors. Furthermore, Buyer irrevocably waives, relinquishes and
releases the Other Indemnitors from any and all claims (x) against the Other
Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation, indemnification or any other
recovery of any kind in respect thereof and (y) that the Indemnified Person
must seek expense advancement or reimbursement, or indemnification, from any
Other Indemnitor before the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries or Buyer
must perform its expense advancement and reimbursement, and indemnification
obligations, under this Agreement. Buyer hereby further agrees that no
advancement, indemnification or other payment by the Other Indemnitors on
behalf of an Indemnified Person with respect to any claim for which an
Indemnified Person has sought indemnification from Buyer or the Surviving
Company or its Subsidiaries shall affect the foregoing, and the Other
Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the
extent of such advancement, indemnification or other payment to all of the
rights of recovery of such Indemnified Person against Buyer, the Surviving
Company or its Subsidiaries, and Buyer or the Surviving Company or its
Subsidiaries shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Other
Indemnitors against such amounts actually paid by the Other Indemnitors to or
on behalf of such Indemnified Person to the extent such amounts would have
otherwise been payable by Buyer or the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries
under any Indemnification Obligation.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
this _Section 7.1_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely
and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of
Buyer and the Surviving Company. In the event that Buyer or the Surviving
Company or any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
company or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Buyer or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed
to the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.1_.

 

(e) Buyer shall assume, and be jointly and severally liable for, and shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to honor, each of the covenants in
this _Section 7.1_.

7.2 _Employment Matters_.

(a) Buyer agrees that for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall provide (or cause the Surviving Company to provide) each
employee who continues in the employ of Buyer, the Surviving Company or any of
their Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (a " _Continuing Employee_ ")
(i) an annual base salary or wage rate, (ii) severance benefits, (iii) short
term incentive compensation opportunities and (iv) other compensation and
other benefits that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable or
superior to those provided to 

 



46  the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. This _Section
7.2_ shall not limit the obligation of Buyer, the Surviving Company or their
Subsidiaries to maintain any compensation arrangement or benefit plan that,
pursuant to an existing contract or applicable Law, must be maintained for a
period longer than one year. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed
as a guarantee of continued employment of any Continuing Employee and this
Agreement shall not be construed so as to prohibit Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries from having the right to terminate the employment of any
Continuing Employee, _provided_ that any such termination is effected
in accordance with applicable Law.

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall give each Continuing Employee
full credit for all purposes (including for purposes of eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, early retirement eligibility and early
retirement subsidies, vesting and benefit accrual) under any employee benefit
plans, arrangements, collective agreements and employment-related
entitlements (including under any applicable pension, 401(k), savings,
medical, dental, life insurance, vacation, long-service leave or other leave
entitlements, post-retirement health and life insurance, termination
indemnity, severance or separation pay plans) provided, sponsored, maintained
or contributed to by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries for such Continuing
Employees service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and with
any predecessor employer, to the same extent recognized by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, except to the extent such credit would result in the
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

 

(c) Buyer shall (i) waive for each Continuing Employee and his or her
dependents, any waiting period provision, payment requirement to avoid a
waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation, actively-at-work
requirement and any other restriction that would prevent immediate or full
participation under the health and welfare plans of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries applicable to such Continuing Employee to the extent such waiting
period, pre-existing condition limitation, actively-at-work requirement or
other restriction would not have been applicable to such Continuing Employee
under the terms of the health and welfare plans of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and (ii) give full credit under the health and welfare plans of
Buyer and its Subsidiaries applicable to each Continuing Employee and his or
her dependents for all co-payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the
Closing in the same plan year as the Closing, and for any lifetime maximums or
out-of-pocket maximums, in each of clause (i) and (ii), as if there had been a
single continuous employer.

 

(d) Unless otherwise requested by Buyer, effective immediately prior to
Closing, the Company and any applicable Subsidiary shall terminate any and
all Company Benefit Plans intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code (each a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "
and collectively, the " _Company 401(k) Plans_ "), and effective immediately
prior to the Closing none of the employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall have any right thereafter to contribute any amounts to any
such Company 401(k) Plan. At the request of Buyer, the Company will provide
Buyer with evidence that each Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated
effective immediately prior to the Closing pursuant to resolutions duly
adopted by the Company Board or the board of directors of a Subsidiary,
as applicable. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to
review and approval of Buyer. The Company also shall take such other actions
in furtherance of terminating such Company 401(k) Plans as Buyer may
reasonably require. In the event that termination of a Company 401(k) Plan
would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender

 



47  charges or other fees then the Company shall take such actions as are
necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and
provide such estimate in writing to Buyer no later than ten calendar days
prior to Closing.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.2_ to the contrary,
nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an
establishment, amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or
any employee benefit plan of Buyer or any of its Affiliates. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section 7.2_
are included for their sole benefit, and that nothing in this _Section 7.2_,
whether express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other
rights in any other Person, including any Continuing Employee, any
participant in any Company Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof.

 

7.3 _Retention of Books and Records_. Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries to retain all books, ledgers, files, reports,
plans, operating records and any other material documents pertaining to the
Company and its Subsidiaries in existence at the Closing that are required to
be retained under current retention policies for a period of seven (7) years
from the Closing Date, and use commercially reasonable efforts to make the
same available after the Closing for inspection and copying by the Company
Members or their representatives at such Persons expense, during regular
business hours and upon reasonable request and upon reasonable advance notice,
solely to the extent relating to and solely for the use in connection with any
insurance claims, actions, legal proceedings or Tax audits against, or
preparation of governmental, regulatory or securities exchange reporting
obligations by, or compliance with applicable Law by, or the resolution of any
claims made against or incurred by, the Company Members in respect of
periods prior to the Closing. To the extent Buyer or the Surviving Company
and its Subsidiaries proposes to destroy or dispose of any such books,
ledgers, files, reports, plans, operating records or any other material
documents at the end of such seven (7) year period, Buyer shall first offer,
in writing at least ninety (90) days prior to such proposed destruction or
disposition, to surrender all or any portion of such records to the Company
Members prior to the Effective Time (or copies thereof, if more than one
Company Member requests such records), such Persons shall then have the right
to cause any such records (or copies thereof) to be delivered to them upon
request and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide all
reasonable assistance requested by the such Persons in connection therewith.

 

7.4 _Contact with Customers and Suppliers_. Until the Closing Date, Buyer
shall not, and shall cause its representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, contact or communicate with the employees, customers, suppliers,
distributors or licensors of the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries,
concerning the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, the Founders (in each case,
except in the ordinary course unrelated to the transactions contemplated
hereby) or transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent
of the Company.

 

ARTICLE VIII.

8.1 _Support of Transaction_. Without limiting any covenant contained in
_Article VI_ or _Article VII_ , Buyer and the Company shall each, and shall
each cause their respective

 



48  Subsidiaries to: (a) use reasonable best efforts to assemble, prepare and

all material consents and approvals of third parties that any of Buyer, the

its Subsidiaries be obligated to bear any material expense or pay any
material fee or grant any material concession in connection with obtaining any
consents, authorizations or approvals required in order to consummate the
Merger pursuant to the terms of any Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party.

8.2 _Member Approval_. As soon as practicable after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall take all action necessary in
accordance with the Act and the Companys certificate of formation and limited
liability company agreement, to solicit and obtain the written consent of
holders of at least a majority of the Company Ownership Interests, in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Annex E_ , to adopt this Agreement
and approve the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Merger Consent_ "). The Company shall cause the Merger Consent to be
delivered to Buyer as promptly as practicable and in no event later than 5.00
p.m. ET on the first Business Day after the date of this Agreement.
Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Buyer, as

and the related transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the Act
and Buyers and Merger Subs organizational documents.

8.3 _Further Assurances_. Each party hereto agrees that, from time to
time after the Closing Date, it will execute and deliver or cause its
respective Affiliates and, in the case of the Company, the Founders and their
respective Affiliates, to execute and deliver such further instruments, and
take (or cause their respective Affiliates to take) such other action, as may
be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of this
Agreement.

 

8.4 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Buyer shall be responsible for and shall pay all Transfer Taxes, and
Buyer shall prepare and file all necessary Tax Returns and other required
documentation relating to such Transfer Taxes in accordance with applicable
Law. To the extent reasonably requested by Buyer, each other party to this
Agreement shall cooperate in the filing and join in the execution of any such
Tax Returns and other required documentation.

(b) After the Closing, Buyer shall provide to the Company Members (or
cause the Company Members to be provided) with reasonable access to all
relevant documents, data and other information, properties, books, records and
employees to the extent reasonably necessary for the purpose of preparing Tax
Returns, filing refund claims, responding to any audit by any taxing
jurisdiction or replying to any third party or Governmental Authority claim or
demand concerning the Surviving Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
predecessors. Buyer and the Company Members shall cooperate with all
reasonable requests of the Company Members or

 



49  Buyer made in connection with any Tax matters relating to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and such cooperation shall include the retention of and
(upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information
reasonably relevant to any such matters and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder.

 

(c) The Surviving Company shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared
and filed) all Pass-Through Tax Returns that are required to be filed (taking
into account extensions of time to file) after the Closing Date by or with
respect to the Company for any taxable period (or portions thereof) ending on
or before the Closing Date. Any Tax deductions in respect of the UAR Payment
Amount, any Closing Transaction Expenses (including any amounts described in
the definition of Closing Transaction Expenses that were paid prior to, on or
after the Closing Date) and any fees, expenses, premiums and penalties paid
or payable with respect to the prepayment of Funded Debt contemplated by this
Agreement and the write-off or acceleration of the amortization of deferred
financing costs, in each case, shall be taken into account in the Pass-
Through Tax Returns described in this Section 8.4(c) that relate to any
taxable period (or portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date to
the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law. The Surviving Company shall
retain Grant Thornton for the preparation of all Pass-Through Tax Returns
prepared pursuant to this _Section 8.4(c)_, and any reasonable costs and
expenses with respect to the preparation and filing of such Pass-Through Tax
Returns shall be borne by the Holder Representative (on behalf of the Company
Members). The Surviving Company shall deliver to the Holder Representative
copies of each such Pass-Through Tax Return at least twenty (20) days prior to
the due date (taking into account extensions of time to file) for filing such
Pass-Through Tax Return and shall permit MI Procurement, in its capacity,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, as the Companys Tax Matters Partner,
to review, comment on and approve such Tax Returns. The Surviving Company
shall make all reasonable comments requested by MI Procurement and no Tax
Returns prepared pursuant to this _Section 8.4(c)_ shall be filed without the
prior approval of MI Procurement (not to be unreasonably withheld). The
Holder Representative shall reasonably cooperate with the Surviving Company in
connection with the filing of such Tax Returns.

 

(d) The Surviving Company shall prepare and timely file (or cause to be
timely filed) all Tax Returns (other than Pass-Through Tax Returns described
in _Section 8.4(c)_) that relate to tax periods ending on or before the
Closing Date or relate to Straddle Periods that, in either case, are required
to be filed after the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practice of the Company except as required by Law.
To the extent any such Tax Return impacts a Pass-Through Tax Return or any
Taxes for which any Company Member is liable, the Surviving Company shall
deliver to the Company Members copies of each such Tax Return at least twenty
(20) days (or, for non-income Tax Returns, such shorter period as is
reasonable, taking into account the relevant Tax Return and Tax period) prior
to the due date (taking into account extensions of time to file) for filing
such Tax Return and shall permit the Holder Representative to review and
comment on such Tax Return and the Surviving Company shall incorporate any
reasonable comments the Holder Representative timely submits to the Surviving
Company.

(e) Except with the express written consent of the Holder Representative,
which consent may be withheld in the Holder Representatives sole and absolute
discretion, neither

 



50  Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (i) take any action on the Closing Date after the Closing
other than in the ordinary course of business; (ii) amend any Tax Return with
respect to a taxable period (or portion thereof) that ends on or before, or
includes, the Closing Date, unless such amendment is made pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code (or any
similar concept under state, local or non-U.S. Law); (iii) make, change or
revoke any Tax election with respect to a taxable period (or portion thereof)
that ends on or before, or includes, the Closing Date; (iv) make any election
under Sections 338 or 336 of the Code or any similar provision of state, local
or other Tax Law or (v) initiate contact with any Governmental Authority
(other than by filing a Tax Return in accordance with _Section 8.4(c)_) with
respect to a tax period ending on or before the Closing Date, in each case, to
the extent such actions relate to a Pass-Through Tax Return, could have a
material adverse impact on a Pass-Through Tax Return, or could increase the
Taxes of any Pre-Closing Holder or the Tax liabilities included in Net Working
Capital.

 

(f) Buyer, the Surviving Company and their Subsidiaries shall promptly
notify the Holder Representative upon receipt by such party of written notice
of any inquiries, claims, assessments, legal proceedings, audits or similar
events with respect to any Pass-Through Tax Return (or the Taxes relating to
any Pass-Through Tax Return) for a tax period ending on or before the Closing
Date or any Straddle Period (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, legal
proceeding, audit or similar event, a " _Pass-Through Tax Matter_ "). The
Holder Representative shall have sole control of the conduct of all Pass-
Through Tax Matters relating to a tax period ending on or before the Closing
Date, including any settlement or compromise thereof and, if the Closing Date
occurs after December 31, 2017 and the IRS does not make the determination (in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) that the Company has
ceased to exist in accordance with Proposed Treasury Regulation Section
301.6241-3(b), shall take all actions necessary to cause an election under
Section 6226 of the Code (or any similar provisions of state, local or
non-U.S. Law) to be made with respect to any adjustment to which the
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (or any similar provisions of state, local or
non-U.S. Law) would apply. The Holder Representative shall not make any
election to have the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (or any similar provisions
of state, local or non-U.S. Law) apply to the Company for any taxable period
beginning before January 1, 2018. The Holder Representative shall be entitled
to participate in any Pass-Through Tax Matter relating to any Straddle Period
and Buyer and the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall not settle or
otherwise resolve any such Pass-Through Tax Matter without the Holder
Representatives prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).

 

(g) At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a
certificate prepared in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.144511T(d)(2) certifying that as of the Closing, fifty percent (50%) or
more of the value of the gross assets of the Company does not consist of U.S.
real property interests or ninety percent (90%) or more of the value of the
gross assets of the Company does not consist of U.S. real property interests
plus cash or cash equivalents.

 

(h) Buyer, the Company Members and the Company and the Surviving Company
agree that, pursuant to Situation 2 of Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432,
the purchase and sale of the Company Ownership Interests shall be treated for
U.S. federal income tax and other applicable Tax purposes as (i) a sale or
exchange of partnership interests under Section 741 of

 



51  the Code with respect to the Company Members and (ii) a purchase of all of
the assets of the Company with respect to Buyer. The acquisition of the
Company Ownership Interests by Buyer shall result in a termination of the
Company pursuant to Section 708(b)(1)(A) of the Code, thereby causing the
Companys taxable year for U.S. federal income Tax and other applicable Tax
purposes to close as of the Closing Date. The parties hereto agree that any
amounts properly treated as consideration for the Company Ownership Interests
for U.S. federal tax purposes shall be allocated among the assets of the
Company. Such allocation shall be made in accordance with the requirements of
Code Sections 1060 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the " _Allocation_
"). No later than ninety (90) days after the Closing, the Surviving Company
shall prepare and deliver to Buyer and the Holder Representative for
its review and comment, a draft of the Allocation. The Holder Representative
and Buyer shall work in good faith to resolve any disputes relating to the
Allocation. If the Holder Representative and Buyer are unable to resolve any
such dispute within sixty (60) days of delivery then Buyer on the one hand
and the Company Members on the other shall be entitled to adopt their own
position regarding the Purchase Price Allocation. Nothing herein shall prevent
Buyer, the Surviving Company or any Company Member from settling any proposed
deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority based upon or arising
out of the Allocation and no party shall be required to litigate before any
court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority
challenging the Allocation.

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, the determination of the Taxes for the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by
assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable periods, one that
ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other that began at the
beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain,
deduction, loss or credit and state and local apportionment factors of the
Company for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable
periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books and
records of the Company were closed at the closing of the Closing Date;
provided, however, that (i) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis, such as depreciation, and (ii) periodic Taxes,
such as property or similar ad valorem Taxes, shall be apportioned ratably
between such periods on the basis of the number of days elapsed in each such
period.

8.5 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Subject to the right of Buyer to consummate a Replacement Financing, or
another financing contemplated by  _Section 8.5(c), _Buyer shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Commitment Letters as promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with and
maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letters, negotiate and enter into
definitive financing agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (the "
_Financing Agreements_ ") (and comply with and maintain in effect
the Financing Agreements after the same become effective), (ii) satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letters and the Financing Agreements relating to the Debt
Financing, and (iii) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Closing. Buyer

 



52  shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights under the Debt
Commitment Letters in the event of a breach by the Debt Financing Sources.
Buyer shall not amend, modify or agree to any waiver under the Debt
Commitment Letters or its Existing Credit Agreement (as defined in the Debt
Commitment Letters), without the prior written approval of the Company, if
such amendment, modification, or waiver would, or would reasonably
be expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing from
that contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters in any manner that would
adversely impact the ability to pay the Merger Consideration on the Closing
Date, (ii) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or
modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner
materially adverse to Buyer, (iii) materially delay (taking into account the
proviso in  _Section 2.3_) or prevent the Closing, (iv) make the funding of
the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing) less likely to occur or (v) adversely impact (A) the ability of
Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated at the Closing, (B) the likelihood of the consummation of such
transactions to be consummated at the Closing or (C) the ability of Buyer to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letters
or the Financing Agreements (it being understood that the Debt Commitment
Letters may be amended to include additional lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed
the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof if the addition of such
additional parties, individually or in the aggregate, would not prevent, delay
or impair the availability of the Debt Financing or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby). For purposes of this Agreement, references
to "Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters as permitted to be amended or modified by this  _Section
8.5_ and references to "Debt Commitment Letters" shall include such documents
as permitted to be amended or modified by this _Section 8.5_.

 

(b) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, or if
Buyer believes that the Debt Financing is reasonably likely to become
unavailable, on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters, Buyer shall (i) notify the Company, (ii) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources on terms and conditions that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, to Buyer than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters and in
amounts sufficient to enable Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") and (iii) obtain a new
financing commitment letter (the " _Alternative Financing Commitment Letter_
") that provides for such Alternative Financing and, within a reasonable time
after execution thereof, deliver to the Company true, complete and correct
copies of the new commitment letter and the fee letter related thereto (in a
redacted form removing only the fees, pricing caps, economic terms and
"market flex" provisions, which redacted information does not relate to the
amounts, termination or conditionality of, or contain any conditions precedent
to, the funding of the Debt Financing). For purposes of this Agreement,
references to "Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by
the Alternative Commitment Letter (if any) and references to "Debt Commitment
Letters" shall include the Alternative Financing Commitment Letter (if any),
as such document is permitted to be amended or modified by this _Section
8.5_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) Buyer
shall have the right to enter into one or more long-term debt financings that
replace all or a portion of the Debt Financing and/or substitute the proceeds
of consummated equity offerings or debt offerings 

 



53  or other incurrences of debt for all or any portion of the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and (ii) Buyer may reduce
commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter in connection therewith;
_provided_ , in the case of this clause (ii), that (A) to the extent any such
equity or debt has a scheduled special or mandatory redemption right, such
right is not exercisable prior to the earliest of the consummation of the
Merger on the Closing Date, the termination of this Agreement and the
Termination Date and (B) any conditions to the use of such proceeds of such
offering or other debt financing to pay the Merger Consideration when due
are no more restrictive, taken as a whole, than the conditions set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter (any such debt financing, a " _Replacement
Financing_ ", and collectively, the " _Replacement Financings_ "). For
purposes of this Agreement, references to "Debt Financing" shall include any
Replacement Financing and references to "Debt Commitment Letters" and
"Financing Agreements" shall include any related commitment letters,
engagement letters and other definitive agreements with respect to each
Replacement Financing.

(d) Buyer shall (i) give the Company prompt written notice of any material
default, breach or threatened material default or breach (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material default or breach) by any
party to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements of
which Buyer or its respective Representatives becomes aware or any withdrawal,
termination, repudiation or rescission or threatened withdrawal, termination,
repudiation or rescission thereof of which Buyer or its respective
Representatives becomes aware, and (ii) otherwise keep the Company, upon its
request, reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall
give the Company prompt notice (A) of the receipt or delivery of any written
notice or other written communication, in each case from any Person with
respect to (x) any actual or potential default under or breach of any
provisions of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements by Buyer, or
any withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission or threatened
withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission thereof by any party to
any of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements or (y) any dispute
or disagreement between or among parties to any of the Debt Commitment Letters
or Financing Agreements with respect to the obligation to fund the Debt
Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at the Closing, and
(B) if at any time for any reason Buyer believes that it will not be able to
obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions,
in the manner or from the sources, contemplated by any of the Debt Commitment
Letters. Buyer shall promptly provide any information reasonably requested by
the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (A) or (B) of
the immediately preceding sentence.

(e) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 8.5_ and the Debt
Financing Sources or other prospective lenders being subject to obligations of
confidentiality on customary terms, prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide, and the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective Representatives to, at the sole expense of Buyer, provide, to
Buyer and its Affiliates all customary cooperation that may be reasonably
requested by Buyer (including reasonable requests of banks, initial
purchasers, underwriters or other Debt Financing Sources or their counsel) to
assist Buyer and its Affiliates in the arrangement and consummation of the
Debt Financing (including (i) providing the Required Information and using
reasonable best efforts to furnish Buyer and the Debt Financing Sources as
promptly as practicable with such other

 



54  financial and pertinent information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and assets as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer and its Debt Financing Sources, including, in any event,
such financial information as is required pursuant to the Debt Commitment
Letters, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to assist with preparation and
execution of any definitive guarantee and collateral documents (including
schedules thereto) reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of the Debt
Financing and otherwise reasonably facilitating the provision of collateral to
the extent required by the terms of the Debt Financing, (iii)
cooperating reasonably with the Debt Financing Sources due diligence, to the
extent customary, in connection with the Debt Financing, (iv) using reasonable
best efforts to participate (and causing senior management to participate) in
due diligence sessions to the extent reasonably required by Buyer and its
Debt Financing Sources, (v) causing the Companys auditors to deliver
customary consents and comfort letters (including "negative assurance"
comfort) with respect to financing information relating to the Company and
its Subsidiaries as reasonably requested by the Buyer as necessary or
customary for financings similar to the Debt Financing and to attend
accounting due diligence sessions and (vi) at least four (4) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, providing all documentation and other information
about the Company that is reasonably requested by the Debt Financing Sources
and is required by applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act, to the extent requested
by Buyer in writing at least eight (8) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date).

 

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be required to
provide, or to cause its Subsidiaries or its or their respective
Representatives to provide, cooperation under this _Section 8.5_ that
unreasonably interferes with the ongoing business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Nothing in this _Section 8.5_ shall require the Company or its
Subsidiaries to (i) bear any out-of-pocket cost or expense for which it has
not received prior reimbursement pursuant to _Section 8.5(g)_ or pay any fee
in connection with the Debt Financing, (ii) incur any liability in connection
with the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time, (iii) enter into any
binding agreement that would be effective prior to the Effective Time and
that does not terminate without liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries
upon termination of this Agreement, (iv) require cooperation to the extent
that it would (x) cause any condition to the Closing set forth in Article IX
to not be satisfied or cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement
to be breached, (y) reasonably be expected to conflict with or violate any
applicable Law or (z) cause the Company and/or its Subsidiaries to violate any
obligation of confidentiality (not created in contemplation hereof) binding
on the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, (v) take any action that would (A)
cause any natural person serving as a director, manager, partner, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any
personal liability or (B) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
provide access to, or disclose, information that reasonably would be expected
to result in the waiver of any attorney-client, work product or other
applicable privilege or protection or (vi) require the managers or directors
of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, acting in such capacity, to authorize
or adopt any resolutions approving the agreements, documents, instruments,
actions and transactions contemplated in connection with the Debt Financing
prior to the Effective Time.

 

(g) Buyer shall, promptly upon written request by the Company, (i)
reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives in connection with 

 



55  their respective obligations under this _Section 8.5_ and (ii) indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law from and
against any and all liability suffered, sustained or incurred by, or asserted
against, any of them, directly or indirectly relating to, or arising out of,
this _Section 8.5_, the arrangement of the Debt Financing or providing any
of the information utilized in connection therewith, whether in respect of
direct claims, third-party claims or otherwise, other than to the extent any
of the foregoing arises from (A) the willful breach of the obligations of the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives under this
_Section 8.5_ or any fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful
misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of the Company, its Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives or (B) material misstatements or omissions in
information provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives in connection with the Debt Financing. The
foregoing obligations in this Section 8.5(g) shall survive the Closing or, if
earlier, the termination of this Agreement.

 

(h) Each of Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining
of any Debt Financing, or entering into or consummating any Financing
Agreement, is not a condition to Closing and reaffirms its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and
independently of the availability of any Debt Financing, subject
to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Sections 9.1_ and
_9.2_.

merger, business combination, purchase or disposition of Company Ownership
Interests or other Equity Interests in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (any such transaction, an " _Acquisition Transaction_ "),
in each case however structured, other than pursuant to this Agreement. The
Company shall, and shall instruct the Founders and its and their Affiliates
and cause its Representatives to, (i) immediately cease any discussions or
negotiations of the nature described in the foregoing sentence, if any, (ii)
promptly request in writing that all prospective acquirers of the Company to
whom nonpublic information concerning the Company has been distributed on or
prior to the date hereof in connection with the current process relating to
the sale of the Company (other than Buyer, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives) return such information to the Company (or destroy such
information) as soon as possible, and (iii)  refrain from entering into any
agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to any Acquisition
Transaction.

 8.7 _HSR Act and Foreign Antitrust Approvals_.

(a) In connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Company shall (and, to the extent required, shall cause its Affiliates
to), (a) promptly but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the
date hereof, comply with the notification and 

 



56  reporting requirements of the HSR Act and (b) as soon as reasonably
practicable, make such other filings with any similar foreign Governmental
Authorities as may be required under any applicable similar foreign Law, to
the extent set forth on _Schedule 8.7(a)_. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain early termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act and (ii) comply with any Antitrust Information or Document
Requests as soon as reasonably practicable and advisable.

(b) In connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Buyer shall (and, to the extent required, shall cause its Affiliates to) (i)
comply promptly but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the
date hereof with the notification and reporting requirements of the HSR Act
and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting

other filings with any foreign Governmental Authorities as may be required
under any applicable similar foreign Law, to the extent set forth on _Schedule
8.7(b)_. Buyer shall comply with any Antitrust Information or Document
Requests as soon as reasonably practicable and advisable.

 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable under Law to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, (i) use reasonable best efforts to comply as soon as reasonable
and practicable with any Antitrust Information or Document Requests and (ii)
cooperate with the Company in connection with any filing and in connection
with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any Governmental
Authority. Each of Buyer and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to furnish to the other party all information required for any application or
other filing to be made pursuant to any Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, to the extent
permitted by Law, responding to any reasonable requests for copies of
documents filed with Buyers prior filings). Each of Buyer and the Company
shall promptly inform the other party of any substantive oral communication
with, and provide copies of written communications with, any Governmental
Authority regarding any such filings or any such transaction; _provided_ ,
however, that to the extent any of the documents or information are
commercially or competitively sensitive, the Company or Buyer, as the case may
be, may satisfy its obligations by providing such documents or information to
the other partys outside counsel, with the understanding and agreement that
such counsel shall not share such documents and information with its client;
provided, further, that any such materials may also be redacted (x) to remove
references concerning valuations, (y) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and (z) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or
confidentiality concerns. Neither Buyer nor the Company shall
independently participate in any substantive meeting with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other inquiry
without giving the Company prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent
practicable and permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to
attend and/or participate. Subject to applicable Law, each of Buyer and the
Company will consult and cooperate with the other party in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of such party relating to
proceedings under the HSR Act and any similar foreign Law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to the
matters covered in this _Section 8.7(c)_, it is agreed that Buyer and the
Company shall cooperate with one another in preparing for and participating

 



57  in all meetings and communications with any Governmental Authority, provided
that Buyer shall take the lead in all meetings and communications with any
Governmental Authority, including by determining the appropriate timing of
any such meeting or communications (including the timing of the submission of
any filing with, or response to any request by, a Governmental Authority) or
any action taken pursuant to this  _Section 8.7(c)_.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the actions and obligations
described in  _Section 8.7(c)_, Buyer and the Company shall use their
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted
by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under the HSR Act and any similar foreign Law. In connection
therewith, if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as in violation of
the HSR Act or any similar foreign Law, Buyer and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such Action, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents, limits or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by pursuing all
available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal, unless, by mutual
agreement, Buyer and the Company decide that litigation is not in their
respective best interests.

(e) Buyer further agrees that it shall, to the extent necessary to obtain
the waiver or consent from any Governmental Authority required to satisfy the
conditions set forth in _Section 9.1(a)_ or _Section 9.1(b)_, as applicable,
or to avoid the entry of or have lifted, vacated or terminated any Law
enacted, entered, promulgated, enforced or issued by any Governmental
Authority restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take the following actions: (i)
propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted,
commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise,
and in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or
businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and/or any assets or
businesses of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (or equity interests held by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates in entities with assets or businesses); (ii)
agree to terminate any of Buyers, the Companys, or any of their respective
Affiliates existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations;
(iii) otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any action which it
is capable of taking and, if the offer is accepted, take or commit to take
such action, that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability
to retain, any of the assets or businesses of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and/or any assets or businesses of Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(or equity interests held by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in entities with
assets or businesses); and (iv) take promptly, in the event that any
permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unlawful or
that would prevent or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, any and all steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting
of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) of this  _Section 8.7(e)_) necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such
injunction or order. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyers
obligations under this _Section 8.7_ shall be absolute and not qualified
by "commercially reasonable efforts."

 



58 (f) Buyer shall be solely responsible for and pay all filing fees
payable to the Antitrust Authorities in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE X.

10.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby abandoned:

(a) by written consent of the Company and Buyer;

 



60 (b) prior to the Closing, by written notice to the Company from Buyer if: 

(i) there is any material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement (provided
that the occurrence of a Marketing Period Triggering Event shall not
constitute a breach by the Company of this Agreement for any purpose hereof),
such that the conditions specified in  _Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.2(b)_
would not be satisfied at the Closing (a " _Terminating Company Breach_ "),
except that, if such Terminating Company Breach is curable by the Company
through the exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then, for a period of
time until the earlier of (x) thirty (30) days after receipt by the Company of
notice from Buyer of such breach and (y) the Closing Date, but, in each case,
only as long as the Company continues to use its reasonable best efforts to

termination shall not be effective, and such termination shall become
effective only if the Terminating Company Breach is not cured within the
Company Cure Period;

(ii) the Closing has not occurred on or before January 13, 2018 (subject
to (A) _Section 11.15_ and (B) the proviso to this clause (ii), the "
_Termination Date_ "), unless Buyers or Merger Subs breach is the primary
reason for the Closing not occurring on or before such date, provided,
however, that if the conditions set forth in _Section 9.1(a)_ or _9.1(b)_
(or, with respect to matters addressed in such Sections, _Section 9.1(c)_)
have not been satisfied or waived on or prior to such date, but all other
conditions set forth in _Article IX_ have been satisfied or waived (except for
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but

then the Termination Date may be extended by Buyer or the Company in writing
to a date not beyond April 13, 2018;

p.m. ET on the first Business Day after the date of this Agreement, for so
long as the Merger Consent has not been delivered to Buyer; or

(c) prior to the Closing, by written notice to Buyer from the Company if:

(i) (A) there is any material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer or Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement, such that the conditions specified in _Section 9.3(a)_ or _Section
9.3(b)_ would not be satisfied at the Closing (a " _Terminating Buyer Breach_
"), except that, if such Terminating Buyer Breach is curable by Buyer through
the exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then, for a period of time until
the earlier of (x) thirty (30) days after receipt by Buyer of notice from the
Company of such breach and (y) the Closing Date, but, in each case, only as
long as Buyer continues to use its reasonable best efforts to cure such
Terminating Buyer Breach (the " _Buyer Cure Period_ "), such termination
shall not be effective, and such termination shall become effective only if
the Terminating Buyer Breach is not cured within the Buyer Cure Period or (B)
(1) all of the conditions set forth in  _Section 9.1_ and 9.2 have been
satisfied (other than those conditions which by their terms or nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing) as of the date the Closing should have occurred
pursuant 

 



61  to _Section 2.3_, and (2) Buyer or Merger Sub has failed to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement within one (1) Business Day
following the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section
2.3_;

(ii) the Closing has not occurred on or before the Termination Date (as
may be extended by Buyer or the Company pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)(ii)_),
unless the Companys breach is the primary reason for the Closing not
occurring on or before such date (provided that the occurrence of a Marketing
Period Triggering Event shall not constitute a breach by the Company of this
Agreement for any purpose hereof); or

 

(iii) the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby is
permanently enjoined, prohibited or otherwise restrained by the terms of a
final, non-appealable order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

 

10.2 _Effect of Termination_. Except as otherwise set forth in this 
_Section 10.2_, in the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 10.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no
effect, without any liability on the part of any party hereto or its
respective Affiliates, officers, directors, managers, stockholders or
members, other than liability of the Company, Buyer or Merger Sub, as the case
may be, for any Fraud or intentional and willful breach of this Agreement
occurring prior to such termination;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, a
failure of Buyer or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger in breach of this
Agreement shall be deemed to be intentional and willful whether or not Buyer
and Merger Sub had sufficient funds available to consummate the Merger. In
determining losses or damages recoverable upon termination by a party hereto
for the other partys breach, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
such losses and damages shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or
out-of-pocket costs, and shall include the benefit of the bargain lost by such
party or, in the case of the Company, holders of Company Ownership
Interests and Unit Appreciation Rights (taking into consideration relevant
matters, including other opportunities and the time value of money), which
shall be deemed to be damages payable to such party. The provisions of
_Sections 10.2_ , _11.4_ ,  _11.5_ , _11.6_ , _11.7_ , _11.10_ , _11.11_ ,
_11.12_ , _11.13_ , _11.14_ , _11.15_ , _11.16_ and _11.19_ , and the
Confidentiality Agreement, shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE XI.

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 11.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. None of
the representations or warranties or (other than _Article II_ , _Article III_
and _Article XI_ and _Sections 7.1_ , _7.2_ , _7.3_ , _8.3_ , _8.4_ and
8.5(g)) the covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or in any
certificate delivered by any of the parties hereto at the Closing, shall
survive the Effective Time. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer and Merger
Sub hereby waive, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may
have against the Company or any of the persons described in the last sentence
of _Section 11.16_ (with respect to the Company) relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement based upon predecessor or successor liability,
contribution, tort, strict liability or any Law or otherwise, except in the
case of Fraud. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

 



62 (a) Buyer and Merger Sub hereby waive any statutory and common
law remedies, including remedies that may be available under Environmental
Laws, with respect to matters relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including with respect to any environmental, health or safety
matters), except in the case of Fraud;

(b) after the Closing Date, none of Buyer, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates may seek the rescission of the transactions contemplated by this

liabilities and obligations respecting the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and
provisions of this Agreement;

 

(e) the parties hereto hereby agree that no party hereto shall have any
remedies or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort) for any
statements, communications, disclosures, failures to disclose, representations
or warranties not set forth in this Agreement; and

 

(f) the parties hereto each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies
the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from
arms-length negotiations and the parties hereto specifically acknowledge that
no party hereto has any special relationship with another party hereto that
would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an
ordinary seller in an arms-length transaction.

 

11.2 _Waiver_. Any party to this Agreement may, at any time prior to the
Closing, waive any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement or (without
limiting _Section 11.11_ and _Section 11.19_) agree to an amendment or
modification to this Agreement by an agreement in writing executed in the same
manner (but not necessarily by the same Persons) as this Agreement. No waiver
by any of the parties hereto of any default, misrepresentation or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to
extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. No waiver by any of the
parties of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly
set forth in writing and executed by the party sought to be charged with such
waiver.

 11.3 _Notices_. All notices and other communications among the parties
shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (i) when
delivered in person, (ii) five Business Days following the date of posting in

contemplated hereby, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles or
rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would
require or permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction.

 11.8 _Captions; Counterparts_. The captions in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.
This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument.

 

11.9 _Schedules and Annexes_. The Schedules and Annexes referenced herein
are a part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein. All references
herein to Schedules and Annexes shall be deemed references to such parts of
this Agreement, unless the context shall otherwise require. Any disclosure
made by a party in the Schedules with reference to any section or schedule of
this Agreement shall be deemed to be a disclosure with respect to all other
sections or schedules to which the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure. Certain information set forth in the
Schedules is included solely for informational purposes and may not be
required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. The disclosure of any
information shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that such

and warranties made in this Agreement, nor shall such information be deemed to
establish a standard of materiality.

 

11.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Schedules and
Annexes to this Agreement), the Escrow Agreement, the Founder Commercial
Agreements and that certain Confidentiality Agreement dated as of July 12,
2017 between Buyer and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ")
constitute the entire agreement among the parties relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby and supersede any other agreements, whether
written or oral, that may have been made or entered into by or among any of
the parties hereto or any of their respective Subsidiaries relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby. No representations, warranties, covenants,
understandings, agreements, oral or otherwise, relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement exist between the parties except as expressly
set forth in this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



67 11.11 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or
in part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed in the same
manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement. The
approval of this Agreement by the Company Members shall not restrict the
ability of the Board of Managers of the Company to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 10.1_ or to cause the Company to enter into an
amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.11_ to the extent
permitted under the Act.

11.12 _Publicity_. The Company and Buyer agree that, from the date hereof
through the Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued or made by or on behalf of
any party without the prior consent of the other parties, except as required
by applicable Law or by a request from a Governmental Authority or except that
each of Buyer, the Company and their Subsidiaries, and each of the Company
Members, may make announcements from time to time to their respective
employees, customers, suppliers and other business relations, including hotel
owners and franchisees, and otherwise as Buyer, the Company or such Company
Member, as applicable, may reasonably determine is necessary to comply with
applicable Law, a request from a Governmental Authority, or the requirements
of any agreement to which Buyer, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries, or
such Company Member or any of its Affiliates, as applicable, is a party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and the Company shall cooperate to
prepare a joint press release to be issued on or promptly (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days) after the date of this Agreement and a joint
press release to be issued on the Closing Date. The Company and Buyer
and Merger Sub agree to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential, except
to the extent and to the Persons to whom disclosure is required by applicable
Law, upon a request from a Governmental Authority, or for purposes of
compliance with financial reporting obligations; provided, that the parties
may disclose such terms to their respective employees, accountants, advisors
and other Representatives as necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct
of their respective businesses (so long as such Persons agree to, or are
bound by contract or professional or fiduciary obligations to, keep the terms
of this Agreement confidential and so long as the parties shall be responsible
to the other parties hereto for breach of this  _Section 11.12_ or such
confidentiality obligations by the recipients of its disclosure); _provided_ ,
_further_ , the Company may disclose such terms to its members and financing
sources and Buyer may disclose such terms to the Debt Financing Sources.

11.13 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid
or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions
of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The parties further
agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid
or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement, they
shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of this
Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law and, to
the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to
replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid or unenforceable
with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the intent of the
parties.

 

11.14 _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) ANY PROCEEDING OR ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE
DELAWARE CHANCERY COURT (OR, IF THE

 



68  DELAWARE CHANCERY COURT SHALL BE UNAVAILABLE, ANY OTHER COURT OF THE STATE
OF DELAWARE OR, IN THE CASE OF CLAIMS TO WHICH THE FEDERAL COURTS HAVE
EXCLUSIVE SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION, ANY FEDERAL COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA SITTING IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE), AND EACH OF THE PARTIES
IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF EACH SUCH COURT IN ANY
SUCH PROCEEDING OR ACTION, WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE
TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION, VENUE OR TO CONVENIENCE OF FORUM, AGREES THAT ALL
CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF THE PROCEEDING OR ACTION SHALL BE HEARD AND DETERMINED
ONLY IN ANY SUCH COURT, AND AGREES NOT TO BRING ANY PROCEEDING OR ACTION
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY IN ANY OTHER COURT. NOTHING HEREIN CONTAINED SHALL BE DEEMED TO AFFECT
THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO
COMMENCE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE PROCEED AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY IN
ANY OTHER JURISDICTION, IN EACH CASE, TO ENFORCE JUDGMENTS OBTAINED IN ANY
ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT PURSUANT TO THIS _SECTION 11.14(a)_.

 

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT
FINANCING OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY
HERETO (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 11.14(b)_.

 11.15 _Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur, and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law,
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages
or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled
at law or in equity. Each party agrees to waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. The parties
further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. To
the extent any party hereto brings an action, suit or proceeding to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
(other than an action to enforce specifically any provision that
expressly survives termination of this Agreement), the Termination Date shall
automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following
the resolution of such action, suit or proceeding or (ii) such other time
period established by the court presiding over such action, suit or
proceeding.

 



69 11.16 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against,
the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with
respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such
party. Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then only to
the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party in this
Agreement and not otherwise), no past, present or future director, manager,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate or
agent, attorney, advisor or representative of any such Person or any of its
Affiliates shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise), obligation or commitment hereunder or for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more of the Company, Buyer or Merger Sub under this
Agreement (whether for indemnification or otherwise) of or for any claim based
on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

11.17 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representations;  Non-Assertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege_.

(a) _Conflicts of Interest_. Each of Buyer and the Company hereby waives
and shall not assert, and agrees after the Closing to cause any other
applicable Subsidiaries of Buyer (including the Surviving Company) to waive
and to not assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the
representation, after the Closing (the " _Post-Closing Representation_ "), of
the Founders, one or more other Pre-Closing Holders (including the
Holder Representative), or any of their respective officers, employees,
directors or managers (any such person, a " _Designated Person_ ") in any
matter involving this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions
contemplated hereby, by any legal counsel (" _Prior Company Counsel_ ")
currently representing the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Designated Person
in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of
this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby
(the " _Current Representation_ "). Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer and
the Company agree that, following the Closing, Prior Company Counsel may serve
as counsel to any Designated Person in connection with any matters related to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding any
representation by Prior Company Counsel prior to the Closing, and Buyer and
the Company (on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries) hereby agree that, in
the event that a dispute arises after the Closing out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement between
Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, on the one hand, and any
Designated Person, on the other hand, Prior Company Counsel may represent one
or more Designated Persons in such dispute even though the interests of such
Person(s) may be directly adverse to Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiaries
and even though Prior Company Counsel may have represented the Company or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing in a matter substantially related to such
dispute.

(b) _Attorney-Client Privilege_. Buyer waives and shall not assert, and
agrees after the Closing to cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries
to waive and to not assert, any

 



70  attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication between any
Prior Company Counsel and the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Designated
Person occurring during the Current Representation in connection with any
Post-Closing Representation, including in connection with a dispute between
any Designated Person and one or more of Buyer, the Company and their
respective Affiliates, it being the intention of the parties hereto that all
rights to such attorney-client privilege and to control such attorney-client
privilege shall be retained by the Founders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that a dispute arises between Buyer, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries and a third party other than a
party to this Agreement after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation may
assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by any Prior Company Counsel to such third party; provided,
however, that the Surviving Corporation may not have access to such
confidential communications or waive such privilege without the prior written
consent of a majority of the Founders. Furthermore, Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that any advice given to or communication with any of the Designated
Persons (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall not be subject to
any joint privilege (whether or not the Company or one more of
its Subsidiaries also received such advice or communication) and shall be
owned solely by such Designated Persons (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries). All books and records of the Company containing any such
privileged communications shall be excluded from the purchase, and shall be
distributed to the Founders (on behalf of the applicable Designated Persons)
immediately prior to the Closing with no copies retained by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. Buyer hereby acknowledges that it has had the
opportunity (including on behalf of its Affiliates and the Company) to discuss
and obtain adequate information concerning the significance and material risks
of, and reasonable available alternatives to, the waivers, permissions
and other provisions of this Agreement, including the opportunity to consult
with counsel other than Prior Company Counsel. This _Section 11.17_ shall be
irrevocable, and no term of this _Section 11.17_ may be amended, waived
or modified, without the prior written consent of the Founders and Prior
Company Counsel affected thereby.

 

11.18 _Holder Representative_.

 

(a) Except with respect to any applicable Founder Commercial Agreement,
the Pre-Closing Holders, by approving this Agreement (whether by vote, by
execution of a Letter of Transmittal or by receipt of any Closing Date Company
Unit Consideration), agree that the Holder Representative is hereby
irrevocably appointed as the representative, agent, proxy, and attorney-in-
fact for all Pre-Closing Holders for all purposes under this Agreement, and
shall have the full power and authority on the Pre-Closing Holders behalf:
(i) to consummate the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the
other agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed
in connection herewith, (ii) to negotiate and settle disputes arising under,
or relating to, this Agreement and the other agreements, instruments, and
documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith, (iii) to
receive and disburse to the Pre-Closing Holders and the Company (on behalf of
the Pre-Closing Holders) any funds received on behalf of the Pre-Closing
Holders under this Agreement or otherwise, (iv) to withhold any amounts
received on behalf of the Pre-Closing Holders pursuant to this Agreement,
including the Holder Representative Holdback Amount, or otherwise to satisfy
any and all obligations or liabilities incurred by the Pre-Closing Holders or
the Holder Representative in the performance of their duties hereunder, (v)
to direct the distribution of funds (including the Escrow Amount, the Holder
Representative Holdback Amount and by preparing the Updated

 



71  Distribution Waterfall) and make or direct payments of funds from the Holder
Representative Holdback Amount and to give receipts for funds, (vi) to execute
and deliver any amendment or waiver to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
and the other agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or
executed in connection herewith (without the prior approval of the Pre-
Closing Holders) and (vii) to take all other actions to be taken by or on
behalf of the Pre-Closing Holders in connection with this Agreement and the
other agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed
in connection herewith. The Pre-Closing Holders, by approving this Agreement
(whether by vote, by execution of a Letter of Transmittal or by receipt of any
Closing Date Company Unit Consideration), further agree that such agency and
proxy are coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable without the
consent of the Holder Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity,
bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Pre-Closing Holder. Except with
respect to any applicable Founder Commercial Agreement, all decisions and
actions by the Holder Representative shall be binding upon all of the Pre-
Closing Holders and no Pre-Closing Holder shall have the right to object to,
dissent from, protest or otherwise contest the same. Except with respect to
any applicable Founder Commercial Agreement, Buyer shall be entitled to rely
on any decision, action, consent or instruction of the Holder Representative
as being the decision, action, consent or instruction of the Pre-Closing
Holders. The Holder Representative shall not have the authority to increase
the liability of any Pre-Closing Holder on a non pro rata basis. If an
allocation is not otherwise provided for in this Agreement, the Holder
Representative shall distribute funds to the Pre-Closing Holders in accordance
with the Company LLC Agreement and the UAR Plans, provided that, to the
extent the provisions thereof conflict with this Agreement, this Agreement
shall control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event
shall the Holder Representative (A) make any modifications to the ownership
percentages of any Pre-Closing Holder with respect to Company Ownership
Interests as reflected on the Distribution Waterfall or the Updated
Distribution Waterfall without the prior written consent of all Pre-Closing
Holders who own Company Ownership Interests, or (B) execute and deliver any
amendment or waiver to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the other
agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in
connection herewith or take any other action, in each case, that would have
the effect of causing any distribution of Company Unit Consideration other
than in accordance with the applicable Per Interest Payment Amount. The
Holder Representative shall have no duties or obligations to the Pre-Closing
Holders hereunder, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, and no
implied covenants, agreements, functions, duties, responsibilities,
obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement, or shall
otherwise exist against the Holder Representative.

 

(b) By the approval of this Agreement (whether by vote, by execution of a
Letter of Transmittal or by receipt of any Closing Date Company Unit
Consideration), each Pre-Closing Holder hereby severally, for itself only and
not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Holder Representative
and its partners, managers, directors, officers, employees, shareholders,
agents and other representatives against all expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts incurred by such Persons in
connection with any action, suit or proceeding to which the Holder
Representative or such other Person is made a party by reason of the fact that
it is or was acting as the Holder Representative pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, other than as a result of the Holder Representatives bad faith or
willful misconduct.

 



72 (c) Neither the Holder Representative nor any of its
shareholders, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents or other
representatives shall incur any liability to any Pre-Closing Holder by virtue
of the failure or refusal of such Persons for any reason to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or relating to the performance of their
duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions constituting bad faith or
willful misconduct. The Holder Representative and its shareholders, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents and other representatives shall have
no liability in respect of any Action brought against such Persons by any Pre-
Closing Holder, regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or
obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort,
or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise, unless such Persons took or
omitted taking any action in bad faith or as a result of willful misconduct.

 

(d) The Holder Representative shall have the right, in its sole discretion,
to recover from any amounts withheld by the Holder Representative, including
without limitation, the Holder Representative Holdback Amount, its reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the performance of its
duties hereunder including, without limitation, those resulting from the
employment of financial advisors, attorneys, auditors and other advisors and
agents assisting in the assessment of arbitration, litigation and settlement
of any disputes arising under this Agreement (the " _Charges_ "). In the
event such amounts are insufficient to satisfy the Charges, then each Pre-
Closing Holder will be obligated to pay any remaining unpaid amounts to the
Holder Representative on a several, and not joint, basis, up to each such Pre-
Closing Holders pro rata share of proceeds received hereunder, as determined
by the Holder Representative in its discretion.

(e) In furtherance of, and without limiting any rights of the
Holder Representative set forth in, _Sections 11.18(a)(iv)_ , _11.18(a)(v)_
and _11.18(d)_ , the Holder Representative shall have the right, and the Pre-
Closing Holders hereby authorize the Holder Representative, to withhold from
the Initial Merger Consideration and the Merger Consideration the Holder
Representative Holdback Amount (in connection with the allocation and
distribution of the Initial Merger Consideration and the Merger Consideration
in accordance with _Article III_ ) to satisfy potential expenses incurred by
the Holder Representative in connection with performing its obligations under
this Agreement. The Holder Representative Holdback Amount shall be
retained by the Holder Representative until such time as the Holder
Representative shall determine, and subject to the terms hereof, the balance
of the Holder Representative Holdback Amount (the " _Holder Representative
Holdback Balance_ "), if any, shall be distributed by the Holder
Representative to the Pre-Closing Holders in accordance with their respective
entitlements as set forth in the applicable Updated Distribution Waterfall.
The Pre-Closing Holders will not receive any interest or earnings on the
Holder Representative Holdback Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to
the Holder Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have
had in any such interest or earnings. The Holder Representative will not be
liable to the Pre-Closing Holders for any loss of principal of the Holder
Representative Holdback Amount other than as a result of its gross negligence
or willful misconduct. The Holder Representative Holdback Amount shall be held
in an FDIC-insured account or accounts at a nationally recognized financial
institution.

 

(f) Following the Closing Date, a majority-in-interest of the Pre-Closing
Holders may, by written consent, appoint a new representative as the
Holder Representative for any reason or for no reason. Notice, together with
a copy of the written consent appointing such new

 



73  representative and bearing the signatures of the Pre-Closing Holders that
held at least sixty percent (60%) of the Company Ownership Interests
immediately prior to the Effective Time, must be delivered to Buyer not less
than ten (10) days prior to such appointment. Such appointment will be
effective upon the later of the date indicated in the consent or the date such
consent is received by Buyer. 

(g) In the event that the Holder Representative becomes unable or unwilling
to continue in its capacity as the Holder Representative, or if the Holder
Representative resigns as the Holder Representative, the Pre-Closing Holders
that held at least sixty percent (60%) of the Company Ownership Interests
immediately prior to the Effective Time may by written consent appoint a new
representative as the Holder Representative. Notice and a copy of the written
consent appointing such new representative and bearing the signatures of
the Pre-Closing Holders that held at least sixty percent (60%) of the Company
Ownership Interests immediately prior to the Effective Time must be delivered
to Buyer. Such appointment will be effective upon the later of the date
indicated in the consent or the date such consent is received by Buyer.

(h) Buyer and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) are entitled to deal
exclusively with the Holder Representative on all matters relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to the extent the Holder
Representative has authority to act on such matter pursuant to authority set
forth in this _Section 11.18_. Any action taken or not taken or
communications made by the Holder Representative, for or on behalf of any
Pre-Closing Holder, shall be deemed made by such Pre-Closing Holder and no
Pre-Closing Holder shall have the right to object or contest the same. Buyer
and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) shall be entitled to disregard any
communications made by any Pre-Closing Holder in connection with this
Agreement and any other agreement or document contemplated hereby and the
transactions contemplated hereby unless the same is made by the Holder
Representative (other than with respect to such Pre-Closing Holders Letter
of Transmittal). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
from and after the Closing, none of Buyer, the Company or any of its or their
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, shall be liable to any
Person, including any Pre-Closing Holder, for any action taken or not taken by
the Holder Representative or for any act or omission in reliance upon the
actions or communications of the Holder Representative, including any failure
of the Holder Representative (so long as such failure is not the result of any
act or failure to act of Buyer or Merger Sub) to distribute (or cause to be
distributed), or subdivide (or cause to be subdivided) in the correct amounts
(including by preparing the Distribution Waterfall or the Updated Distribution
Waterfall), any payments made by Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including,
after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) for
distribution to any Pre-Closing Holder or any other Person; it being
understood that once Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing,
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) has made a payment to be made
pursuant to this Agreement, in accordance with the terms hereof (including
payments in accordance with the Distribution Waterfall or the Updated
Distribution Waterfall) to any Pre-Closing Holder or such other Person, such
payment shall constitute a complete discharge of the relevant payment
obligation of Buyer or such Subsidiary.

 



74 (i) Each of the Pre-Closing Holders shall be bound by the provisions of
this _Section 11.18_ (whether by their vote or, execution of a Letter of
Transmittal or receipt of any Closing Date Company Unit Consideration) as if
they were a party hereto.

 

11.19 _Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (i) _Sections 11.2_ , _11.5_ , _11.11_ , _11.14(b)_ , _11.16_ and
_11.19_ may not be waived (or amended, modified or supplemented in the same
manner) in a manner adverse to the Debt Financing Sources (excluding
their Affiliates and Representatives) without the prior written consent of
the Debt Financing Sources, (ii) each Debt Financing Source shall be an
express third party beneficiary of and shall be entitled to rely upon
_Sections 11.2_ ,  _11.5_ , _11.11_ , _11.14(b)_ , _11.16_ and _11.19_ and
may enforce such provisions, (iii) the Company (on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, managers, officers and
employees (in each case, in their respective capacities as such and prior to
the Closing of the Merger) hereby waives any rights or claims against any Debt
Financing Source (in their capacity as such) in connection with this Agreement
or the Debt Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and in furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver,
it is agreed that no Debt Financing Source (other than in their capacity as
agent, lender, swingline lender, issuing bank, underwriter, purchaser or
other similar role under the definitive documentation actually entered into in
connection with the Debt Financing with respect to which capacity this
_Section 11.19_ shall not apply upon the execution of such definitive
documentation) shall have any liability for any claims, losses, settlements,
liabilities, damages, costs, expenses, fines or penalties to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, officers, directors, managers and employees (in each
case, with respect to such Subsidiaries, officers, directors, managers and
employees prior to the Closing of the Merger) in connection with this
Agreement or the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated thereby, (iv)
each party hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any Person, or
permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support any Person, in any Action,
suit, proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of
any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise, against any lender, arranger or other provider of Debt
Financing and their respective Affiliates and Representatives or other Debt
Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to,
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other
than the federal and New York State courts located in the Borough of
Manhattan within the City of New York and (v) each party hereto agrees that,
except as specifically set forth in in any agreement related to the Debt
Financing to which a Debt Financing Source is a party, all claims or causes
of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise)
against any lender, arranger or other provider of Debt Financing and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives or other Debt Financing Source in
any way relating to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New
York, without giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the
extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of
laws of another jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing set forth
in this  _Section 11.19_ limits the obligations of Buyer under this
Agreement or the ability of the Company or the Holder Representative to
enforce their respective rights under this Agreement against Buyer.
