This AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the " _Agreement_ "),
dated as of February 2, 2014 (the " _Agreement Date_ "), is made by and among
Myriad Genetics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "); Myriad
Crescendo, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _Acquisition Sub_ "); Crescendo Bioscience, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "); and the Representative (as defined below)
and, upon obtaining the Stockholder Approval, shall become effective
and supersede the existing Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Parent,
Acquisition Sub, the Company and the Representative dated as of September 8,
2011 (the " _Prior Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Parent holds an
option to acquire the Company and entered into the initial Loan Documents (as
defined below) in connection therewith. If the Stockholder Approval shall not
have been obtained by 11:59 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on February 7, 2014, or
such other date and time as mutually agreed by Parent and the Company, then
this Agreement shall be null and void and the Prior Merger Agreement, as
modified by that certain letter agreement dated January 13, 2014 between
Parent and the Company (the " _Letter Amendment_ "), shall continue in full
force and effect.

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, the Boards of Directors of
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company have each approved and declared
advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders this
Agreement and the merger of Acquisition Sub with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ "), in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, which Merger will result in, among other things,
Parent acquiring the Company, with the Company becoming a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent;

WHEREAS, immediately following execution of this Agreement, the Company will
distribute an action by written consent in lieu of a meeting pursuant to which
stockholders of the Company representing the affirmative vote of the capital
stock of the Company required to approve and authorize the Companys
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Merger will be asked to adopt
this Agreement and approve the Merger; and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

such other date as mutually agreed by Parent and the Company. The date on
which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the " _Closing
Date_ "). On the Closing Date, subject to the terms and conditions set forth

merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in substantially the form of Exhibit

in accordance with the Surviving Corporations Certificate of Incorporation
and bylaws or the terms of any Contract pursuant to which they may be serving
as such.

 

2.8 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Acquisition Sub, the officers and
directors of the Company and Acquisition Sub are fully authorized in the name
of their respective corporations or otherwise to take all such lawful and
necessary action.

the Effective Time), and excluding the Dissenting Shares, shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
canceled and extinguished and converted automatically, at the Effective Time,
into the right to receive, subject to Section 2.10(f) and 2.12 of this
Agreement and without interest thereon:

(iii) the Per Share Preferred Escrow Payment (if any) _plus_ , in the case of

(iv) the Per Share Preferred Reimbursement Payment (if any) _plus_ , in the

(c) _Conversion of Common Stock of the Company_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the parties
hereto, the Company Board or the holders of the Companys capital stock, each
share of Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including, without limitation, all shares of Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of any Company Options or Company Warrants for
Common Stock and all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any
convertible notes that are convertible into Common Stock and for which the
holders thereof have not declared the outstanding balance due and payable in
cash as of the Effective Time (whereupon such convertible notes shall be
cancelled at the Effective Time), and excluding the Dissenting Shares, shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be canceled and extinguished and converted automatically, at the
Effective Time, into the right to receive, subject to Section 2.10(f) and 2.12
of this Agreement and without interest thereon:

 

(i) the Per Share Common Closing Payment (if any) payable in cash as provided
in Section 2.11;

time and only to the extent it becomes distributable to the Company Holders,

(d) _Treasury Stock; Parent Stock_. All shares of capital stock of
the Company held in the treasury of the Company or held by Parent immediately

20 (e) _Cancellation and Retirement of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
each Company Share converted into the right to receive cash in accordance
with this Section 2.10 shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
shares (a " _Company Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive payment in accordance with
Section 2.10.

 

(f) _Tax Withholding Obligation_. Each of Parent, the Paying Agent, the Escrow
Agent and the Surviving Corporation reserves the right and is hereby
authorized to make any withholdings required by applicable Tax Laws and to
appropriately reduce any Merger Consideration payable to any Company Holder by
the amount of any withholdings or payments that are required to be made by
Parent, the Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent or the Surviving Corporation from
or on behalf of such Company Holder (including, without limitation,
withholding obligations of the Company arising from the termination and
settlement of any Company Options pursuant to Section 2.13). To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent or
the Surviving Corporation, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Company Holder in respect of which
such withholdings were made by Parent, the Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be.

 

2.11 _Actions at Closing on the Closing Date_. Parent shall take the following
actions at the Closing:

 

(a) In connection with the Closing, Parent, the Representative and
JPMorganChase Bank, N.A. or another Person mutually satisfactory to
Parent and the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") shall have executed and
delivered a paying agent agreement, in substantially the form attached hereto
as Exhibit D (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ "), pursuant to which the Paying
Agent shall distribute the Closing Payment and Working Capital Surplus (if
any) to the Company Holders; _provided,_ _however_ , that any portion of the
Merger Consideration that is to be paid to holders of Company Options
in accordance with Section 2.13 shall not be deposited with the Paying Agent
and shall instead be paid by the Surviving Corporation, out of funds made
available therefor by Parent, to such holders through the next regularly
scheduled payroll of the Surviving Corporation (or Parent, if the holders
have been transitioned to Parents payroll). At the Closing, Parent shall
deposit with the Paying Agent the Closing Payment less the Closing
Option/Warrant Amount and less the amount to be deposited with the Surviving
Corporation as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, for exchange in accordance with
Section 2.12 (the " _Payment Fund_ ");

 

(b) Parent shall make a cash payment to the Representative, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Representative
prior to the Closing Date, in an amount equal to the Representative
Reimbursement Set-Aside (as contemplated by Section 9.2);

 



21 (c) Parent shall deposit into the Escrow Fund (as contemplated by Section
2.16) with the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
an amount in cash equal to the Escrow Consideration, to be held in trust by
the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement; and

 

(d) Parent shall pay and discharge directly the aggregate amount of all unpaid
(i) Company Indebtedness, including, without limitation, the Loan Amount, and
(ii) Change of Control Payments (in each case to the extent that such amounts
are being deducted from the Closing Payment and not otherwise being
distributed pursuant to this Section 2.11), subject to receipt by Parent of
Pay-Off Letters, releases and other documentation reasonably satisfactory to
Parent reflecting such payment and discharge.

2.12  _Exchange of Certificates and Company Warrants_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any
event within three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Paying Agent to send to each Company Holder entitled to receive Merger
Consideration in respect of their Company Shares or Company Warrants a letter
of transmittal in the form of Exhibit E hereto (the " _Letter of Transmittal_
") containing instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company
Certificates and documentation for Company Warrants (the " _Company Warrant
Documents_ ") in exchange for such Company Holders portion of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate or Company Warrant
Document for cancellation (or an affidavit of lost Company Certificate or
Company Warrant Document as contemplated by the Letter of Transmittal) to the
Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Company Certificate or Company Warrant Document shall be entitled to
receive in exchange a check or wire transfer in the amount (after giving
effect to any required tax withholding pursuant to Section 2.10(f)) of such
Company Holders portion of the Merger Consideration that the holder is
entitled to receive under Sections 2.10 and 2.11, and the Company
Certificate or Company Warrant Document so surrendered shall immediately be
canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued with respect to any Merger
Consideration deliverable upon due surrender of the Company Certificates or
Company Warrant Document (or delivery of an affidavit of lost Company
Certificate or Company Warrant Document as contemplated by the Letter of
Transmittal). In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares or
Company Warrants that is not documented in the transfer records of the
Company, payment may be made to a transferee if, and only if, the Company
Certificate or Company Warrant Document representing such Company Shares or
Company Warrants (or an affidavit of lost Company Certificate or Company
Warrant Document as contemplated by the Letter of Transmittal) is presented
to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.12, each
Company Certificate or Company Warrant Document (other than Company
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time for all purposes to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender any payments which the holder thereof has the right to
receive in respect of such Company Certificate or Company

 



22  Warrant Document pursuant to this Article II. In the case of Company
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares, each Company Certificate
representing Dissenting Shares shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time for all purposes to represent only the right to receive the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL.

 

(b) _No Further Ownership Rights; Transfer Books_. The payment of any
consideration upon the surrender for exchange of Company Shares in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued and made in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to Company Shares as of the Effective
Time, and (except with respect to Dissenting Shares) following the Effective
Time, there shall be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the Company Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.12, subject to
applicable Law in the case of the Company Certificates representing Dissenting
Shares. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Certificates
shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except as
provided by Law.

(c) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Company Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then payment shall be made in
accordance with this Section 2.12 in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed the Company Certificates, upon the delivery to the Paying Agent of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and an indemnity in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent against any claim that may be
made against the Paying Agent or Parent or otherwise with respect to such
Company Certificate, including, if reasonably required by the Paying Agent,
delivery of a bond.

 

(d) _No Liability_. Neither Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation nor
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any former Company Holder for any stock
or cash held by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for
payment pursuant to this Section 2.12 properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

(e) _Return of Closing Payment; Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of
the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to the
Paying Agent Agreement that remains undistributed to holders of the Company
Certificates for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered by
the Paying Agent to Parent, and any holders of the Company Certificates who
have not theretofore complied with Section 2.11 for payments to holders of
Company Certificates shall thereafter only look to Parent for payment of such
Merger Consideration.

 

2.13 _Options_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Common Stock
that was issued under any Company Equity Incentive Plan or otherwise (each, a
" _Company Option_ ") and is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled. Each such Company Option that (x) is vested in
accordance with the provisions of the Company Equity Incentive Plan and/or
applicable option agreement

 



23  under which such Company Option was granted (whether by its terms or
accelerated immediately prior to the Effective Time) and (y) has an exercise
price per share that is less than the Per Share Common Closing Payment (each
such Company Option, an " _In-the-Money Company Option_ ") shall be terminated
in exchange for the right to receive, with respect to each share of Common
Stock underlying such Company Option:

 

(i) an amount equal to (A) the Per Share Common Closing Payment minus (B) the
exercise price applicable to such underlying share of Common Stock under such
Company Option, payable in cash as provided in Section 2.11;

(ii) an amount equal to the Per Share Common Working Capital Payment (if
any), at such time and only to the extent it becomes distributable to the
Company Holders pursuant and subject to the provisions of Section 2.17,
payable in cash as provided in Section 2.11;

 

(iii) an amount equal to the Per Share Common Escrow Payment (if any), at such
time and only to the extent it becomes distributable to the Company Holders,
pursuant and subject to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement; and

(iv) an amount equal to the Per Share Common Reimbursement Payment (if any),
at such time and only to the extent it becomes distributable to the Company
Holders pursuant and subject to the terms and conditions of Section 9.2.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that (x) is vested in
accordance with the provisions of the Company Equity Incentive Plan and/or
applicable option agreement under which such Company Option was granted
(whether by its terms or accelerated immediately prior to the Effective Time)
and (y) has an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the
Per Share Common Closing Payment (each such Company Option, an " _Out-of-the-
Money Company Option_ ") shall be terminated in exchange for the right to
receive, with respect to each share of Common Stock underlying such Option,
the same amounts set forth in Section 2.13(a); _provided_ , that:

(i) no payment shall be made unless such payment, when aggregated with
all prior payments of Merger Consideration distributed to the Company
Holders, would have caused such Out-of-the-Money Company Option to be an In-
the-Money Company Option if such payment had been made at Closing;

 

(ii) the exercise price applicable to the underlying share of Common Stock
under such Company Option shall be deducted from the first payment made under
this Section 2.13(b); and

(iii) in the event that the holder of an Out-of-the-Money Company Option is
entitled to receive any payment as contemplated by this Section 2.13(b), the
Representative shall, prior to the payment of such amount, (x) update the
Allocation Certificate to include the amounts payable to the holder of such
Out-of-the-Money Company Option and to adjust the payments to be made to all
other Company Holders, to the extent necessary, and (y) deliver joint written
instructions with Parent to the Escrow Agent to update the schedule of escrow
participants attached to the Escrow Agreement.

 



24 (c) Each holder of Company Options, as a condition to receiving any payment
under Section 2.13, shall execute and deliver to the Company prior to the
Effective Time, an option cancellation agreement in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit F (an " _Option Cancellation Agreement_ "), to
be effective upon the Effective Time.

(d) Each of Parent, the Escrow Agent and the Surviving Corporation reserves
the right and is hereby authorized to make any withholdings required by
applicable Tax Laws as set forth in Section 2.10(f) hereof.

(e) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option that is not vested
shall be terminated, without any consideration therefor.

(f) The Company agrees that the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering the Company Equity Incentive Plans) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions (including obtaining any required
consents but not including the payment of any cash or non-cash consideration,
without Parents prior written consent) as may be required to effect the
transactions described in this Section 2.13 as of the Effective Time,
including, without limitation, providing any required notices to holders of
all Company Options and obtaining Option Cancellation Agreements. The Company
shall terminate any Company Options that are not vested and the Company Equity
Incentive Plans, in each case effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time. 

2.14 _Warrants_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock (each, a " _Company Warrant_ ") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled. Each such Company
Warrant that (x) is vested in accordance with the terms of the applicable
warrant agreement (whether by its terms or accelerated immediately prior to
the Effective Time) and (y) has an exercise price per share that is less than
either the Per Share Preferred Closing Payment for the applicable series of
Company Preferred Stock, in the case of Company Warrants exercisable for
shares of Company Preferred Stock, or the Per Share Common Closing Payment, in
the case of Company Warrants exercisable for shares of Common Stock, in each
case assuming such Company Warrants had been exercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each such Company Warrant, an " _In-the-Money Company
Warrant_ "), shall be terminated in exchange for the right to receive, with
respect to each share of Company Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as
applicable, underlying such Company Warrant:

 

(i) (A) with respect to Company Warrants exercisable for Company Preferred
Stock, an amount equal to (x) the number of shares of Company Preferred Stock
subject to such Company Warrant that are vested immediately prior to the
Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the amount by which the Per Share Preferred
Closing Payment for the

 



25  applicable series of Company Preferred Stock exceeds the exercise price per
share of the applicable series of Company Preferred Stock that is subject to
such Company Warrant; and (B) with respect to Company Warrants exercisable
for Common Stock, an amount equal to (x) the number of shares of Common Stock
subject to such Company Warrant that are vested immediately prior to the
Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the amount by which the Per Share Common
Closing Payment exceeds the exercise price per share of Common Stock that is
subject to such Company Warrant, in each case payable in cash as provided in
Section 2.11;

 

(ii) (A) with respect to Company Warrants that are exercisable for Preferred
Stock, an amount equal to the Per Share Preferred Working Capital Payment (if
any); and (B) with respect to Company Warrants that are exercisable for Common
Stock, an amount equal to the Per Share Common Working Capital Payment (if
any); in each case at such time and only to the extent it
becomes distributable to the Company Holders pursuant and subject to the
provisions of Section 2.17, payable in cash as provided in Section 2.11;

 

(iii) (A) with respect to Company Warrants that are exercisable for Preferred
Stock, an amount equal to the Per Share Preferred Escrow Payment (if any);
and (B) with respect to Company Warrants that are exercisable for Common
Stock, an amount equal to the Per Share Common Escrow Payment (if any); in
each case at such time and only to the extent it becomes distributable to the
Company Holders, pursuant and subject to the terms and conditions of the
Escrow Agreement; and

(iv) (A) with respect to Company Warrants that are exercisable for Preferred
Stock, an amount equal to the Per Share Preferred Reimbursement Payment (if
any); and (B) with respect to Company Warrants that are exercisable for Common
Stock, an amount equal to the Per Share Common Reimbursement Payment (if
any); in each case at such time and only to the extent it becomes
distributable to the Company Holders pursuant and subject to the terms and
conditions of Section 9.2.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Warrant that (x) is vested in
accordance with the terms of the applicable warrant agreement (whether by its
terms or accelerated immediately prior to the Effective Time) and (y) has an
exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the Per Share
Preferred Closing Payment for the applicable series of Company Preferred
Stock, in the case of Company Warrants exercisable for shares of Company
Preferred Stock, or the Per Share Common Closing Payment, in the case of
Company Warrants exercisable for shares of Common Stock, in each case assuming
such Company Warrants had been exercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each such Company Warrant, an " _Out-of-the-Money Company Warrant_ ")
shall be terminated in exchange for the right to receive, with respect to each
share of Company Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as applicable, underlying
such Warrant, the same amounts set forth in Section 2.14(a); _provided_ ,
that:

(i) no payment shall be made unless such payment, when aggregated with all
prior payments of Merger Consideration distributed to the Company Holders,
would have caused such Out-of-the-Money Company Warrant to be an In-the-Money
Company Warrant if such payment had been made at Closing;

 



26 (ii) the exercise price applicable to the underlying share of Common Stock or
Preferred Stock, as applicable, under such Out-of-the-Money Company Warrant
shall be deducted from the first payment made under this Section 2.14(b); and

 

(iii) in the event that the holder of an Out-of-the-Money Company Warrant is
entitled to receive any payment as contemplated by this Section 2.14(b), the
Representative shall, prior to the payment of such amount, (x) update the
Allocation Certificate to include the amounts payable to the holder of such
Out-of-the-Money Company Warrant and to adjust the payments to be made to all
other Company Holders, to the extent necessary, and (y) deliver joint written
instructions with Parent to the Escrow Agent to update the schedule of escrow
participants attached to the Escrow Agreement.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Warrant that is not vested
shall be terminated, without any consideration therefor.

 

(d) The Company agrees that the Company Board shall adopt such resolutions or
take such other actions (including obtaining any required consents but not
including the payment of any cash or non-cash consideration, without Parents
prior written consent) as may be required to effect the transactions described
in this Section 2.14 as of the Effective Time, including, without limitation,
providing any required notices to holders of all Company Warrants.

2.15 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and are held by the holders of Company Shares who have not
voted in favor of the Merger, consented thereto in writing or
otherwise contractually waived their rights to appraisal and who have
complied with all of the relevant provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the
right to receive their applicable portion of the Merger Consideration, if
any, unless and until the holders of such Dissenting Shares (the " _Dissenting
Stockholders_ ") shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall
give Parent (a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any
Company Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments, documents or notices received by the Company relating to
Dissenting Stockholders rights of appraisal, and (b) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under the DGCL. Neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment. If
any Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost the right to dissent, then as of the occurrence of such
event, such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and
shall be converted into and represent the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Sections 2.10 and 2.11.

2.16 _Escrow_. In connection with the Closing, Parent, the Representative and
JPMorganChase Bank, N.A. or another Person mutually satisfactory to Parent and
the Company (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") shall have executed and delivered an
escrow agreement, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit G (the
" _Escrow_

 



27   _Agreement_ "), pursuant to which the Escrow Agent shall hold an escrow
fund in an amount equal to the Escrow Consideration, together with interest
(the " _Escrow Fund_ "), until the Escrow Termination Date for the purposes
of securing the payment of any Working Capital Deficit pursuant to Section
2.17 and any indemnification obligations of the Company Holders pursuant to
Article X. Parent and the Representative shall provide a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent of the date of the Escrow Termination Date
under Section 2.2(b)(1) of the Escrow Agreement. The Parties will treat any
escrow payment as taxable to a Company Holder only upon the release of the
funds to such Company Holder and not earlier. Upon the termination of the
Escrow Fund in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Consideration
(less any Working Capital Deficit paid from the Escrow Fund pursuant
to Section 2.17 and any indemnification obligations of the Company Holders
paid from the Escrow Fund pursuant to Article X or continue to be held by the
Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement) shall be
distributed to the Company Holders in accordance with Sections 2.10, 2.13 and
2.14 and the Escrow Agreement, and Parent and the Representative shall provide
a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent under Section 2.2(e) of the
Escrow Agreement. The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, by the stockholders of
the Company shall constitute approval of the Escrow Agreement and all
arrangements related thereto, including the depositing of the Escrow
Consideration into the Escrow Fund. Any interest accruing with respect to the
Escrow Fund shall accrue to the benefit of the Company Holders. The right of
any Company Holder to receive its portion of the Escrow Fund, if any, (i)
is an integral part of the consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii)
does not give the Company Holders dividend rights, voting rights, liquidation
rights, preemptive rights or other rights of holders of capital stock of the
Company, (iii) shall not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument,
(iv) shall not be assignable or otherwise transferable by such Company Holder,
except by will, upon death or by operation of Law, and (v) does not represent
any right other than the right to receive the consideration set forth in this
Section 2.16. Any attempted transfer of the right to any portion of the Escrow
Consideration by any holder thereof (other than as specifically permitted by
the immediately preceding sentence) shall be null and void.

2.17 _Working Capital Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Calculation of Closing Working Capital Estimate_. Not later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and
deliver, in addition to the Allocation Certificate required by Section 6.8, to
Parent a projected consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of 11:59 pm Pacific Time as of the day immediately prior
to the Closing Date (the " _Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet_ "). The
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP
(subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments) and on a basis
consistent with and using the same principles, practices and policies as
those used in the preparation of and substantially in the form of the Company
Financial Statements. The Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet shall be
accompanied by a statement (the " _Preliminary Closing Statement_ "),
certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company as being accurate,
containing all items required to be included pursuant to this Agreement and
prepared in accordance with this Agreement, setting forth in reasonable
detail the calculations showing the basis for the determination of the amounts
set

 



28  forth in the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the Companys good faith
best estimate of (i) the Closing Date Working Capital calculated on the basis
of the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet, including each respective component
thereof (the " _Closing Working Capital Estimate_ "), and (ii) without
duplication of amounts taken into consideration in calculating the Closing
Working Capital Estimate: (1) the amount of cash and cash equivalents as of
such date, (2) the Closing Option/Warrant Amount, including each respective
component thereof, (3) the Company Indebtedness, including each respective
component thereof, (4) the Change of Control Payments, including each
respective component thereof, (5) the aggregate cost of Meso Supplies, (6) the
amount of unpaid Transaction Expenses for services performed on or prior to
December 31, 2013, including each respective component thereof, (7) the
amount of unpaid Transaction Expenses for services performed after December
31, 2013, including each respective component thereof, (8) the amount of
unpaid IPO Expenses, including each respective component thereof, (9) the
amount of unpaid Fiscal Year 2013 Bonus Payments, including each respective
component thereof, and (10) the amount of unpaid expenses payable to Parent or
its counsel under the Loan Documents. All legal expenses of the Company shall
be treated as Transaction Expenses or IPO Expenses except for such expenses as
are set forth in reasonable detail on a schedule provided to Parent with the
Preliminary Closing Statement. Along with the Preliminary Closing Balance
Sheet and the Preliminary Closing Statement, the Company shall deliver to the
Parent backup materials and schedules reasonably requested by Parent.

 

(b) _Adjustment to Closing Payment_. If the Closing Working Capital Estimate
is greater than the Working Capital Target, then the difference (the "
_Estimated Working Capital Surplus_ ") shall be included as an addition to the
calculation of the Closing Payment, and if the Closing Working Capital
Estimate is less than the Working Capital Target, then the difference (the
"Estimated Working Capital Deficit") shall be included as an addition in the
calculation of the Closing Payment Reduction Amount; _provided_ , _however_ ,
in no event shall any adjustment be made unless the difference is greater
than the amount determined by multiplying the Working Capital Target by seven
and one half percent (7.5%).

(c) The Parents Right to Require a Post-Closing Adjustment. Parent shall be
entitled, within sixty (60) days after the Closing, to prepare and deliver to
the Representative a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of 11:59 pm Pacific Time as of the day immediately prior to
the Closing Date (the " _Parent Closing Balance Sheet_ "). The Parent Closing
Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP (subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments) and on a basis consistent with and using the
same principles, practices and policies as those used in the preparation of
and substantially in the form of the Company Financial Statements. The Parent
Closing Balance Sheet shall be accompanied by a statement (the " _Parent
Working Capital Statement_ "), certified by the Chief Financial Officer of
Parent, setting forth Parents calculation of the Closing Date Working
Capital, including each respective component thereof (the " _Parent Working
Capital Determination_ ").

 



29 (d) _Parent s Failure to Deliver the Parent Closing Balance Sheet_. If Parent
does not deliver the Parent Closing Balance Sheet and Parent Working Capital
Statement in accordance with Section 2.17(c) within sixty (60) days after the
Closing, or if during such 60-day period Parent delivers to the Representative
written notice that Parent accepts the Estimated Working Capital Surplus or
Estimated Working Capital Deficit, as applicable, then such amounts shall be
considered final, conclusive and binding.

 

(e) _Objection by Representative_. If Parent delivers a Parent Closing Balance
Sheet and Parent Working Capital Statement in accordance with Section 2.17(c)
within sixty (60) days after the Closing, (i) Parent and the Representative
shall reasonably cooperate with and assist each other in resolving any items
disputed by the Representative in good faith, including by making available
and granting reasonable access (during normal business hours and subject to
Parents reasonable security measures and insurance requirements) to the
Representative and its agents, including an independent certified
public accountant designated by the Representative and reasonably acceptable
to Parent, whose fees and disbursements shall be paid by the Company Holders
(initially out of the Representative Reimbursement Set-Aside), to records and
employees of the Surviving Corporation (provided that the Representative and
his agents is bound by a duty of a confidentiality reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and the Representative or his agents is not, in Parents reasonable
judgment, intrusive or disruptive), and (ii) the Representative shall have a
period of thirty (30) days after delivery of the Parent Closing Balance Sheet
and Parent Working Capital Statement (the " _Working Capital Objection Period_
"), to deliver to Parent a statement (the " _Working Capital Objection
Statement_ ") setting forth any objections that the Representative may have to
the Parent Working Capital Determination, including a reasonably detailed
explanation of the basis for each such objection along with reasonably
detailed supporting calculations. If the Representative does not deliver to
Parent a Working Capital Objection Statement by the end of the Working Capital
Objection Period, or if during the Working Capital Objection Period the
Representative delivers to Parent written notice that the Representative
accepts the Parent Closing Balance Sheet, the Parent Working Capital
Statement, the Parent Working Capital Determination, then the Parent
Closing Balance Sheet, the Parent Working Capital Statement, the Parent
Working Capital Determination shall be considered final, conclusive and
binding. If the Representative does deliver a Working Capital Objection
Statement by the end of the Working Capital Objection Period, the
Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disputed
items. If the Representative and Parent are unable to resolve all or any of
the disputed items within forty five (45) days after delivery of the Working
Capital Objection Statement, then the remaining disputed items shall be
submitted to the Neutral Auditor. The Neutral Auditor shall be instructed that
it shall, based solely on its determination of the disputed items,
prepare and deliver to the Representative and Parent the Neutral Auditors
determination of the Closing Date Working Capital, as soon as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within sixty (60) days after its engagement),
and such Neutral Auditors determination of the Closing Date Working Capital
shall be final, conclusive and binding. Parent and the Representative (out of
the Representative Reimbursement Set-Aside) shall equally share the fees and
disbursements of the Neutral Auditor. Each of Parent and the Representative
shall cooperate with and assist the Neutral Auditor to resolve disputed items,
including by making available and granting reasonable access to records and
employees. The Closing Date Working Capital as finally determined by (A)
failure of Parent to deliver a Parent Closing Balance Sheet and Parent Working
Capital Statement, or (B) failure of the Representative to deliver a Working
Capital Objection Statement, or (C) agreement 

 



30  of the Representative and Parent (including pursuant to a notice by the
Representative that the Parent Working Capital Statement is acceptable), or
(D) the Neutral Auditor, shall be the " _Final Working Capital_ ". The date
of the determination of the Final Working Capital shall be referred to herein
as the " _Working Capital Determination Date_."

 

(f) _Final Closing Payment Adjustment_. If the difference of (A) the Final
Working Capital and (B) the Closing Working Capital Estimate is not zero,
then (1) to the extent such difference is negative (the absolute value of such
difference, the " _Working Capital Deficit_ "), the Representative and Parent
shall immediately deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
pay and deliver the Working Capital Deficit to Parent out of the Escrow Fund,
and (2) to the extent that such difference is positive (such difference, the "
_Working Capital Surplus_ "), Parent shall, within five (5) Business Days
after the Working Capital Determination Date, pay and deliver to the Paying
Agent, and shall (i) cause the Paying Agent to distribute to the applicable
Company Holders pursuant to the Paying Agent Agreement an amount equal to
such Working Capital Surplus to be distributed to the Company Holders as
contemplated by Sections 2.10, 2.12 and 2.13; _provided_ , _however_ , that
payments to holders of Company Options shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with Section 2.11.

Subsidiaries, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or increase the

compensation (collectively, the " _280G Payments_ ") contingent on the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (within the
meaning of section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to the extent necessary so
that no payment, benefit or other compensation received by such "disqualified
individual" would be a "parachute payment" under section 280G(b) of the Code,
in a manner that satisfies the stockholder approval requirements under
section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder (the
" _280G Approval_ "). Consistent with section 280G(b)(5) and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, such vote shall establish the right of the
"disqualified individual" to the payment, benefit or other compensation being

opportunity to review and comment on all documents to be delivered to the
stockholders entitled to vote in connection with such 280G Approval. The

without Parents agreement, Parent shall not be required to pay an aggregate
cost for such endorsement greater than two times (the " _D andO Cap_") the
annual premium at the time of purchase; and provided further, however, that if

discharge, from and after the Effective Time, the obligations of every nature
of the Company under any indemnification agreements set forth in Section 3.17

(ii) bonus compensation and employee benefits (including equity-based
compensation) equivalent to the bonus compensation and employee benefits

that for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting in benefits and

and any predecessors thereof, but only to the extent such service was taken
into account for comparable purposes under the applicable Employee Plans prior
to the Closing Date, (ii) provide that the eligibility of the Continuing
Employees to participate in any welfare benefit plan or program of the
Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, will not,
subject to the terms of the applicable plans and applicable Law, be subject

the Closing Date) and (iii) provide that each Continuing Employee will be
given credit for all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee under any

of the applicable plan maintained by Parent, Surviving Corporation, or any of
their respective subsidiaries for the plan year in which the Closing Date
occurs.

(c) Parent shall provide COBRA continuation coverage to all individuals who
are MandA qualified beneficiaries (within the meaning assigned to such term

transactions contemplated by this Agreement for the duration of the period to
which such individuals are entitled to such coverage.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.6 shall create any rights of any

Taxes, enter into any closing agreement, settle any claim or assessment in
respect of Taxes, file any amended Tax Return, surrender any refund claim, or

claim or assessment in respect of Taxes, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 



78 (b) _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the Company Holders when due, and the Company
Holders will, at their own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable
Law, Parent will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. At Parents discretion, the amount paid to any Person pursuant
to this Agreement will be reduced by the amount of Taxes payable by such
Person pursuant to this Section 6.7(b). Any amount so withheld will be
promptly remitted to the appropriate Tax Authority.

(c) _Tax Returns_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, timely file (or cause to be timely filed)
all of its Tax Returns as they become due (taking all valid extension requests
into account), all such Tax Returns to be true, correct and complete in all
material respects, and the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, timely pay and discharge as they become due and payable all
Taxes (other than Taxes contested in good faith by the Company in appropriate
proceedings), assessments and other governmental charges or levies imposed
upon it or its income or any of its property as well as all claims of any kind
(including claims for labor, materials and supplies) that, if unpaid, may by
Law become a lien or charge upon its properties. During the Pre-Closing
Period, the Company will remain in compliance with all terms and conditions of
any Tax exemption, Tax holiday, or other Tax credit or Tax reduction
agreement, approval, or order of any Tax Authority, and will not take any
action that would have any adverse effect on the validity or effectiveness of
any such Tax exemption, Tax holiday or other Tax credit or reduction agreement
or order or otherwise result in the termination or recapture of any grant, Tax
subsidy, Tax rate reduction, Tax credit, or other Tax incentive under such an
agreement.

(d) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Company (and after the Closing, the
Representative) and Parent shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other, in connection with the preparation and
filing of any Tax Return, any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and, upon such
a partys request, the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
within such partys possession and reasonable access to employees on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Parent and the Company (to the extent
applicable) agree to (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered
into with any Governmental Authority and (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so
requests, Parent and the Representative, as the case may be, shall allow the
other party to take possession of such books and records.

 



79 (e) _Tax Certificates_. Parent and the Company (and after the Closing, the
Representative) agree, upon request, to use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or
customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person as may
be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including but not limited to with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement).

 

(f) _Tax Contests_. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, following the
Closing, the provisions of Section 10.4 with respect to Third Party Claims
shall govern with respect to any Tax audit or other Tax contest relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries if such Tax audit or Tax contest could
give rise to an obligation on the part of the Company Holders to
indemnify hereunder.

(g) _Allocation_. For purposes of this Section 6.7, in the case of any Taxes
that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period,
the portion of such Tax related to the portion of such Tax period ending on
and including the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than
gross receipts, sales or use Taxes and Taxes based upon or related to income,
be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days in the Tax
period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which
shall be the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (ii) in the case of
any Tax based upon or related to income and any gross receipts, sales or use
Tax, be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the relevant Tax
period ended on and included the Closing Date. All determinations necessary
to give effect to the allocation set forth in the foregoing clause (ii) shall
be made in a manner consistent with the prior practice of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

 

(h) _Tax Refunds_. If the Company is entitled to a refund or credit of income
Taxes for any period ending prior to the Closing Date that is attributable to
the carryback of losses, credits or similar items of the Company from any
period beginning after the Closing Date and if the refund or credit is paid to
Parent prior to the Escrow Termination Date, Parent shall forward the
amount of such refund to the Escrow Agent for distribution to the Company
Holders promptly after receipt, together with interest or other amount
received in connection therewith.

portion of the Merger Consideration payable to each Company Holder without
reduction for such Company Holders portion of the Escrow Consideration; and
(iv) any required withholdings (if any) from each such amount with respect to
each Company Holder. Any portion of the Closing Payment and Working Capital
Surplus to be paid to holders of Company Options shall be shown separately so
as to allow the parties to determine the amounts to be paid by Parent and the
amount to be paid by the Paying Agent.

reasonable efforts to ensure that all Company Warrants and Company Options
shall have been (i) exercised in full in accordance with their terms and the
exercise price with respect thereto paid to the Company, (ii) terminated or

and/or (iii) converted solely into the right to receive the payments with
respect thereto set forth in this Agreement, such that, as of immediately
following the Effective Time, there will be no Company Warrants or Company
Options outstanding (whether or not vested).

6.10 _Pay-Off Letters_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the lenders of the Company and each Subsidiary, other than with
respect to the Loan Amount, to prepare and deliver to the Company and Parent
the Pay-Off Letters in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent no later than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, which Pay-Off Letters
shall be updated, as necessary, on the Closing Date to specify the aggregate
amount of Indebtedness outstanding thereunder as of the Closing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, to the extent that any convertible notes will not be
converted into equity securities of the Company prior to or at the Effective
Time in accordance with the terms and conditions of such notes, all amounts
outstanding thereunder will be included as Company Indebtedness in the
Closing Payment Reduction Amount, and upon payment by Parent of such amounts
outstanding to the holders of such notes, no portion of the notes will remain
convertible into equity securities of the Company.

 

6.11 _Notice of Certain Events_. During the Pre-Closing Period, each party
hereto shall promptly notify the other parties hereto of (a) any event,
condition, fact, circumstance, occurrence, transaction or other item of which
such party becomes aware that would constitute a violation or breach by such
party of this Agreement (or a breach by such party of any representation or
warranty made by it contained herein) or, if the same were to continue to
exist as of the Closing Date, would constitute the non-satisfaction of any of
the conditions to the other partys obligation to consummate the Merger set
forth in Article VII hereof, and (b) any event, condition, fact,
circumstance, occurrence, transaction or other item of which such party
becomes

 



81  aware which would have been required to have been disclosed by such party
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement had such event, condition, fact,
circumstance, occurrence, transaction or other item existed as of the

supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Schedule for the purpose of
determining the accuracy of any of the representations and warranties made by
the Company in this Agreement, including for purposes of Article VII or
Article X hereof; and _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that any breach of
this Section 6.11, to the extent relating to a breach of representation
and warranty, shall be treated as breach of such representation and warranty
(and not a breach of a covenant) for purposes of Article X.

hereunder or in connection with this Agreement or any other Related
Agreement, unless by the Representatives gross negligence or willful and
intentional misconduct, and (ii) the Representative shall be entitled to rely

on behalf of the Company pursuant to Section 7.2 to be true and correct in

(b) Subject to Section 10.2, the Escrow Funds shall be available to reimburse

any indemnification rights of any Indemnified Parties that they may be
entitled to hereunder.

10.2 _Limitations of Indemnification Obligations_.

(a) _Deductible_. There shall be no liability for indemnification under
Section 10.1(a)(i) unless the aggregate amount of Damages thereunder exceeds
the Deductible, at which time the Indemnified Parties will be entitled to

(i) any Claims for actual fraud with intent to deceive or intentional
misrepresentation;

 

(ii) any Claims arising out of the misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty made by the Company in Section 3.1
(Organization, Good Standing, Qualification and Power), Section 3.2

(b) Sole and Exclusive Remedy; Recourse Against Escrow Funds and in Excess of

(i) for causes of action by the Indemnified Parties seeking equitable relief
pursuant to Section 11.7 hereof;

 



91 (ii) in the case of Claims against a Person for such Persons own actual fraud

or covenant contained in the Letter of Transmittal and/or Option Cancellation
Agreement delivered by such Company Holder pursuant to this Agreement, the
maximum aggregate Damages payable by each Company Holder shall be limited to
the Merger Consideration received by such Company Holder under this Agreement.

10.3 _Survival and Expiration of Representations and Warranties_.

(a) The representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement or in
any other agreement, exhibit, schedule, certificate, instrument or other
writing delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement
shall survive the Closing until the Escrow Termination Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each of the Specified Representations shall survive the
Closing until sixty (60) days following the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (including any extension thereof) with respect thereto.
The date upon which any representation or warranty shall terminate is
referred to herein as the " _Survival Date_." Any Claim for indemnification in
accordance with this Article X must be made prior to the end of the applicable
Survival Date. Upon expiration of such Survival Date, Indemnified Parties
shall have no right to indemnification unless an Indemnified Party delivers to
the Representative an Indemnification Notice prior to the applicable Survival
Date. It is the express intent of the parties that, if the
applicable survival period for an item as contemplated by this Section
10.3(a) is shorter than the statute of limitations that would otherwise have
been applicable to such item, then, by contract, the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to such item shall be reduced to the shortened
survival period contemplated hereby. The parties further acknowledge that the
time periods set forth in this Section 10.3(a) for the assertion of claims
under this Agreement are the result of arms-length negotiation among the
parties and that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by
the parties.

(b) All covenants of the Company in this Agreement, including the obligations
set forth in Article X, shall survive the Closing, continue in effect and
expire in accordance with their respective terms.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any Claim alleging any
misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
made prior to the Survival Date with respect to the applicable representation
or warranty shall survive the expiration of such representation or warranty
until final resolution of such Claim and payment of any Damages associated
therewith, but only for the purpose of the resolution of such Claim.

 



92 10.4 _Indemnification Procedures_. All claims for indemnification under this
Article X (" _Claims_ ") shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) _Claims Other than Third Party Claims_. In the event any Indemnified
Party should have a Claim under this Article X that does not involve a Third
Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver written notice of such
Claim with reasonable promptness and stating the nature, basis and amount of
the Claim in reasonable detail to the Representative. The failure by any
Indemnified Party to so notify the Representative shall not relieve any
liability under this Article X, except to the extent that the ability to
defend such Claim or demand shall have been materially prejudiced as a result
of such failure. If the Representative disputes the liability with respect to
such Claim, the Representative and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in
good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved
through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an
appropriate court of competent jurisdiction.

 

(b) _Third Party Claims_. Promptly after receipt by any Indemnified Party of
notice of the commencement of any action by a third party in respect of
which, if successful, the Indemnified Party would be entitled to
indemnification under Article X (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified
Party shall notify the Representative in writing (an
"Indemnification Notice"), but any failure to so notify the Representative
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have
to the Indemnified Party other than to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced thereby. Such notification shall include a description
in reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Indemnified Party) of the
facts constituting the basis for such Third Party Claim and the amount of the
Damages claimed.

 

(c) If the Representative objects to the indemnification of an Indemnified
Party in respect of any claim or claims specified in any Indemnification
Notice, the Representative shall deliver a written notice to such effect to
the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after receipt by the
Representative of such Indemnification Notice. Thereafter, the Representative
and the Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties for a period of not less than sixty (60) days
after receipt by the Indemnified Party of such written objection with respect
to each of such claims to which the Representative has objected. If the
Indemnified Party and the Representative agree with respect to any of such
claims, the Indemnified Party and the Representative shall promptly prepare
and sign a memorandum setting forth such agreement and, if applicable, an
instruction to the Escrow Agent. Should the Indemnified Party and the
Representative fail to agree as to any particular item or items or amount or
amounts within such sixty (60) day period, then either party shall be
entitled to pursue its available remedies for resolving its claim for
indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the
Indemnified Party seeks recovery against the Escrow Fund, the time periods set
forth herein shall run concurrently with and be without duplication of the
time periods set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

(d) _Indemnified Party Defense; Settlement_. The Indemnified Party shall have
the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of a Third-Party
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that any settlement of any such Third-Party
Claim shall not be effected without the prior written consent of the
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or

 



93  delayed but if such consent is unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed
then such consent shall not be required. If any such action or claim is so
settled or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action,
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for the amount of
any Damage relating thereto. The Indemnified Party will keep the
Representative reasonably apprised of the progress and status of, and consult
with the Representative regarding, the defense of any Third Party Claim and
take into account good faith reasonable suggestions of the either the
Representative or its counsel with respect to the defense of the Third Party
Claim.

 

(e) _Representative Defense; Settlement_. In the event the Indemnified Party
elects not to defend the Third Party Claim, the Representative may defend
such claim at the Company Holders sole cost and expense. In such event, the
Representative shall have no right to settle, adjust or compromise any Third-
Party Claim without the express written consent of the Indemnified Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(f) _Advisement_. The party controlling the defense of the Third Party Claim
shall keep the other party advised of the status of such Third Party Claim and
the defense thereof and shall consider recommendations made by the other party
with respect thereto.

 

(g) _Agreed Claims_. Claims for Damages specified in any Indemnification
Notice to which the Representative did not object in writing within thirty
(30) days of receipt of such Indemnification Notice, claims for Damages
covered by a memorandum of agreement of the nature described in Section
10.5(c) and claims for Damages the validity and amount of which have been
the subject of resolution by arbitration or of a final non-appealable
judicial determination are hereinafter referred to, collectively, as " _Agreed
Claims_." The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to payment for any Agreed
Claim within ten (10) Business Days of the determination of the amount of any
such Agreed Claims.

10.5 _Insurance_. The amount of Damages recoverable by an Indemnified Party
under this Article X with respect to a Claim shall be reduced by the amount of
any payment actually received by such Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate
thereof), with respect to the Damages to which such Claim relates, from an
insurance carrier. If an Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate) receives any
insurance payment in connection with any Claim for which it has already
received an indemnification payment from the Indemnifying Party, it shall pay
to the Indemnifying Party, within thirty (30) days of receiving such
insurance payment, an amount equal to the excess of: (i) the amount previously
received by the Indemnified Party under this Article IX with respect to such
Claim plus the amount of the insurance payments received; minus (ii) the sum
of any increased insurance premiums payable by the Indemnified Party as a
result of such insurance claim plus the amount of Damages with respect to such
Claim which the Indemnified Party has become entitled to receive under this
Article IX.

10.6 _No Subrogation_. Following the Closing, no Company Holder shall have
any right of indemnification, contribution or subrogation against Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their Subsidiaries, with respect
to any indemnification claim made against the Company or any Company Holder
under Article X. 

 



94 10.7 _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. The Company, Parent, and the
Representative agree to treat each indemnification payment pursuant to this
Article X as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration paid to the Company
Holders under this Agreement for all Tax purposes and shall take no position
contrary thereto unless required to do so by applicable Tax Law pursuant to a
determination as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code.

furnished to the other party in writing in accordance herewith. All such
notices or communications shall be deemed to be received (a) in the case of
personal delivery, on the date of such delivery, (b) in the case of
nationally-recognized overnight courier, on the date of delivery as indicated
by the evidence of delivery furnished by the courier when sent, (c) in the
case of mailing, on the third Business Day following the date on which the
piece of mail containing such communication was posted, and (d) in the
case of facsimile, on the date of delivery (if confirmed by machine generated
receipt).

11.11 _Representation by Counsel_. Each party hereto acknowledges that it has
been advised by legal and any other counsel retained by such party in its sole
discretion. Each party acknowledges that such party has had a full opportunity
to review this Agreement and all related exhibits, schedules and ancillary
agreements and to negotiate any and all such documents in its sole discretion,
without any undue influence by any other party hereto or any third party.

 

11.12 _Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiations and drafting of this Agreement and in the event of any ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation, no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 

11.13 _Calculation of Merger Consideration_. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, the parties hereto covenant and agree that no
amount shall be (or is intended to be) included, in whole or in part (either
as an increase or a reduction), more than once in the calculation of
(including any component of) the Merger Consideration or any component
thereof or calculation relating

 



98  thereto, or any other calculated amount pursuant to this Agreement if the
effect of such additional inclusion (either as an increase or a reduction)
would be to cause such amount to be over- or under-counted for purposes of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

11.14 _Materiality._ The specification of any dollar amount in the
representations and warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the
Company Disclosure Schedules is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor
shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the parties to
determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described
herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.

 

11.15 _Disclosure Schedules_. The inclusion of any information in the Company
Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in
and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in the
Company Disclosure Schedules, that such information is required to be listed
in the Company Disclosure Schedules or that such items are material to
the Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub, as the case may be. The headings, if
any, of the individual sections of each of the Company Disclosure Schedules
are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part
thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Company Disclosure Schedules are
arranged in sections corresponding to those contained in Article III merely
for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the Company
Disclosure Schedules as an exception to a particular representation or
warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception to certain other
representations or warranties to the extent that it is reasonably apparent
from a reading of such disclosure item that it would also apply to such other
representations or warranties, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an
appropriate section of the Company Disclosure Schedules with respect to such
other representations or warranties or an appropriate cross reference thereto.

 

11.16 _Headings_. The section headings contained in this Agreement are
inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

11.17 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of all
parties, but all of which counterparts when taken together will constitute one
and the same agreement. Facsimile signatures shall constitute original
signatures for all purposes of this Agreement. 

11.18 _Certain Waiver_. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THE DEFINITION OF "DAMAGES",
EACH PARTY, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHTS THAT IT MAY HAVE TO PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST
PROFITS, DIMINUTION IN VALUE OR SIMILAR DAMAGES BASED UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF,
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS OR
ACTIONS OF ANY OF THEM RELATING THERETO.

 



99 11.19 _Conflict Waiver_. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees, on its
own behalf and on behalf of its directors, members, partners, officers,
employees, and Subsidiaries that the Company is the client of Cooley LLP (the
" _Firm_ "), and not any of its individual Company Holders. After the Closing,
it is possible that the Firm will represent the Company Holders, the
Representative and their respective Affiliates (individually and collectively,
the " _Seller Group_ ") in connection with (a) the transactions contemplated
herein, in the Escrow Agreement, or (b) the Escrow Fund and any claims made
thereunder pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Parent and the
Company hereby agree that the Firm (or any successor) may represent the Seller
Group in the future in connection with (i) matters that may arise under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or (ii) the administration of the Escrow
Fund and any claims that may be made thereunder pursuant to this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement. The Firm (or any successor) may serve as counsel to all
or a portion of the Seller Group or any director, member, partner, officer,
employee, representative, or Affiliate of the Seller Group in connection with
any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Each of the parties consents thereto, and
waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each such party
shall cause any Subsidiary thereof to consent to waive any conflict of
interest arising from such representation. Each of the parties acknowledges
that such consent and waiver is voluntary, that it has been carefully
considered, and that the parties have consulted with counsel or have been
advised they should do so in this connection.
