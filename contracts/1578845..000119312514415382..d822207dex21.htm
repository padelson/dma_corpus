AGREEMENT

ARTICLE I. 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with
the DGCL, (a) at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease, with
the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the Company, as the
surviving corporation in the Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the
" _Surviving Corporation_ "), such that immediately following the Merger, the
Surviving Corporation will be a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Parent.
The Merger shall have the effect provided in this Agreement and as specified
in the DGCL.

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, at the offices of Cleary Gottlieb
Steen and Hamilton LLP, One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York 10006, on the
second (2nd) business day after the satisfaction or waiver of, but subject to
the continued satisfaction or waiver of, the conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ (other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions
at the Closing), unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the
Company and Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_, Parent
and Merger Sub shall not be obligated to effect the Closing prior to
the second (2nd) business day following the final day of the Marketing
Period, unless Parent shall request an earlier date on two (2) business days
prior written notice to the Company (but, subject in such case, to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
any such conditions which by their terms cannot be satisfied until the
Closing, which shall be required to be so satisfied at the Closing)). The
date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as the "
_Closing Date_ ".

Section 1.3  _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Parties shall cause a
certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be duly executed and filed with the DSOS as provided under the
DGCL and make any other filings, recordings or publications required to be
made by the Company or Merger Sub under the DGCL in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the DSOS or on such later date and time as shall be
agreed to by the Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger
in accordance with the DGCL (such date and time being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



2 Section 1.4 _Governing Documents_. The Company Certificate shall, by virtue of
the Merger, be amended and restated so as to read in its entirety in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ and, as so amended and restated, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter

_Section 6.4_. Subject to _Section 6.4_, the Company Bylaws shall, by virtue
of the Merger, be amended and restated to conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as such shall be
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

Section 1.5 _Officers and Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The Parties
shall take all actions necessary so that (a) the directors of Merger Sub at
the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors
of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation, and (b) the officers of Merger Sub at the Effective
Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected
or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. 

ARTICLE II.

 

TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

 

Section 2.1 _Treatment of Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or holders of
any securities of the Company or of Merger Sub, subject to _Section 2.1(d)_,
each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (including any Company Restricted Shares or Company RSUs
accelerated pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)_, but excluding Company Shares to be
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and any Dissenting Shares)
shall be automatically converted into the right to receive 0.3683 of a
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Share (the " _Stock
Consideration Portion_ ") and $129.22 in cash, without interest (the " _Cash
Consideration Portion_ ", and together with the Stock Consideration Portion,
the " _Merger Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, all such
Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of
such Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such Company Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_, including
the right to receive, pursuant to _Section 2.6_, cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Stock, if any, which would otherwise be issuable in respect
of such Company Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ (the " _Fractional
Share Consideration_ "), together with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant
to _Section 2.2(f)_.

 



3 (b) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, all Company
Shares owned by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or by any of their respective
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Treatment of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each issued
and outstanding share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share of Merger
Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") shall be automatically converted into
and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted appropriately, without duplication, to reflect the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent
Stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Stock outstanding after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this _Section 2.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to take any action with respect to its securities that
is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

Section 2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall
designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as the exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_
"). The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the Companys
stockholders for the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares
represented thereby. At or immediately after the Effective Time, Parent or
Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent (i) evidence of Parent Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ in
book-entry form equal to the aggregate Parent Stock portion of the Merger
Consideration (excluding any Fractional Share Consideration), and (ii) cash
in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate
cash portion of the Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration,
Option Consideration payable to holders who are not current or former
employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (" _Non-Employee Option
Consideration_ ") and any dividends under _Section 2.2(f)_ (such evidence of
book-entry shares of Parent Stock and cash amounts, together with any
dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_
"), in each case, for the sole benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock and the persons entitled to receive the Non-Employee Option
Consideration. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay
the aggregate Cash Consideration Portion, Fractional Share Consideration, Non-
Employee Option Consideration and any dividends under _Section 2.2(f)_,
Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly deposit additional funds
with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the
amount required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the
Merger Consideration, including payment of the Fractional Share
Consideration, Non-Employee Option Consideration and any amounts payable in
respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Stock in
accordance with 

 



4   _Section 2.2(f)_ out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this
Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not
expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange
Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent;
_provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that any investment of such cash shall in all
events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that
no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
the Surviving Corporation on the earlier of (A) one (1) year after the
Effective Time or (B) the full payment of the Exchange Fund.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Exchange Agent
to mail (and make available for collection by hand) to each holder of record
of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Company Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-
certificated Company Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_
") and whose Company Shares were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_ into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (including holders of Company
Restricted Shares or Company RSUs that are accelerated pursuant to _Section
2.4(e)_) (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to
the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration issuable
and payable in respect of such Company Shares pursuant to _Section 2.1_,
including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.6_, and any dividends or other distributions on
shares of Parent Stock in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_. Upon surrender of
a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may
be appointed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, together with such letter
of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_, any Fractional Share
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 2.6_, and any amounts that such holder has the right
to receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent
Stock in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_ for each Company Share formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be mailed (or made
available for collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering holder)
within five (5) business days following the Exchange Agents receipt of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share,
letter of transmittal and such other documents, and the Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be
forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with
such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to
effect an orderly

 



5  exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment of
the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
precedent of payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax
either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Payment of the applicable
Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to
the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate
and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this _Article II_, including any amount payable in respect
of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.6_, and any
dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Stock in accordance
with  _Section 2.2(f)_, without interest thereon.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company
Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not been
disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the
Exchange Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration, including any
amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.6_, the Option Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions on shares of Parent Stock in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_,
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and
compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and,
if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such holder of a
bond in such amount

 



6  as Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to any such Certificates, the applicable Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1_ hereof,
including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.6_, and any dividends or other distributions on
shares of Parent Stock in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_.

(f) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Stock_. No dividends
or other distributions with respect to Parent Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of Parent Stock
issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions shall be
paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange
Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with this
Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) there
shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment
date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of
Parent Stock.

Section 2.3 _Appraisal Rights._

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company
Shares, if any, as to which the holder thereof shall have (i) properly
demanded appraisal and otherwise complied with the provisions of Section 262
of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") and (ii) not effectively withdrawn or lost
such holders rights to appraisal (each, a " _Dissenting Share_ "), shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to _Section 2.1_, but instead at the Effective Time shall become
entitled only to payment of the fair value of such Company Shares determined
in accordance with Section 262 (it being understood and acknowledged that at
the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding,
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to
receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares as determined in accordance
with Section 262); _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that if any such holder shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares under Section 262, then
the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders
Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become
exchangeable solely for the right to receive, without interest or duplication,
the Merger Consideration.

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of any Company Shares, of any withdrawals of such
demands and of any other instruments served and received by the Company under
Section 262, and Parent shall have the opportunity to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise
or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 



7 Section 2.4 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) Except as described in Section 2.4(d), as of the Effective Time, each
option to purchase Company Common Stock (a " _Company Stock Option_ ")
granted under any Company Equity Plan that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or
exercisable, shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a
stock option (a " _Parent Stock Option_ ") to acquire Parent Stock in
accordance with this _Section 2.4_. Each such Parent Stock Option as so
assumed and converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the
same terms and conditions as applied to the Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time (but taking into account any changes thereto
provided for in the applicable Company Equity Plan, in any award agreement or
in such Company Stock Option by reason of this Agreement or the
Transactions). Except as described in _Section 2.4(d)_ as of the Effective
Time, each such Parent Stock Option as so assumed and converted shall be for
that number of whole shares of Parent Stock determined by multiplying the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Stock Award Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole share, at a per share exercise
price determined by dividing the per share exercise price of such Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Stock Award
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent; provided, however, that
each Company Stock Option (A) which is an "incentive stock option" (as
defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance with the
requirements of Section 424 of the Code and (B) shall be adjusted in a manner
which complies with Section 409A of the Code.

(b) Except as described in _Section 2.4(e)_ as of the Effective Time, each
outstanding restricted stock unit and any associated rights to the issuance
of additional Company Common Stock upon the achievement of Company performance
goals (the " _Company RSUs_ ") under any Company Equity Plan that is not then
vested shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a restricted
stock unit award for Parent Stock (the " _Parent RSUs_ ") with associated
rights to the issuance of additional shares of Parent Stock in accordance with
this  _Section 2.4_. Each Parent RSU as so assumed and converted shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as
applied to the applicable Company RSUs immediately prior to the Effective Time
(but taking into account any changes thereto, including any necessary changes
to any issuance provisions, provided for or permitted in the applicable
Company Equity Plan, in any award agreement or in such Company RSUs, by reason
of this Agreement or the Transactions). To the extent any such Company RSUs
are subject to performance vesting, the applicable Parent RSUs corresponding
to such Company RSUs shall be earned at the Effective Time based on target
performance, other than the 2012 RSUs, which shall be earned at the Effective
Time based on actual achievement of the performance goals through the
Effective Time; provided that each Company RSU subject to performance vesting,
including the 2012 RSUs, shall vest on the last day of the
original applicable performance period subject to continued employment
through the last day of the original applicable performance period or earlier
accelerated vesting upon certain terminations of employment as provided by the
terms of the Company RSUs. As of the Effective Time, the number of shares of
Parent Stock underlying each such Parent RSU as so assumed and converted
(which shall be rounded (x) up to the nearest whole share if half a share or
more or (y) down to the nearest whole share if less than half a share) shall
be equal to the product of

 



8  (i) the applicable number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
award, multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent shall have the ability to adjust any dividend equivalent rights
under any Company Equity Plan, in any award agreement or in any Company RSUs,
to reflect the changes or adjustments contemplated to the corresponding
Company RSUs by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions.

(c) Except as described in _Section 2.4(e),_ as of the Effective Time, each
outstanding share of restricted stock (collectively, the " _Company
Restricted Shares_ ") granted under any Company Equity Plan that is not then
vested shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into shares of
restricted stock of Parent (" _Parent Restricted Shares")_ in accordance with
this _Section 2.4_. Each Parent Restricted Share as so assumed and converted
shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions
as applied to the applicable Company Restricted Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time (but taking into account any changes thereto provided for
in the applicable Company Equity Plan, in any award agreement or in such
Company Restricted Shares, by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions).
As of the Effective Time, the number of shares of Parent Stock underlying each
such Parent Restricted Share as so assumed and converted (which shall be
rounded (x) up to the nearest whole share if half a share or more or (y)
down to the nearest whole share if less than half a share) shall be equal to
the product of (i) the applicable number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such award, multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. __

 

(d) The vesting and exercisability of each outstanding Company Stock Option
held as of the Effective Time by a non-employee director or consultant of the
Company or any employee or other service provider of the Company who is not a
Continuing Employee or Continuing Service Provider, shall accelerate in full,
and such Company Stock Options shall be cancelled at the Effective Time
and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, rounding such
amount (x) up to the nearest whole cent if half a cent or more or (y) down to
the nearest whole cent if less than half a cent, equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of Company Shares subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Stock Consideration Portion times the VWAP of Parent Stock
plus the Cash Consideration Portion less (B) the exercise price per share of
such Company Option (the " _Option Consideration_ "). In no event shall the
Company Stock Options described in this _Section 2.4(d)_ be assumed by
Parent. 

(e) The vesting of each Company Restricted Share and Company RSU held as of
the Effective Time by a non-employee director or consultant of the Company or
any employee or other service provider of the Company who is not a Continuing
Employee or Continuing Service Provider shall be fully accelerated at the
Effective Time (and all restrictions thereupon shall lapse) and the holder
of such outstanding Company Restricted Share and Company RSU shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in the Merger as provided in
_Section 2.1_. In no event shall the Company Restricted Shares and Company
RSUs described in this  _Section 2.4(e)_ be assumed by Parent.

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such resolutions as
are necessary to effect the treatment of the Company Stock Options, Company
Restricted Shares and Company RSUs (collectively, the " _Company Equity
Awards_ ") as contemplated by this _Section 2.4_. At the Effective Time,
Parent shall assume all obligations of the Company under the Company Equity
Plans, each outstanding Parent Stock Option, Parent Restricted Share and
Parent RSU and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof and shall
administer and honor all 

 



9  such awards in accordance with the terms and conditions of such awards and
the Company Equity Plans pursuant to which they were granted (subject to the
adjustments required by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions or such
other adjustments or amendments made by Parent in accordance with such terms
and conditions).

(g) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in Article II, any payment
to which a current or former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company becomes entitled pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ shall be made through
the Surviving Corporations payroll as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make the payments
under _Section 2.4_ payable to holders who are not current or former
employees of the Company or any Subsidiary in accordance with _Section 2.2_.

Section 2.5 _Withholding_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and
withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement,
any amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted with respect to such
consideration under the Code, or any applicable provisions of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.6 _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be
issued in connection with the Merger, no certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to
the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Parent Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by the
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in
lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount
equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Stock (rounded to the
nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form) _multiplied by_ the
VWAP of Parent Stock.

Section 3.4 _Reports and Financial Statements_.

 

(a) From January 1, 2012 through the date of this Agreement, the Company has
filed or furnished all forms, documents and reports with the SEC (such forms,
documents and reports, the " _Company SEC Documents_ ") required to be filed
or furnished prior to the date hereof by it with the SEC. As of their
respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of (and giving effect to)
the last such amendment (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy
statements, on the date of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant
meetings, respectively), the Company SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the

 



13  Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the
Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. None of the Company SEC Documents is, as of the
date of this Agreement and to the knowledge of the Company, the subject of
ongoing SEC review or outstanding or unresolved comments. The Company has,
prior to the date hereof, provided Parent or its Representatives with true,
correct and complete copies of all SEC comment letters received and response
letters submitted and other correspondence with the SEC with respect to the
Company SEC Documents, within the year prior to the date of this Agreement to
the extent such comment letters, response letters and correspondence are not
publicly available.

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents when filed
complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto in effect at the time of such filing and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows
for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto) in conformity with United
States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the
case of the unaudited statements, to the extent permitted by the SEC) applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto).

Section 3.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ ").

 

Section 3.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (a) as disclosed, reflected
or reserved against in the Companys consolidated balance sheet (or the notes
thereto) as of September 30, 2014 included in the Company SEC Documents filed
or furnished and publicly available prior to the date hereof, (b) for
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since September 30,
2014, (c) as expressly permitted or contemplated by this Agreement and (d) for
liabilities which have been discharged or paid in full in the ordinary course
of business, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any
liabilities of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise,
that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries (or in the notes
thereto), other than those which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material

 



14  Adverse Effect. For purposes of this _Section 3.6_, the term "liabilities"
shall not include obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries to
perform under or comply with any applicable Law, action, judgment or
Contract, but would include such liabilities and obligations if there has been
a default or failure to perform or comply by the Company or any Company

economic terms and other commercially sensitive numbers and provisions
specified in any such fee letter (including any provisions relating to "flex"
terms or similar concepts) excluding in each case, any such provisions that
could adversely affect the amount of the financing or the Financing
Conditions). The Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in
any manner prior to the date of this Agreement. Neither Parent nor any of its
affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter or other arrangement
relating to the financing of the Transactions that could affect the
availability of the Financing on the Closing Date, other than as described in
the Debt Commitment Letter and the fee letters and engagement letters related
to the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, the
commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and represents a valid,
binding and enforceable obligation of Parent and to the knowledge of Parent
each other party thereto, to provide the financing contemplated thereby
subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions and,
subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other laws of general application
relating to or affecting rights of creditors and that equitable remedies,
including specific performance, are discretionary and may not be ordered.
Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and
other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this
Agreement in connection with the Financing. As of the date of this Agreement,
assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article III_ such that the condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_
is satisfied, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would reasonably constitute a breach or default on the part of
Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under the Debt
Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy of
the representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ such that the
condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ is satisfied and the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_ and _Section 7.2(c)_ and
performance by the Company of its obligations under _Section 6.13_ of this
Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that it or any other party thereto
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis its obligations under the Debt
Commitment Letter. There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of
the full amount of the Financing, other than the Financing Conditions.
Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article III_ such that the condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ is
satisfied and the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.2(b)_ and _Section 7.2(c)_ and performance by the Company of its
obligations under _Section 6.13_ of this Agreement, as of the date of this
Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that (i) any of the Financing
Conditions will not be satisfied or (ii) the Financing will not be made
available to Parent on the Closing Date.

(b) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article III_ such that the condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ is
satisfied and the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.2(b)_ and _Section 7.2(c)_ and performance by the Company of its
obligations under _Section 6.13_ of this Agreement, Parent has, or will have
at Closing, directly or through one or more affiliates, all funds necessary to
consummate the Transactions, including the making of all required payments in
connection with the Transactions, including payment of the Merger
Consideration and Fractional Share Consideration and all other amounts to be
paid pursuant to this Agreement and associated costs and expenses of the
Transactions on the Closing

 



48  Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event
shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing by Parent or any
of its affiliates be a condition to any of Parent or Merger Subs obligations
hereunder.

Section 4.24 _FCPA and Anti-Corruption_. Except for those matters
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect:

(a) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary, nor any director, manager or
employee of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has in the last five (5) years, in
connection with the business of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, itself or, to
Parents knowledge, any of its agents, representatives, sales intermediaries,

applicable Bribery Legislation (in each case to the extent applicable);

(b) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary, nor any director, manager or

of violation, investigations, proceedings, demand letters, settlements, or

their respective "affiliates" or "associates" (as defined in Section 203 of
the DGCL) is, nor at any time during the past three (3) years has been, an
"interested stockholder" of the Company as defined either in the Company
Certificate or in Section 203 of the DGCL. Neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns, and at all times for the past three
years, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiaries has owned, beneficially
or otherwise, in excess of 1% of the shares of Company Common Stock.

Section 4.26 _No Merger Sub Activity_. Since the date of its formation,
Merger Sub has not engaged in any activities other than in connection with
this Agreement.

warranties contained in _Article III_ , Parent acknowledges that neither the
Company nor any Representative of the Company makes, and Parent acknowledges

all existing discussions or negotiations with any parties (or provision of any
nonpublic information to any parties) conducted heretofore with respect to

Company shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, promptly cause (to the
extent it has not already done so prior to the date of this Agreement) any

terminate (or permit the termination of (except in accordance with its terms
and not related to a Company Competing Proposal)), waive or amend the Rights
Plan, (y) redeem any Company Rights under the Rights Plan or (z) take any

without the prior written consent of Parent, in each case prior to the
termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the
Companys Representatives may in any event (A) seek to clarify and understand
the terms and conditions of any Company Competing Proposal (or amended
proposal) solely to determine whether such Company Competing Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior
Proposal and (B) inform a Person that has made a Company Competing Proposal
of the provisions of this _Section 5.3_, in each case, so long as the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Companys Representatives otherwise
comply with this  _Section 5.3_ in connection therewith.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 5.3(a)_, if
the Company receives, prior to the Company Stockholder Approval being
obtained, a bona fide, written

 



56  Company Competing Proposal from any Person, which the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith after consultation with the Companys
outside legal and financial advisors (i) constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal or (ii) would reasonably be expected to result, after the taking of
any of the actions referred to in either of clause (x) or (y) below, in a
Company Superior Proposal, then in either event (if there has not been a
material breach of the provisions of this _Section 5.3_ (1) with respect to
such Company Competing Proposal or Person or (2) in a manner that otherwise
related to such Company Competing Proposal or Person) the Company may take
the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the Person making
such Company Competing Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such
information, the Company receives from such Person an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with
such Person with respect to the Company Competing Proposal.

 

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt of any Company Competing Proposal, any
proposals or inquiries that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Competing Proposal, or any inquiry or request for nonpublic information
relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any Person who has made
or would reasonably be expected to make any Company Competing Proposal. Such
notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the
identity of the Person making the Company Competing Proposal, inquiry or
request or with whom the Company is engaging in discussions or negotiations,
and the material terms and conditions of any such proposal, offer or Company
Competing Proposal or the nature of the information requested pursuant to such
inquiry or request. In addition, the Company shall promptly (but in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours) after the receipt thereof, provide to Parent
copies of any written documentation material to understanding a Company
Competing Proposal or potential Company Competing Proposal which is received
by the Company from any Person (or from any Representatives of such Person)
making such Company Competing Proposal or with whom discussions or
negotiations would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Competing
Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and
material terms and conditions (including any amendments or proposed amendments
to such material terms or conditions) of any such Company Competing Proposal
or potential Company Competing Proposal and keep Parent reasonably informed
as to the nature of any information requested of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives with respect thereto.
The Company shall promptly (but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
provide to Parent any material nonpublic information concerning the Company
provided to any other Person in connection with any Company Competing Proposal
that was not previously provided to Parent. Neither the Company nor any of
its affiliates will enter into any agreement with any Person which prohibits
the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with, or
otherwise complying with, this  _Section 5.3_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.3_ or _Section 5.4_ to the
contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board of Directors may make a Company Change of
Recommendation (i) in response to a Company Intervening Event, or (ii)
following receipt of a bona fide, written Company Competing Proposal, which
the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation
with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors is a Company Superior
Proposal, in each case, if and only if, (x) with respect to clause (ii),
neither the Company nor any of its Representatives solicited,

 



57  encouraged or facilitated such Company Competing Proposal in material breach
of, or is otherwise in material breach of, the provisions of this _Section
5.3_ and (y) with respect to each of clauses (i) and (ii), the Company Board
of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would
constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company
Board of Directors under applicable Delaware Law and the Company first
complies with _Section 5.3(e)_.

 

(e) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under _Section
5.3(d)(i)_, the Company shall provide Parent with four (4) business days
prior written notice advising Parent it intends to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor
(including the material facts and circumstances related to the applicable
Company Intervening Event), and during such four (4) business day period, (x)
the Company shall negotiate, and cause its Representatives to negotiate, with
Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate) to enable Parent to determine whether to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement such that it would obviate the need for the Company
Board of Directors to make a Company Change of Recommendation and (y) the
Company shall consider in good faith any proposal by Parent to amend the
terms and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would obviate the need
to effect a Company Change of Recommendation or (ii) under _Section
5.3(d)(ii)_, the Company shall provide Parent with four (4) business days
prior written notice (it being understood and agreed that any material
amendment to the applicable Company Competing Proposal shall require a new
notice and an additional three (3) business day period) advising Parent that
the Company Board of Directors intends to take such action and
contemporaneously providing to Parent a copy of the Company Superior Proposal,
a copy of any proposed agreements for such Company Superior Proposal
(including any financing commitments related thereto) (or, in each case, if
not provided in writing to the Company or any of its Representatives, a
written summary of the terms thereof), and during such four (4) business
day period (or subsequent three (3) business day period), (x) the Company
shall negotiate, and cause its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent and
its Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate)
to enable Parent to determine whether to propose revisions to the terms of
this Agreement or any other agreement related to the Transactions such that
such Company Competing Proposal would no longer constitute a Company Superior
Proposal and (y) the Company shall consider in good faith any proposal by
Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any other
agreement related to the Transactions such that such Company Competing
Proposal would no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to the Companys stockholders
a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company
Board of Directors has reasonably determined in good faith after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would
constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company
Board of Directors under applicable Delaware Law;  _provided_ that this
_Section 5.3(f)_ shall not permit the Company Board of Directors to make a
Company Change of Recommendation except in compliance with _Section 5.3(d)_
and _Section 5.3(e)_ or take any other action with respect to a Company
Competing Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a Company Competing Proposal except to
the extent such action is permitted by the other paragraphs of this _Section
5.3_.

 



58 (g) References in this _Section 5.3_ to the " _Company Board of Directors_ "

Parent Board of Directors shall not) withdraw, change, amend, modify or
qualify, or otherwise propose publicly to withdraw, change, amend, modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to the Company, the Parent Board Recommendation
(each such withdrawal, change, amendment, modification or qualification, a "
_Parent Change of Recommendation_ ").

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.4_ or  _Section 5.5_ to the
contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval,
the Parent Board of Directors may make a Parent Change of Recommendation in
response to a Parent Intervening Event if the Parent Board of Directors has
determined in good faith after consultation with Parents outside legal
counsel that the failure to take such action would constitute a breach of the
duties of the members of the Parent Board of Directors under applicable Law
and Parent complies with _Section 5.4(c)_.

(c) Prior to Parent taking any action permitted under _Section 5.4(b)_,
Parent shall provide the Company with four (4) business days prior written
notice advising the Company that it intends to effect a Parent Change of
Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor
(including the material facts and circumstances related to the applicable
Parent Intervening Event), and during such four (4) business day period, (i)
Parent shall negotiate, and cause its Representatives to negotiate, with the
Company and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent the Company
wishes to negotiate) to enable the Company to determine whether to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would obviate the need
for the Parent Board of Directors to make a Parent Change of Recommendation
and (ii) Parent shall consider in good faith any proposal by the Company to
amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would

Directors under applicable Law or that such disclosure is otherwise required
under applicable Law; _provided_ that this _Section 5.4(d)_ shall not permit
the Parent Board of Directors to make a Parent Change of Recommendation except
in compliance with _Section 5.4(b)_ and _Section 5.4(c)_.

Section 5.5 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus; Stockholders  Meetings_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, (i) the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and cause to be
filed with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus in preliminary form,
and (ii) Parent shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, the Form S-4
with respect to the Parent Stock issuable in the Merger, which will
include the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus with respect to the Company
Special Meeting and Parent Special Meeting. Each of the Company and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) have the Form S-4 declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such
filing, (B) ensure that the Form S-4 complies in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act or Securities Act, and (C) keep
the Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary to complete the Merger. Each
of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself, its
affiliates and the holders of its shares to the other and provide such other
assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
The Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include all
information reasonably requested by such other Party to be included therein.
Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
or any other proxy or consent solicitation statement with respect to any
meeting of the Company stockholders or Parent shareholders, and shall, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other with copies
of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on one hand, and
the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or any other proxy or consent
solicitation statement with respect to any meeting of the Company
stockholders or Parent shareholders received from the SEC and advise the other
party or any oral comments with respect to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or any other proxy or consent
solicitation statement with respect to any meeting of the Company
stockholders received from the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments from the SEC with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comment from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) or any other proxy or consent
solicitation statement with respect to any meeting of the Company stockholders
or Parent shareholders or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and provide the other
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response in
advance (including the proposed final version of such document or response)
and consider in good faith any comments provided by the Company or Parent or
any of their respective Representatives with respect thereto. Parent shall
advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time of
effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto
or the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction,
and Parent shall use its reasonable best

 



60  efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or
otherwise terminated. Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts to
take any other action required to be taken under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws
and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of
the Parent Stock in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the holders of the
Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any
such actions.

 

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval
or the Parent Shareholder Approval, any information relating to the Company
or Parent, respectively, or any of their respective affiliates, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company or Parent, respectively, should be set forth in an amendment of, or
a supplement to, any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other Parties, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt
filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 and, to the extent required
by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or
supplement to stockholders of the Company and the shareholders of
Parent. Nothing in this _Section 5.5(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any
Party under _Section 5.5(a)_. For purposes of this _Section 5.5_, any
information concerning or related to the Company, its affiliates or the
Company Special Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the Company,
and any information concerning or related to Parent, its affiliates or the
Parent Special Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by Parent.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Governing
Documents, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Company Special Meeting. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to
the stockholders of the Company entitled to vote at the Company Special
Meeting and to hold the Company Special Meeting as soon as practicable after
the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act (or such later
date as the Parties shall agree). The Company shall, through the Company
Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders that they give the Company
Stockholder Approval, include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, except in each case to the extent
that the Company Board of Directors shall have made a Company Change of
Recommendation as permitted by _Section 5.3_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.5(c)_, if, on a date for which the
Company Special Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the
Company shall have the right to make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Company Special Meeting; _provided_ that the Company
Special Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is in the
aggregate more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the Company
Special Meeting was originally scheduled (other than, following consultation
with Parent, any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law,
including adjournments or postponements to the extent required

 



61  under applicable Law to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided or made available to the
Company stockholders or to permit dissemination of information which is
material to stockholders voting at the Company Special Meeting and to give the
Company stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any such supplement or
amendment or other information, provided that in no event shall the number of
days by such the Company Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed exceed
thirty (30) days in the aggregate, less the number of days by which the
Company Special Meeting has been adjourned or postponed in order to obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval). Once the Company has established a record
date for the Company Special Meeting, the Company shall not change such record
date or establish a different record date for the Company Special Meeting
without the prior written consent of Parent, unless, following consultation
with Parent, required to do so by applicable Law or the Company Governing
Documents. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this
Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and
matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the Companys
stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement) that the
Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at
the Company Special Meeting.

(d) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent
shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Parent Governing Documents,
establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Parent Special Meeting. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the shareholders of
Parent entitled to vote at the Parent Special Meeting and to hold the Parent
Special Meeting as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act (or such later date as the Parties shall
agree). Parent shall, through the Parent Board of Directors, recommend to its
shareholders that they give the Parent Shareholder Approval, include such
recommendations in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and solicit and use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval, except
in each case to the extent that the Parent Board of Directors shall have made
a Parent Change of Recommendation as permitted by _Section 5.4_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.5(d)_, if, on a
date for which the Parent Special Meeting is scheduled, Parent has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent Stock to
obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present,
Parent shall have the right to make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Parent Special Meeting; _provided_ that the Parent Special
Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is in the aggregate more
than thirty (30) days after the date for which the Parent Special Meeting was
originally scheduled (other than, following consultation with the Company, any
adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law, including
adjournments or postponements to the extent reasonably necessary or advisable
to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided or made available to the Parent shareholders
or to permit dissemination of information which is material to stockholders
voting at the Parent Special Meeting and to give the Parent shareholders
sufficient time to evaluate any such supplement or amendment or other
information, provided that in no event shall the number of days by which such
Parent Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed exceed thirty (30) days in
the aggregate, less the number of days by which the Parent Special Meeting has
been adjourned or postponed in order to obtain the Parent Shareholder
Approval). Once Parent has established a record date for the Parent Special
Meeting, Parent shall not change such record date or establish a different
record date for the Parent Special Meeting without the prior written 

 



62  consent of the Company, unless, following consultation with the Company,
required to do so by applicable Law or the Parent Governing Documents. Without
the prior written consent of Parent, the issuance of the Parent Stock in
connection with the Merger shall be the only matter (other than matters of
procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the
Parents shareholders in connection with the approval of this Agreement and
the Transactions) that Parent shall propose to be acted on by the shareholders
of Parent at the Parent Special Meeting.

(e) The Company and Parent will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to hold the Company Special Meeting and the Parent Special Meeting on the same
date and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.6 _Consultation as to Certain Tax Matters_. Except as set forth in
_Section 5.6_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, prior to (a) consummating
any transaction that (i) is described in clause (a), (b), (e), (g), (h), (i),
(j) or (k) of _Section 5.1(ii)_ and (ii) is not subject to Parents consent
right provided in  _Section 5.1(ii)_ on the basis that such transaction
involves solely the Company and one or more Company Subsidiaries or solely
Company Subsidiaries, or (b) altering any intercompany arrangements or
agreements or the ownership structure among the Company and its wholly owned
Subsidiaries or among the Companys wholly owned Subsidiaries, the Company
shall consult with Parent reasonably prior to consummating any such
transaction and shall not proceed with any such action or transaction
described in clause (a) or (b) hereof without Parents consent (not to be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) if such action or transaction
would, without taking into account any action or transaction entered into by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective Time, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries), reasonably be expected to have adverse
Tax consequences that, individually or in the aggregate, are material to
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or, after the Effective Time, to
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries.

information (A) that such Party or its Representatives is prohibited from
providing under the terms of a

 



63  confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date

ordinary course of business and not otherwise in breach of this Agreement (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access
or disclosure), (B) the disclosure of which would violate any applicable Law
or legal duty ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to
permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of any such Law or duty) or (C)
that is subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal
privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum
extent that does not result in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney
work product or other legal privilege); _provided_ , _however_ , that such
access and information shall be disclosed or granted, as applicable,
to external counsel for Parent to the extent reasonably required for the
purpose of complying with applicable Antitrust Laws or obtaining the
applicable waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances,
waivers, licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders or
approvals under Antitrust Laws as contemplated by _Section 6.2_, in each
case, subject to prior execution of a common interest or joint defense
agreement in customary form. Each of the Company and Parent will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses
of the other Party that may result from the requests for access, data and
information hereunder.

 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information,
including any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.1_, in
confidence to the extent required by and in accordance with the terms of the

(d) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger or other Transactions, or from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Merger or the other Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication
or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent could be material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) of any legal proceeding
commenced or, to any Partys knowledge, threatened against, such Party or any
of its Subsidiaries or affiliates or otherwise relating to, involving or
affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, in each case
in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Merger or any
other Transaction, (iii) any notice or other communication received by any
Party from any Person requisitioning the convening of a meeting of the
shareholders of such Party and (iv) upon becoming aware of the occurrence or
impending occurrence of any event or circumstance relating to it or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, which would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may
be, or which would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or
impede the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.1(d)_ shall not cure
any breach of any

 



64  representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the
date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to any Party. The failure to deliver any such notice shall not
affect any of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ or give rise to any
right to terminate under _Article VIII_ , except for any such failure that
constitutes a Willful Breach of this Agreement.

 

Section 6.2 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use

do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under

orders, registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations necessary or
advisable to be obtained by such Party from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other
Transactions and (ii) using its reasonable best efforts to take all steps as
may be necessary to obtain all such waiting period expirations
or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, registrations,
permits, authorizations, orders and approvals. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees to make an appropriate filing
of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten (10)
business days after the execution of this Agreement (unless a later date is
mutually agreed between the Parties), and to supply as promptly as
practicable and advisable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the
efforts referenced in _Section 6.2(a)_ to obtain all waiting period
expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations for the Transactions
under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, (i) cooperate in all respects
and consult with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party under any Antitrust Law, including by allowing
the other Party to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and
comment on drafts of filings and submissions; (ii) promptly inform the other
Party of any communication received by such Party from, or given by such
Party to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "),
the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Entity
with respect to any Antitrust Law, by promptly providing copies to the other
Party of any such written communications, and of any material communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party under
any Antitrust Law, in each case regarding any of the Transactions _provided_
, _however_ , that materials may be redacted (A) to remove references
concerning the valuation of Parent, Company or any of their Subsidiaries, (B)
as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (C) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns; and (iii) permit the
other Party to review in advance any communication that it gives to, and
consult with each other in 

 



65  advance of any meeting, substantive telephone call or conference with, the
DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity with respect to the subject
matter of this _Section 6.2(b)_, or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party under any Antitrust Law, with any other Person ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that materials may be redacted (A) to remove references concerning
the valuation of Parent, Company or any of their Subsidiaries, (B) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (C) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns), and to the extent
permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or any other applicable Governmental Entity or
other Person with respect to the subject matter of this _Section 6.2(b)_,
give the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in any in-
person meetings with the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity or
other Person with respect to the subject matter of this _Section 6.2(b)_.
Parent shall, on behalf of the Parties, control and lead all communications
and strategy relating to the Antitrust Laws (provided that the Company is
not constrained from complying with applicable Law), provided, further, that
the Parties shall consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good
faith the views of one another, regarding the form and content of any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of either Party in connection
with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law prior to their
submission. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement (but
subject to, and without limitation of, the immediately preceding sentence),
Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, negotiate, effect
and agree to any sale, divestiture, license, holding separate or other similar
arrangement with respect to, or other disposition of or restriction on, any of
their respective businesses, product lines, divisions or assets or interests
therein, and take such action or actions that would in the aggregate have a
similar effect, including, without limitation, agreeing to change or modify
any course of conduct regarding their respective future operations or
otherwise taking actions that would limit their respective freedom of action
with respect to, or ability to retain, one or more of their respective
businesses, product lines, divisions or assets or interests therein, in each
case, solely to the minimum extent necessary so as to permit and cause the
condition set forth in _Section 7.1(d)_ to be satisfied by the Outside Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, in no event shall Parent or any Parent Subsidiary be required
to consummate any such sale, divestiture, license, holding separate, other
similar arrangement or disposition or accept any such restriction or take any
such action or actions prior to the Closing. In furtherance of the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall take any and all actions
necessary in order to ensure that (x) no requirement for non-action, a waiver,
consent or approval of the FTC, the DOJ, any State Attorney General or
other Governmental Entity, in each case, with respect to any Antitrust Law,
(y) no decree, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or any other
order in any suit or proceeding with respect to any Antitrust Law, and (z) no
other matter relating to any Antitrust Law, would preclude satisfaction of
the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(d)_ by the Outside Date. The Company
shall agree if, but solely if, requested by Parent so as to permit and cause
the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(d)_ to be satisfied as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in any event not later than
the Outside Date), to effect and agree to any sale, divestiture, license,
holding separate or other similar arrangement with respect to, or other
disposition of or restriction on, any of its businesses, product lines,
divisions or assets or interests therein, and take such action or actions that
would in the aggregate have a similar effect;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any such sale,
divestiture, license, holding separate,

 



66  other similar arrangement, disposition, restriction or action or actions is
expressly consented to in writing by Parent and is conditioned upon, and shall
become effective only from and after, the Closing.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the expiration or termination of all waiting periods and all consents,
waivers, authorizations and approvals of all third parties, including
Governmental Entities, necessary, proper or advisable for the consummation of
the Transactions and to provide any notices to third parties required to be
provided prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that, without the prior
written consent of Parent, the Company shall not incur any significant expense
or liability, enter into any significant new commitment or agreement or
agree to any significant modification to any contractual arrangement to
obtain such consents or certificates in each case, that would have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 6.3 _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the
Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates, shall issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with
respect to the Merger or this Agreement without the prior consent of the other
Party, unless such Party determines, after consultation with outside counsel,
that it is required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the
listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market to issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement
with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions, in
which event such Party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the
circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other Party to
review and comment upon such press release or other announcement as far in
advance as practicable and shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided_ _,_ _however_ ,
that (i) without limiting any of its obligations under _Section 5.3_, the
Company shall not be required by this _Section 6.3_ to provide any such
review or comment to Parent in connection with the receipt and existence of a
Company Competing Proposal or a Company Change of Recommendation and matters
related thereto and (ii) without limiting any of its obligations under
_Section 5.4_, Parent shall not be required by this _Section 6.3_ to provide
any such review or comment to the Company in connection with a Parent Change
of Recommendation and matters related thereto; _provided_ _,_ _further_ , each
Party and their respective affiliates may make statements that substantially
reiterate (and are not inconsistent with) previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made by Parent and the Company in compliance
with this _Section 6.3_.

 

Section 6.4 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_. For not
less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless all past and present
directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
Law; provided such Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return any such
funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction has determined in a final,
nonappealable judgment such Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action,
investigation, suit or proceeding in respect of acts or omissions 

 



67  occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, in connection with such persons serving as an officer or director of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or of any Person serving at the
request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another Person, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law or provided pursuant to the Company Governing Documents or the
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any indemnification
agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement. The Parties
agree that for six years after the Effective Time all rights to elimination or
limitation of liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts
or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as
provided in their respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or
comparable organizational documents) or in any agreement shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For six years after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in
effect the provisions in (i) the Company Governing Documents and the
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary and (ii) any other
agreements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with any Indemnified
Party, in each case, regarding elimination or limitation of liability,
indemnification of officers, directors, employees and agents or other
fiduciaries and advancement of expenses that are in existence on the date of
this Agreement, and no such provision shall be amended, modified or repealed
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder
of any such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions) without the
consent of such Indemnified Party. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years
from the Effective Time, the Companys current directors and officers an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is no
less favorable than the Companys existing policy as of the date of this
Agreement or, if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable,
the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual
premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement or, if less, the cost of a
policy providing coverage on the same terms as the Companys existing policy
as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company
may prior to the Effective Time substitute therefor a single premium tail
coverage with respect to DandO Insurance with an annual cost not in excess of
three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.4_ to the
contrary, if any Indemnified Party notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person
may seek indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.4_, the provisions of
this _Section 6.4_ that require the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and
advance expenses shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until
the final disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits and
proceedings relating thereto. In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such

 



68  consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.4_. The rights and obligations under this _Section
6.4_ shall survive consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or
amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Party without the
written consent of such Indemnified Party.

 

Section 6.5 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall (a) take all action
necessary so that no Takeover Statute or, in the case of the Company, any
similar provision of the Company Governing Documents, is or becomes applicable
to the Merger or any of the other Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover
Statute or, in the case of the Company, any similar provision of the Company
Governing Documents, is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take
all action necessary so that the Merger and the other Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover
Statute on the Merger and the other Transactions.

Section 6.6  _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause each of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement and to cause Merger Sub to
consummate the Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Section 6.7 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

(a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume, honor
and fulfill all of the Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms
as in effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement or as
subsequently amended as permitted pursuant to the terms of such Company
Benefit Plans. Effective as of the Effective Time Parent shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each employee of the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by the Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof (the " _Continuing
Employees_ "), (i) for the one (1) year period immediately following the
Effective Time, base salary (or wages) that is not less favorable than the
base salary (or wages) provided by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) from the Effective Time through December 31, 2015
(x) annual cash bonus opportunities and (y) employee benefits (excluding
equity-based compensation) in the aggregate, that are, in each of (x) and (y),
no less favorable than those provided by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, that
periods of employment with the Company (including any current or former
affiliate of the Company or any predecessor of the Company to the extent
recognized by the Company) shall be taken into account for all purposes under
all employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or an affiliate of Parent for
the benefit of the Continuing Employees, including vacation or other paid-
time-off plans or arrangements, 401(k), pension or other retirement plans and
any severance or health or welfare plans (other than for purposes of
determining any accrued benefit under any defined benefit pension plan or as
would result in a duplication of benefits).

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) ensure that no eligibility
waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements or pre-existing condition
limitations or exclusions shall apply with respect to the 

 



69  Continuing Employees under the applicable health and welfare benefits plan
of Parent or any affiliate of Parent (except to the extent applicable under
Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time), (ii) waive
any and all evidence of insurability requirements with respect to such
Continuing Employees to the extent such evidence of insurability requirements
were not applicable to the Continuing Employees under the Company Benefit
Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) credit each
Continuing Employee with all deductible payments, out-of-pocket or other co-
payments paid by such employee under the Company Benefit Plans prior to the
Closing Date during the year in which the Closing occurs for the purpose of
determining the extent to which any such employee has satisfied his or her
deductible and whether he or she has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under
any health benefit plan of Parent or an affiliate of Parent for such year.
The Merger shall not affect any Continuing Employees accrual of, or right to
use, in accordance with Company policy as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, any personal, sick, vacation or other paid-time-off accrued
but unused by such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(c) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than
ten (10) business days before the Closing Date, the Company Board of Directors
(or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such
corporate action as is necessary to terminate any 401(k) plans maintained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company 401(k)
Plans_ "), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. Following the
Effective Time and as soon as practicable following receipt of a favorable
determination letters from the IRS on the termination of the Company 401(k)
Plans, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants, and Parent
or the Surviving Corporation shall, to the extent permitted by Parents or
the Surviving Corporations applicable 401(k) plan (collectively, the "
_Parent 401(k) Plan_ "), permit the Continuing Employees who are then actively
employed to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, but not inclusive of
loans), in the form of cash, in an amount equal to the full account balance
(excluding loans) distributed to such Continuing Employees from the Company
401(k) Plans to the Parent 401(k) Plan.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in
any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of
Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate
the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a
written agreement between Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or
any affiliate of Parent and the Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit
or other applicable plan or program covering such Continuing Employee.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this _Section 6.7_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or
other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of
Merger Sub, (ii) create any third party rights in any current or former
service provider of the Company or its affiliates (or any beneficiaries or
dependents thereof), or (iii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any of their respective affiliates to amend, modify
or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit, program,
agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them.

 



70 (e) No later than thirty (30) business days following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list of each "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and (i) the Companys reasonable, good faith estimate of the
maximum amount (separately identifying single and double-trigger amounts and
tax gross-up payments, if any) that could be paid to such disqualified
individual as a result of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event), (ii) the "base
amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each such
disqualified individual and (iii) underlying documentation on which such
calculations are based. Such information shall be updated and delivered to
Parent not later than twenty (20) business days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date.

 

(f) The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any material written
communications intended for broad-based and general distribution to any
current or former employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
if such communications relate to any of the Transactions, and will provide
Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
communications prior to distribution.

Section 6.8 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent
shall, as applicable, take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable hereto to cause any dispositions of Company equity securities
(including derivative securities) and acquisitions of Parent equity securities
pursuant to the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act. 

Section 6.9 _Security Holder Litigation_. Each Party shall provide the other
Party prompt oral notice (but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) of
any litigation brought or threatened by any stockholder of that Party against
such Party, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective directors
or officers relating to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the
Transactions. Unless, in the case of such litigation with respect to the
Company, the Company Board of Directors has made a Company Change of
Recommendation, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate
(at Parents expense) in the defense, prosecution or settlement of any such
litigation, and the Company shall not offer to settle any such litigation, nor
shall any such settlement be agreed to without Parents prior written consent.
In the event of, and to the extent of, any conflict or overlap between the
provisions of this _Section 6.9_ and _Section 5.1_ or _Section 6.2_, the
provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall control.

 

Section 6.10 _Delisting_. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with the

and to cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to provide such

the consummation of the Transactions) (the information and documents in
clauses (A) and (B), collectively, the " _Required Financial Information_ ");
(iv) cause its independent auditors to cooperate with the Financing consistent
with their customary practice, including by participating in a reasonable
number of drafting sessions, providing customary "comfort letters" (including

diligence activities of Parent and the Financing Sources (including by

(v) ensuring that the Financing benefits from the existing lending

sources for the syndication of credit facilities similar to those described in
the Debt Commitment Letter; _provided_ that the effectiveness of any
definitive documentation executed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
shall be subject to the consummation of the Merger. The Company hereby
consents to the use of all of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection
with the Financing, provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that
is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein or in
any other agreement between the Company and Parent (or

 



72  its affiliates), the Company agrees that Parent and its affiliates may share
customary projections with respect to the Company and its business with the
Financing Sources identified in the Debt Commitment Letter, and that Parent,
its affiliates and such Financing Sources may share such information with
potential Financing Sources in connection with any marketing efforts in
connection with the Financing, provided that the recipients of
such information agree to customary confidentiality arrangements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective directors
or officers or other personnel shall be required by this _Section 6.13_ (1)
to take any action or provide any assistance that unreasonably interferes with
the ongoing operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; (2) to
pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the
Financing or the Debt Financing Documents prior to the Effective Time (other
than customary authorization and representation letters provided in connection
with offering documents); or (3) to execute or deliver any certificate,
document, instrument or agreement that is effective prior to the Closing or
agree to any change or modification of any existing certificate, document,
instrument or agreement that is effective prior to the Closing (other than
a payoff letter with respect to the Credit Agreement). Parent shall (1)
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in
connection with providing the assistance contemplated by this _Section 6.13_
and (2) indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and its and their respective directors, officers, personnel and advisors from
and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses
(including attorneys fees), interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred in connection with the Financing or any assistance or
activities in connection therewith (other than (x) arising from fraud,
intentional misrepresentation, misstatements or omissions on the part of the
Company or any of its affiliates or (y) written historical information of the
type prepared by the Company or any of its affiliates in the ordinary course
of business that is provided by the Company or any of its affiliates).

 

Section 6.14 _Parent s Financing Obligation_.

 

(a) Parent shall take, or use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be
done, all things necessary to obtain the Financing on or prior to the Closing
Date on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter,
including: (a) maintaining in effect and enforcing the Debt Commitment
Letter and complying with its obligations thereunder; _provided_ , that the
Debt Commitment Letter may be amended, supplemented, modified and replaced as
permitted pursuant to this _Section 6.14_; (b) participation by senior
management of Parent in, and assistance with, the preparation of rating
agency presentations and meetings with rating agencies; (c) satisfying on a
timely basis all conditions to the Financing (including the Financing
Conditions) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter that are within Parents
control; (d) negotiating, executing and delivering Debt Financing Documents
that reflect the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any
"market flex" provisions related thereto); and (e) subject to _Section 1.5_,
drawing the full amount of the Financing, in the event that the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_, and the Financing Conditions, have
been satisfied or upon funding would be satisfied. Parent shall give the
Company prompt notice of any breach or threatened breach by any party to the
Debt Commitment Letter of which Parent becomes aware. Without limiting
Parents other obligations under this  _Section 6.14_, if a Financing
Failure Event occurs Parent shall

 



73  (i) immediately notify the Company of such Financing Failure Event and the
reasons therefor, (ii) in consultation with the Company, use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain alternative financing from alternative Financing
Sources on terms (including conditionality, structure, covenants and pricing)
not materially less beneficial to the Company and Parent, with lenders
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, in an amount sufficient to consummate the
Transactions, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event, and (iii) obtain, and when obtained, provide the Company with a copy
of, a new financing commitment that provides for such alternative
financing. Parent shall not, without the Companys prior written consent,
agree to any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing Document unless
the terms and conditions thereof, as so amended, modified or waived, are in
the aggregate at least as favorable to the Company and Parent as those
contained therein prior to giving effect to such amendment, modification or
waiver; _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may, without the Companys
prior written consent, (x) enter into any amendment, replacement, supplement
or other modification to or waiver of any provision of the Debt Commitment
Letter that would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the timely consummation of the Financing or the Merger, (y)
replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letter solely to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not
executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and (z) implement or
exercise the "flex" provisions contained in one or more fee letters related to
the Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto agree that
the following would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the timely consummation of the Financing or the Merger: (i)
any amendment, modification or waiver of the conditions to obtaining the
Financing, unless such amendment, modification or waiver results in
conditions that are in the aggregate substantially equivalent (or that are
more favorable to the Company and Parent), (ii) any amendment, modification or
waiver that reduces the amount of the Financing or (iii) any amendment,
modification or waiver that materially adversely affects the ability of Parent
or its affiliates to enforce their rights against the other parties to the
Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on
a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to obtain the
Financing.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Parent shall have
the right to substitute the proceeds of consummated equity or equity-linked
offerings or debt offerings or other incurrences of debt (including unsecured
notes) for all or any portion of the Financing by reducing commitments under
the Debt Commitment Letter; provided, that to the extent any such debt has a
scheduled special or mandatory redemption right, such right is not exercisable
prior to the earlier of the consummation of the Transactions on the Closing
Date, the termination of this Agreement or the Outside Date as applicable (for
the avoidance of doubt as it may be extended pursuant to this Agreement).
Further, Parent shall have the right to substitute commitments in respect of
other debt financing for all or any portion of the Financing from the same
and/or alternative bona fide third-party financing sources so long as (i) all
conditions precedent to effectiveness of definitive documentation for such
debt financing have been satisfied and the conditions precedent to funding of
such debt financing are in the aggregate, in respect of certainty of funding,
substantially equivalent to (or more favorable to the Company than) the
Financing Conditions, and (ii) prior to funding of any loans thereunder, the
commitments in respect of such debt financing are subject to restrictions on
assignment which are in the aggregate substantially equivalent to or more
favorable to the Company than the corresponding restrictions set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter (any such debt or equity

 



74  financing which satisfies the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the "
_Replacement Financing_ "; the definitive documentation for any such
Replacement Financing, the " _Replacement Financing Documents_ "). The
representations, warranties, covenants and other restrictions of Parent and
Merger Sub contained in this Agreement with respect to the Financing and the
Debt Commitment Letter shall apply equally to any Replacement Financing and
Replacement Financing Documents.

Section 6.15 _Parent Board Representation_. Parent shall take such actions as
are necessary to cause two (2) individuals who are members of the Company
Board of Directors as of immediately prior to the Effective Time to become
members of the Parent Board of Directors immediately after the Effective
Time. Any new members appointed to the Parent Board of Directors in accordance
with this _Section 6.15_ shall be selected by the Governance Committee of the
Parent Board of Directors, after consulting with the Company, pursuant to the
director nomination process set forth in Parents proxy statement on Schedule
14A filed with the SEC on March 28, 2014, to serve on the Parent Board of
Directors, initially, until the next annual meeting of Parents shareholders
in accordance with the Parent Governing Documents, and who shall also be
nominated by the Parent Board of Directors for election (or re-election) to
the Parent Board of Directors at the next annual meeting of Parents
shareholders in accordance with the Parent Governing Documents, to serve
until the next subsequent annual meeting of the Parents shareholders and
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualify.

 

Section 6.16 _Irish Stamp Duty_. Parent shall seek confirmation from the Irish
Revenue Commissioners that, on the basis that the Merger and the vesting in
the holders of Company Shares of the Stock Consideration Portion of the Merger
Consideration shall occur by operation of the DGCL, no Irish stamp duty shall
apply on the issuance to the holders of Company Shares of the
Stock Consideration Portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
Merger.

pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion. In addition, in
the event that the Company shall have paid the Parent Expenses pursuant to
Section 8.2(b)(iv) and thereafter the Company Termination Fee shall be payable
pursuant to Section 8.2(b)(i), the amount of Parent Expenses as paid shall be
credited against, and shall thereby reduce, the amount of the Company
Termination Fee.

(c) _Parent Termination Fee_. 

(i) If the Company or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to (x)
_Section 8.1(c)_ (but only in the event that all of the conditions set forth
in _Article VII_ have been satisfied or waived (other than the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.1(d)_ or those conditions that by their nature can only
be satisfied on the Closing Date)) or (y)  _Section 8.1(f)_ arising under the

(v) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be obligated to pay
the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(d) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that (i) neither
the Company Termination Fee nor any amount payable under _Section 8.2(b)(iv)_
is a penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent
and Merger Sub in the circumstances in which such payment is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Transactions and (ii) neither the Parent Termination Fee
nor any amount payable under _Section 8.2(c)(iii)_ is a penalty, but rather
is a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in the circumstances
in which such payment is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions,
each of which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. In addition, if any Party fails to pay in a timely manner any
amount due pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ or _Section 8.2(c)_, as

 



80  applicable, then (i) such Party shall reimburse the other Party for all
costs and expenses (including disbursements and fees of counsel) incurred in
the collection of such overdue amount, including in connection with any
related claims, actions or proceedings commenced and (ii) such Party shall pay
to the other Party interest on the amount payable pursuant to _Section

set forth in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made plus 2%. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, except in the case of Willful Breach, (A) upon payment of the
Company Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, none of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future
officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates or
agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Transactions and (B) upon payment of the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, none of Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, shareholders, managers, members, affiliates or agents
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Transactions.

(ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be
heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if
(and only if) such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the

or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this
_Section 9.11(b)_ in the manner provided for notices in _Section 9.4_.
Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to this Agreement

Company Related Party) and each of the other Parties hereto (A) agrees that it
will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in
any way relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Financing or the performance thereof or the transactions contemplated
thereby, in any forum other than exclusively in the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof),
(B) submits for itself and its property with respect to any such action to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (C) agrees that service of process,
summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at its address
provided in _Section 9.4_ shall be effective service of process against it
for any such action brought in any such court, (D) waives and hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the jurisdiction or laying of venue of,
and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
action in any such court and (E) agrees that a final judgment in any such
action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 

Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR

 



102  RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH OR THE MERGER, THE FINANCING AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST
ANY FINANCING SOURCE). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
_SECTION 9.12_.

Section 9.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the
Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Parties, except Merger Sub may, prior to the mailing of
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, assign, in their sole discretion and
without the consent of any other party, any or all of its rights, interests
and obligations hereunder to (i) Parent, (ii) Parent and one or more direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent, or (iii) one or more direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent; provided, that no such
assignment shall be permitted without the prior written consent of the other
Parties if such assignment could increase the risk that any of the conditions
set forth in _Article VII_ may not be timely satisfied, result in a breach of
any of covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement or adversely
affect the Company; provided, further, that no such assignment shall relieve
any Parent Entity of any obligation or liability under this Agreement.
Subject to the preceding sentence, but without relieving any Party of any
obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

Section 9.14 _Enforcement; Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable injury will occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or is otherwise breached. It is agreed that prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ , each Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy any breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by any other Party, to a decree or order
of specific performance to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and to any further equitable relief.

 

(c) The Parties rights in this _Section 9.14_ are an integral part of the
Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this _Section 9.14_ (including

 



103  any objection on the basis that there is an adequate remedy at Law or that
an award of such remedy is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
equity). For the avoidance of doubt, each Party agrees that there is not an
adequate remedy at Law for a breach of this Agreement by any Party. In the
event any Party seeks any remedy referred to in this _Section 9.14_, such
Party shall not be required to obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or
other security in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any such
remedy.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
of a breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, the Companys sole and
exclusive remedy shall be to seek specific performance or other equitable
remedies in accordance with this Section 9.14, unless specific performance or
such other equitable remedies have been determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be unavailable or an inappropriate remedy for such breach, in
which case the Company may seek money damages for such breach in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

Section 9.15 _Liability of Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, the Company (on behalf of itself and each
Company Related Party (other than Parent and Merger Sub)) agrees that neither
it nor any other Company Related Party nor any Company stockholder (other than
Parent and Merger Sub) shall have any rights or claims against any Financing
Source in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and no Financing Source shall have any rights
or claims against any Company Related Party (other than Parent and Merger
Sub) in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise; _provided_ that, following consummation of the Merger, the
foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties to the Financing under the
Debt Financing Documents.
