2.2. Nonassignability of Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, to the extent that the sale, assignment, lease,
sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or attempted sale, lease,   
12   sublease, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, to Purchaser
of any asset that would be a Conveyed Asset or any claim or right or any
benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom is prohibited by any Law or
would require any authorization, approval, consent or waiver by any
Governmental Authority or Person, and such authorization, approval, consent
or waiver shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, the Closing
shall proceed, subject to Article IV (and particularly Section 4.2(b)),
without the sale, assignment, lease, sublease, transfer, conveyance or
delivery of such asset (and the failure to obtain such authorization,
approval, consent or waiver and the failure to sell, assign, convey or
deliver such assets shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement by
Seller), and this Agreement shall not constitute a sale, assignment,
sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery of such asset or an attempt
thereof. In the event that the Closing proceeds without the
transfer, sublease or assignment of any such asset, then following the
Closing, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts and the Parties
shall cooperate with each other to obtain promptly such authorizations,
approvals, consents or waivers; provided, however, that Seller shall not be
required to make any payment that is not commercially reasonable or
compromise any rights not otherwise required by this Agreement to be
compromised or which would not be commercially reasonable to compromise for
any such authorization, approval, consent or waiver, other than filing,
recordation or similar fees, which shall be paid by Purchaser. Pending such
authorization, approval, consent or waiver, the Parties shall cooperate with
each other in any mutually agreeable, reasonable and lawful arrangements
designed to provide to Purchaser the benefits of use of such asset and to
Seller the benefits, including any indemnities, that it would have obtained
had the asset been conveyed to Purchaser at the Closing. To the extent that
Purchaser is provided the benefits pursuant to this Section 2.2 of any
contract, Purchaser shall perform for the benefit of the other Persons that
are parties thereto the obligations of Seller thereunder and pay, discharge
and satisfy any related liabilities that, but for the lack of
an authorization, approval, consent or waiver to assign such liabilities
to Purchaser, would be Assumed Liabilities. Once authorization, approval,
consent or waiver for the sale, assignment, lease, sublease, transfer,
conveyance or delivery of any such asset not sold, assigned, leased,
subleased, transferred, conveyed or delivered at the Closing is obtained,
Seller shall assign, lease, sublease, transfer, convey or deliver such asset
to Purchaser at no additional cost to Purchaser. To the extent that any such
asset cannot be transferred or the full benefits of use of any such asset
cannot be provided to Purchaser following the Closing pursuant to this
Section 2.2, then Seller and Purchaser shall enter into such arrangements
(including leasing, subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide to
the Parties the economic (taking into account Tax costs and benefits) and
operational equivalent, to the extent permitted, of obtaining such
authorization, approval, consent or waiver and the performance by Purchaser
of the obligations thereunder. Seller shall pay to Purchaser promptly upon
receipt thereof, all income, proceeds and other monies received by Seller in
connection with its use of any asset (net of any Taxes and any other
costs imposed upon Seller) in connection with the arrangements under this
Section 2.2.   Section 2.3. Excluded Assets of the Business. Notwithstanding
any provision in this Agreement, Seller shall retain, with respect to the
Business, the following (the "Excluded Assets"):   (a) Accounts Receivable,
cash and Cash Equivalents;    13   (b) certificates of deposit, shares of
stock, securities (other than securities of Silicon Wave, Sygate Technologies
and Time Domain), bonds, debentures, evidences of indebtedness, and interests
in any Person other than the Acquired Companies;   (c) any and all of
Seller\'s rights in any contract or arrangement representing an intercompany
transaction between Seller and any Affiliate of Seller, whether or not such
transaction relates to the provision of goods and services, payment
arrangements, intercompany charges or balances, or the like;   (d) all Tax
Returns other than those set forth in Section 2.1(l);   (e) the minute
books, stock transfer books, corporate seal and other books and records of
Seller and its Affiliates other than the Acquired Companies;   (f) all
current and prior insurance policies and all rights of any nature with
respect thereto, including all insurance recoveries thereunder and rights to
assert claims with respect to any such insurance recoveries;   (g) except as
expressly set forth herein, all assets of any employee benefit plan;   (h)
except to the extent Purchaser receives a license to any Intellectual
Property under the IP Agreement or the Transitional Services Agreement, all
rights, title and interests in or to the name "INTERSIL," or any derivation
thereof, as well as any related, and any other related trade
names, trademarks, service marks, corporate names and logos or any part,
derivation, colorable imitation or combination thereof;   (i) any and all
causes of action against third parties to the extent relating to Excluded
Assets or Retained Liabilities or not primarily relating to the Business or
any of the Conveyed Assets, including any claims for refunds, prepayments,
offsets, recoupment, insurance proceeds, condemnation awards, judgments, and
the like, whether received as payment or credit against future liabilities or
otherwise;   (j) all real property;   (k) any Governmental Authorization
and Environmental Permits issued to Seller, to the extent their transfer is
not permitted by law;   (l) any rights in, to and under all contracts,
arrangements, permits or licenses of any nature not primarily relating to the
Business, of which the obligations of Seller thereunder are not expressly
assumed by Purchaser hereunder;   (m) any books, ledgers, files, reports,
plans, payroll and personnel records and operating records that Seller or any
of its Affiliates are required to retain pursuant to any applicable statute,
rule, regulation or ordinance (copies of which will be made available to
Purchaser to the extent permitted by law) or which relate to the Excluded
Assets or the Retained Liabilities;    14   (n) all assets not primarily
related to the Business;   (o) any Intellectual Property or Intellectual
Property license which is not primarily related to the Business, except to
the extent Purchaser receives a license to any Intellectual Property under
the IP Agreement or the Transitional Services Agreement;   (p) solely with
respect to any claims or suits involving **, its Affiliates and subsidiaries
or any of its or their successors, the right to assert Intellectual Property
in the Conveyed Assets and to recover and retain (i) damages, costs and
attorneys\' fees for infringement of patents accruing up to the Closing Date
and (ii) damages, costs and attorneys\' fees accruing up to the Closing Date
for any injunction action for misappropriation of trade secrets;   (q) all
of Seller\'s rights under this Agreement and any agreement or other written
instrument entered into in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby; and   (r) those assets listed in Schedule 2.3(r).   Section 2.4.
Assumption of Certain Obligations of the Business. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser agrees, effective at the
Closing, to assume all Liabilities of Seller recorded to the Reference
Balance Sheet and all liabilities of Seller, to the extent relating to the
Conveyed Assets or the Business, of the types recorded to the
Reference Balance Sheet arising between the date of the Reference Balance
Sheet and the Closing Date in the ordinary course of business (all of the
foregoing liabilities and obligations, together with the liabilities and
obligations set forth in the following sentence being herein collectively
called the "Assumed Liabilities"). Assumed Liabilities shall include, without
limitation, the following:   (a) all lawsuits and claims, to the extent
resulting from the conduct of the Business or the ownership of the Conveyed
Assets, on or after the Closing Date, except as expressly provided
herein;   (b) all Liabilities arising from the manufacture,
distribution, use, importation, offer for sale or sale of any products of the
Business on or after the Closing Date, including, without limitation,
warranty obligations and ship from stock and debit provisions;   (c) any
Tax that may be imposed by any federal, state or local government on the
ownership, sale, operation or use of the Conveyed Assets on or after the
Closing Date, except for any income taxes attributable to income received by
Seller and except for any and all Liabilities for Taxes related to the
Business or the Conveyed Assets for taxable periods prior to and
including the Closing Date, including all Pre-Closing Taxes (as defined in
Section 7.13(b)) other than Taxes attributable to actions of Purchaser
occurring after the Closing;   (d) all Liabilities of the Business arising
and to be performed from and after the Closing Date under or relating to the
Assumed Contracts; and   (e) those Liabilities with respect to Affected
Employees that are expressly assumed by Purchaser pursuant to Section
7.5.  ------------- ** This portion of the Agreement is omitted and has
been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to
a request for confidential treatment.   15  Purchaser\'s obligations
under this Section 2.4 shall not be subject to offset or reduction by reason
of any actual or alleged breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement or any Schedule or Exhibit hereto, or any closing
or other document contemplated by this Agreement or any Schedule or Exhibit
hereto, any right or alleged right of indemnification hereunder, or for any
other reason.   Section 2.5. Retained Liabilities of the Business. Seller
shall retain and be responsible for the Liabilities other than the Assumed
Liabilities (collectively, "Retained Liabilities").   Section 2.6. Purchase
Price. In consideration of the sale and transfer of the Conveyed Assets,
Purchaser shall (i) pay to Seller an aggregate amount of $250,000,000 in cash
(the "Cash Consideration"), in immediately available funds, by wire transfer
in accordance with written instructions given by Seller to Purchaser not less
than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, and a number of shares of
common stock, $.001 par value ("Purchaser Common Stock"), of Purchaser equal
to the Purchaser Common Stock Amount (the "Equity Consideration", and
together with the Cash Consideration, the "Purchase Price"), which
consideration shall be allocated as described in Section 2.7; and (ii) assume
the Assumed Liabilities.   Section 2.7. Allocation of Purchase Price. Seller
and Purchaser recognize their mutual obligations pursuant to Section 1060 of
the Code (and any comparable provisions of any other Tax law) to timely file
IRS Form 8594 (or comparable form) and subsequent Forms 8594 (or comparable
forms), if any are required, with each of their respective Tax Returns (the
"Asset Allocation Statements"). Accordingly, Seller and Purchaser agree to
cooperate in the preparation of any Asset Allocation Statements. Within 45
days following the date of this Agreement, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser
a statement of allocation of the Purchase Price and all other items properly
included in "consideration" among the Conveyed Assets, which shall specify in
reasonable detail the amount (supported by an appraisal to be obtained by the
Seller, provided by an appraiser selected by Seller and Purchaser) to be
allocated to inventory, customer base, work force, intellectual property and
other intangible assets (i.e. goodwill) located both inside and outside the
United States (the "Allocation"). Purchaser and Seller will endeavor in good
faith to resolve any differences with respect to the Allocation within 30
days following Purchaser\'s receipt of the Allocation from Seller. If
Purchaser withholds its consent to the Allocation after such 30-day period,
then any remaining disputed matters will be finally and conclusively
determined by an independent accounting firm of recognized national standing
(the "Allocation Arbiter") selected by Purchaser and Seller. Promptly, but
not later than 30 days after its acceptance of appointment hereunder, the
Allocation Arbiter will determine (based solely on presentations by Seller
and Purchaser and not by independent review) only those matters in dispute
and will render a written report as to the disputed matters and the resulting
allocation of Purchase Price (together with any assumed liabilities), which
report shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties. Each of Seller and
Purchaser shall (i) be bound by the Allocation for purposes of determining
any Taxes, (ii) prepare and file, and cause its Affiliates to prepare and
file, its Tax Returns on a basis consistent with the Allocation, and (iii)
take no position, and cause its Affiliates to take no position, inconsistent
with the Allocation on any applicable Tax Return or in any proceeding before
any taxing authority or otherwise. In the event that the Allocation is
disputed by any taxing authority, the Party receiving notice of the dispute
shall promptly notify the other Party hereto concerning resolution of the
dispute. Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that the Allocation was made
in    16  accordance with the provisions of Section 1060 of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Purchaser and Seller agree that the
Equity Consideration shall be treated as taxable consideration paid for the
Conveyed Assets for all income tax purposes and the parties hereto shall file
all Tax Returns on a basis consistent therewith. Purchaser and Seller agree
that the portion of the Purchase Price attributable to each of SiCom and
Choice-Intersil shall be comprised one-third (1/3) in the form of Equity
Consideration and two-thirds (2/3) in the form of Cash Consideration.  
Section 2.8. Apportionment at Closing and Related Matters.   (a) At the
Closing, the Parties shall make the usual adjustments relating to the
Business as of the Closing Date, including prepaid lease payments, security
deposits, rents, real estate taxes, local improvements charges, assessments
(special and ordinary), sewer impost charges, utility charges, water rents,
monthly maintenance charges, rebates and royalties, deposits and prepaid
expenses with any public utility or any municipal, governmental or other
public authority, wages and any other ongoing charges, if any, and all such
payments, taxes and charges shall be apportioned and adjusted as of the
Closing Date, and at the Closing the net amount thereof shall be paid pro
rata by Seller to Purchaser or by Purchaser to Seller, as the case may
be. Any such apportionments and adjustments shall be subject to correction
for any errors or omissions that subsequently may be discovered, provided
that the Party discovering such error or omission provides written notice of
same to the other Party. Such other Party shall, within 30 days after receipt
of such notice, reimburse the Party delivering such notice for the full
amount of such error or omission.   (b) If at any time after the Closing
Date (i) Seller shall come into possession of any of the Assumed Liabilities
or Conveyed Assets, Seller shall immediately transfer such assets or
liabilities to Purchaser or (ii) Purchaser shall come into possession of any
of the Retained Liabilities or Excluded Assets, Purchaser shall immediately
transfer such assets or liabilities to Seller.   (c) The Parties will
cooperate as provided for in the IP Agreement to assure the transfer and
recordation of the Intellectual Property transferred under the IP
Agreement.   Section 2.9. Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment.   (a)
Not more than 90 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to
Seller a balance sheet for the Business as of the Closing Date (the "Closing
Date Balance Sheet"). The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP in a manner consistent with the Reference Balance
Sheet. From the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to Seller, within such 90-day period, a statement (the "Statement")
setting forth the calculation of the Working Capital as of the Closing (the
"Closing Date Working Capital"). After the Closing Date, Seller shall provide
Purchaser and its representatives any information reasonably requested to
prepare the Closing Date Balance Sheet and shall provide them access at all
reasonable times to the personnel, properties, books and records relating to
the Business for such purpose.    17   (b) Objections; Resolution of
Disputes.   (i) Unless Seller notifies Purchaser in writing within 30 days
after Purchaser\'s delivery of the Statement of any objection to
the computation of Closing Date Working Capital set forth therein (the
"Notice of Objection"), the Statement shall become final and binding. During
such 30-day period, Seller and its representatives shall be permitted to
review the working papers of Purchaser and Purchaser\'s accountants relating
to the Statement, and Purchaser shall provide Seller and its representatives
any information reasonably requested and shall provide them access at all
reasonable times to the personnel, properties, books and records relating to
the Business for such purpose. Any Notice of Objection shall specify in
reasonable detail the basis for the objections set forth therein. Any Notice
of Objection shall include only objections based on (A) mathematical errors
in the computation of Closing Date Working Capital or (B) Closing Date
Working Capital not having been calculated in accordance with Section
2.9(a).   (ii) If Seller provides the Notice of Objection to
Purchaser within such 30-day period, Seller and Purchaser shall, during the
30-day period following Purchaser\'s receipt of the Notice of Objection,
attempt in good faith to resolve Seller\'s objections. During such 30-day
period, Purchaser and its representatives shall be permitted to review the
working papers of Seller and Seller\'s accountants relating to the Notice of
Objection and the basis therefor. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to
resolve all such objections within such 30-day period, the matters remaining
in dispute shall be submitted to a nationally recognized public accounting
firm mutually agreed upon and jointly engaged by Seller and Purchaser and, if
Seller and Purchaser are unable to so agree within 10 days after the end of
such 30-day period, then Seller and Purchaser shall each select such a firm
and such firms shall jointly select a third nationally recognized firm to be
jointly engaged by Seller and Purchaser to resolve the disputed matters (such
selected firm being the "Independent Expert"). The parties shall instruct the
Independent Expert to render its reasoned written decision as promptly as
practicable but in no event later than 60 days after its selection. The
resolution of disputed items by the Independent Expert shall be final and
binding, and the determination of the Independent Expert shall constitute an
arbitral award that is final, binding and non-appealable and upon which a
judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereover. The fees
and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be allocated between Seller and
Purchaser in such a way that Purchaser shall be responsible for that portion
of the fees and expenses equal to such fees and expenses multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the aggregate dollar value of disputed
items submitted to the Independent Expert by Seller that are resolved against
Purchaser (as finally determined by the Independent Expert) and the
denominator of which is the total dollar value of the disputed items
so submitted by Seller, and Seller shall be responsible for the remainder of
such fees and expenses.   (c) Adjustment Payment. Within 10 days after the
Statement has become final and binding in accordance with this Section 2.9,
(i) if the Closing Date Working Capital is greater than the Reference Working
Capital, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount in cash equal to such
difference and (ii) if the Closing Date Working Capital is less than the
Reference Working Capital, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount in cash
equal to such difference. Any such payment hereunder shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing
by Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be.    18   ARTICLE III.

including Intellectual Property, to any inventions, improvements, discoveries
or information relating to the Business.   (g) Except as indicated in
Schedule 5.11, none of Intellectual Property relating to the Business
constitutes or includes any open source computer code, and solely as a result
of the use of open source computer code none of the Intellectual Property
relating to the Business is subject to any license, sublicense or other
Contractual Obligation that would require Seller or any of its Affiliates to
divulge to any Person any source code or trade secret that is part of the
Intellectual Property used in the Business.    27   (h) Neither the
operation of the Business nor any of the products or services made, have-
made, used, sold, or imported in the conduct of the Business infringe or
constitute a misappropriation of any Intellectual Property rights of any
third-party.   Section 5.12. Assets. Other than Permitted Encumbrances or as

properties and rights of every type and description, whether real or
personal, tangible or intangible, primarily used in Business and are
adequate to enable Purchaser to operate and conduct the Business after
Closing in substantially the same manner as the Business has heretofore been
conducted by Seller and the Acquired Companies.   Section 5.13. Acquired
Companies. Seller or one of its Affiliates is the lawful record owner of the
Equity Interests of the Acquired Companies, which ownership is free and clear
of any Liens. Assuming Purchaser has the requisite power and authority to be
the lawful owner of the Equity Interests of the Acquired Companies, upon
delivery to Purchaser at the Closing of certificates representing the Equity
Interests of the Acquired Companies, duly endorsed by Seller or one of its
Affiliates for transfer to Purchaser against payment therefor as provided in
Article II, good and valid title to the Equity Interests of the Acquired
Companies will pass to Purchaser, free and clear of any Liens, other than
those arising from acts of Purchaser or its Affiliates. The delivery to
Purchaser of the Equity Interests of the Acquired Companies pursuant to
this Agreement will transfer to Purchaser ownership of one hundred percent
(100%) of the authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock of the
Acquired Companies. All outstanding shares of the Acquired Companies are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.   Section 5.14.

records of the Business.   Section 5.15. Financial Information. Set forth in
Schedule 5.15 are the audited balance sheets of the Business as at January 3,

December 29, 2000, together with the related audited statements of
operations, product group equity and cash flows for the fiscal years then
ended, accompanied by any notes thereto and the report of Ernst and Young LLP
(collectively, the "Audited Financials"). Also set forth are the Reference
Balance Sheet as at April 4, 2003 and the related    28  unaudited
statement of revenues, costs and related expenses, depreciation and capital
expenditures for the three months then ended (the "Interim Financials," and
together with the Audited Financials, collectively, "Financial Information").
The Financial Information was derived from the internal books and records of
Seller and has been prepared in a manner consistent with Seller\'s current
accounting practices with respect to the Business. The Financial Information
is complete and accurate, is presented in accordance with GAAP, applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and presents fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position and the results of operations
of the Business for the periods indicated in the manner set forth in Schedule
5.15, except for the omission of certain information required to be included
in footnotes to the Interim Financials, which footnotes have not
been prepared by Seller. Seller makes no other representations with regard to
the Financial Information. Without limiting any of the foregoing,
Purchaser acknowledges that the Financial Information was prepared solely for
the purpose of this Agreement and that the Business was not conducted on a
stand-alone basis as a separate entity during the periods indicated in the
Financial Information and that the Financial Information includes allocations
and estimates not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have
resulted if the Business had been operated and conducted on a stand-alone
basis as a separate entity during such periods.   Section 5.16. Taxes. (a)
Except as set forth in Schedule 5.16, all material Tax Returns that are

timely filed, such material Tax Returns are true and complete in all material
respects, and all Taxes shown to be due and payable on such Tax Returns have
been or will be paid in full on a timely basis to appropriate authorities;
provided, however, that this representation relates only to Taxes (i) that
are or may become Liens on the Conveyed Assets, (ii) for which Purchaser may
be liable as a transferee of the Conveyed Assets or (iii) for which the
Acquired Companies may be liable. There are no Liens for Taxes upon any of
the Conveyed Assets, except for Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or
which are Permitted Encumbrances. Each of Intersil BV and No Wires Needed
is a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes within the meaning
of Treas. Reg. ss. 301.7701-3.   Section 5.17. Employee Benefits.   (a)
Schedule 5.17 lists each Plan (i) which is sponsored or maintained by Seller
or any of its Affiliates or to which Seller or any of its Affiliates

Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
either individually or in the aggregate, no event has occurred in respect of
any Business Employee Plan that could be reasonably expected to subject (i)
Purchaser to any penalty or liability under Title I or Title IV of ERISA or
under Chapter 43 of the Code, or (ii) any of the Conveyed Assets to a lien
under Title I or Title IV of ERISA or under the Code. For purposes of
this Agreement the term "ERISA Affiliate" means any entity that is, or was at
any time for which any relevant statute of limitations remains open, together
with Seller, treated as a "single employer" under Sections 414(b), 414(c) or
414(m) of the Code. Neither Seller nor its Affiliates have been required to
contribute to any "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 4001(a)(8) of
ERISA at any time in the seven years immediately preceding the Closing
Date.   (d) The Seller Savings Plan is intended to be qualified under Code
Section 401(a) and is so qualified. The Seller Savings Plan, including
any associated trust or fund, has in all material respects been administered
in accordance with its terms and with applicable Laws.   (e) SiCom is not
currently the sponsor of, nor does it currently maintain, any Plan, and SiCom
has not sponsored or maintained any Plan during the six-year period preceding
the Closing Date.   (f) Intersil BV is in compliance, in all material

Companies is a party to, bound by or subject to (and none of the assets or
properties of Seller or any of the Acquired Companies is subject to) any
labor agreement or collective bargaining agreement respecting the Employees,
nor is there any pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened labor
dispute of any kind, any work stoppage or any union organizing effort by or
respecting the Employees, and Seller has not has experienced any labor
interruptions over the past three years.   (b) Schedule 5.18 sets forth a
complete and accurate list of all Employees and of all consultants and other
independent contractors who provide services to the Business having an annual
base salary (or, in the case of any independent contractor, annual contract
remuneration) in calendar year 2002 of $100,000 or more, their title or
function, current compensation and bonus arrangements, and, if not a citizen
of the United States, the status and duration of that Employee\'s,
independent contractor\'s or consultant\'s visa and/or work permit, if any,
providing a legal basis for employment. All independent contractors of the
Business are properly classified as an independent contractor for purposes of
any employment related Law or any Law concerning the status of independent
contractors.   (c) Except for Employees previously disclosed to Purchaser,
there are no other Employees who are necessary to the conduct of the Business
and to enable Purchaser to operate and conduct the Business after Closing
in substantially the same manner as the Business has heretofore been
conducted by Seller.    30   Section 5.19. Brokers. Except as set forth

brokerage, finder\'s or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by

material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading. None of the information supplied by Seller
for inclusion or incorporation in the Registration Statement, if Purchaser
files a Registration Statement pursuant to Section 7.15(b), shall at the time
the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC or at the time it becomes

Employees - Offer of Employment; Continued Employment; Severance. As of 12:01
a.m. on the day immediately following the Closing Date (the "Effective
Time"), Purchaser agrees to employ each Employee (other than any Employee on

absence, including without any limitation any Employee on maternity leave,

pay at least equal to the Employee\'s rate of pay in effect on the Closing

For purposes of this Section 7.5, references to "pay" shall include base pay
plus any commission and, for 2003 an opportunity to earn under the terms of
the Purchaser\'s bonus program, a dollar amount equal to not less than 100%

7.5(a) (which shall be updated by Seller on the Closing Date) shall set forth
the name of each Employee and his or her current rate of base pay, bonus or
commission arrangements, current work location, position, date of hire and
service creditable under the following provisions of this Section 7.5(a).
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for all wages and other compensation
(including bonuses, incentive payments and commissions) accruing with respect
to periods after the Closing Date with respect to the Affected Employees, as
well as compliance with all legal duties owed to such Employees following the
Closing Date, except for those duties and obligations for which Seller or its
Affiliates remain liable in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to
applicable law, Purchaser may change the conditions of employment after the
Closing Date. Employees shall also be provided credit by Purchaser for all
service with Seller and its Affiliates, to the same extent as such service
was credited by Seller and its Affiliates, under (x) all employee benefit
plans, programs, policies and fringe benefits of Purchaser for purposes of
eligibility and vesting and (y) in addition, in respect of severance plans,
programs and policies, for purposes of calculating the amount of each
Employee\'s severance benefits. Purchaser shall have no obligation whatsoever
with regard to former employees of the Business who are not Employees as of
the Closing Date.   (b) Savings Plans.   (i) At the Effective Time, each
participant in the Seller Savings Plan (as defined in Section 7.5(b)(ii)
below) who is an Affected Employee shall cease to be an active participant
under such Plan, and shall become a participant in the Purchaser Savings Plan
(as defined in Section 7.5(b)(ii) below). If Purchaser does not have a tax
qualified 401(k) plan, Purchaser shall adopt a plan or plans to cover the
Affected Employees as of the Closing Date. Purchaser shall ensure that the
Purchaser Savings Plan will recognize the accrued service of Affected
Employees with Seller and its Affiliates up to and including the Closing Date
for all relevant purposes, to the extent credited under the terms of the
Seller Savings Plan as in effect on the Closing Date. As soon as practicable
after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver such accrued service data to
Purchaser.   (ii) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Seller and
Purchaser shall, if necessary, file IRS Form 5310-A for their respective
tax qualified 401(k) plans, giving 30 days advance notice of a transfer of
assets from the Intersil Corporation Retirement Plans (the "Seller Savings
Plan") to the savings plan sponsored by Purchaser that is a plan qualified
under section 401(k) of the Code (the "Purchaser Savings Plan"). As soon as
practicable after the 30-day periods from the dates of filing of the IRS
Forms 5310-A have been completed, or if such filings are unnecessary, as soon
as practicable, but in no event more than 180 days after Closing, Seller
shall cause the Seller Savings Plan to transfer the account balances of all
Affected Employees in cash to the Purchaser Savings Plan. Purchaser, on the
one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, each agree to use its reasonable
efforts and to cooperate with the other to effect as promptly as possible the
transfers of assets contemplated under this Section 7.5(b)(ii), subject to
Seller\'s and Purchaser\'s receipt, each from the other, of reasonably
satisfactory evidence that the Purchaser Savings Plan and the Seller Savings
Plan, respectively, are in compliance with all relevant Tax and labor Laws
(including ERISA).   (iii) To the extent permitted by applicable law, Seller
will give Purchaser reasonable access to the records of Seller necessary
to administer the retirement benefits of Affected Employees transferred to
the Purchaser Savings Plan.     38   (c) Accrued Entitlements. Each
Affected Employee shall cease to participate in the employee benefit plans,
programs and arrangements of Seller immediately prior to the Effective Time
applicable to such Affected Employee. Neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates
shall have any liability for, and Seller shall be solely liable and
responsible for, (i) compensation, if any, payable to or for the benefit of
any person prior to such time, if any, as such person becomes an Affected
Employee, and subject to Section 7.5(b), in the case of each Affected
Employee, all compensation with respect to periods prior to the Effective
Time, and (ii) liabilities, if any, incurred under any employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement of Seller or its Affiliates by any person who does not
become an Affected Employee, and, in the case of each Affected Employee, and
subject to Section 7.5(b) all liabilities incurred under any employee benefit
plan, program or arrangement of Seller or its Affiliates that is incurred
prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of the foregoing, the following
liabilities shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (A) in the case of
life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance or
business travel accident insurance, when the death or accident giving rise to
the claim occurs; (B) in the case of disability benefits, when the individual
becomes entitled to benefits under the terms of the applicable disability
plan of Seller or Purchaser as the case may be; and (C) in the case of
health, dental and/or prescription drug benefits, when the services,
materials or supplies for which coverage is claimed are provided or sold.
Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have no
liability for, and Seller shall be solely liable and responsible for, the
severance or similar separation pay benefits, if any, with respect to any
person who does not become an Affected Employee.   (d) Medical and Welfare
Plan Obligations. Commencing at the Effective Time, Purchaser shall include
the Affected Employees in its welfare plans subject to the following
sentence. Purchaser agrees to waive any waiting periods or limitations for
preexisting conditions under its medical and dental plans and agrees in good
faith to use its commercially reasonable efforts to waive any waiting periods
or limitations for preexisting conditions under its short-term and long-term
disability plans, other than any such limitation or waiting period to which
the Affected Employee would have been subject, and which would not have been
satisfied, at the Effective Time if the applicable Business Employee Plan had
applied the same rules as the applicable Purchaser medical or dental plan,
and to ensure that the Affected Employees are given credit for any amounts
paid toward deductibles, out-of-pocket limits or similar fees on or prior to
the Closing Date and during the plan year in which the Closing
Date falls.   (e) Flexible Spending Accounts. Seller and their Affiliates
and Purchaser shall cooperate so that, effective as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time, (i) the account balances (whether positive or
negative) (the "Transferred FSA Balances") under the Seller FSAs of the
Affected Employees who are participants in the Seller FSAs (the "Covered
Employees") shall be transferred to one or more comparable plans of the
Purchaser (collectively, the "Purchaser Flex Plan"); (ii) the elections,
contribution levels and coverage levels of the Covered Employees shall apply
under the Purchaser Flex Plan in the same manner as under the Seller FSAs;
and (iii) the Covered Employees shall be reimbursed from the Purchaser Flex
Plan for claims incurred at any time during    39  the plan year of the
Seller Flex Plan in which the Closing Date occurs and submitted to the
Purchaser Flex Plan after the Closing Date substantially on the same basis,
terms and conditions as under the Seller FSAs. As soon as practicable after
the Closing Date, and in any event within 60 Business Days after the amount
of the Transferred FSA Balances is determined, (A) Seller and their
Affiliates shall pay Purchaser the net aggregate amount of the
Transferred FSA Balances, if such amount is positive, and (B) Purchaser shall
pay Seller and their Affiliates the net aggregate amount of the Transferred
FSA Balances, if such amount is negative.   (f) Employees Absent on
Disability or Leaves of Absence - Offer of Employment; Continued Employment;
Severance. When an Employee who is, on the Closing Date, absent for a reason
described in the first sentence of Section 7.5(a) seeks to return to active
employment within any deadline imposed by Seller or applicable Law, Purchaser
shall offer employment to such Employee in the same or a comparable position
to that which the Employee occupied before such absence but only at such time
that the Employee is capable of performing the essential functions of the
position occupied immediately before such absence. In addition, immediate
employment in the same (or, where permissible under the statute to which
leave was taken, comparable) positions will be offered to those Employees
returning from authorized leaves of absence such as parental, family and
medical, and military leaves or other leaves where return to work is subject
to statutory requirements. Until Purchaser is required under this Section
7.5(f) to offer employment to an Employee who is subject to Section 7.5(f)
such Employee shall remain an employee of the Seller.   (i) Purchaser\'s
offer of employment on the Closing Date to any Employee may be conditioned in
the offer letter to such Employee on such Employee being legally able to
commence active employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates. Purchaser
and Seller shall use reasonable efforts to enable any such Employee to
commence active employment with Purchaser as soon as practicable following
the Closing Date.   (g) No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as expressly
provided herein, nothing contained herein, expressed or implied, is intended
to confer upon any Employee of Seller any benefits under any benefit plans,
programs, policies or other arrangements, including, but not limited to,
severance benefits or right to employment or continued employment with
Purchaser for any period by reason of this Agreement. In addition, the
provisions of this Agreement, in particular this Section 7.5, are for the
sole benefit of the Parties to this Agreement and are not for the benefit of
any third party.   (h) No Duplication of Benefits. Neither the Purchaser,
the Seller, nor any of their Affiliates (or their successors) shall be
required to take any actions hereunder that would result in duplication of
the benefits with respect to any Affected Employee.   Section 7.6. Bulk
Transfer Laws. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller has not taken, and does not
intend to take, any action required to comply with any applicable bulk sale
or bulk transfer laws or similar laws. Seller shall indemnify and hold
Purchaser harmless, pursuant to Section 8.2, against and in respect of any
Losses arising from applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer laws or similar
laws.    40   Section 7.7. Compliance with WARN, Etc. Purchaser shall be
solely responsible for compliance with any notice obligations under the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN Act"), 29 U.S.C.
ss.2101 et seq. (and/or all state and local analogues of said Act) arising
from its failure to hire and retain any of the Employees that it is required
to hire pursuant to Section 7.5. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller
harmless, pursuant to Section 8.2, against and in respect of any Losses
arising from its failure to hire any of the Employees that Purchaser is
obligated to hire hereunder or arising from any action resulting in
employment loss of any such Employees on or after the Effective Time. Seller

the WARN Act (and all state and local analogues of said Act) arising from any
action resulting in employment loss of any Employees prior to the Effective
Time; and Seller shall indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless, pursuant to
Section 8.2 hereof, for any claims arising from any action resulting in
employment loss of any Employees prior to the Effective Time or arising from

any Employee that Purchaser is not required to hire hereunder.   Section
7.8. Insurance. As of the Closing Date, the coverage under all insurance
policies related to the Business shall continue in force only for the benefit
of Seller and its Affiliates and not for the benefit of Purchaser. Purchaser
agrees to arrange for its own insurance policies with respect to the Business
covering all periods and agrees not to seek, through any means, to benefit
from any of Seller\'s or its Affiliates\' insurance policies which
may provide coverage for claims relating in any way to the Business on or
prior to the Closing Date.   Section 7.9. Names and Logo. Except as
provided in the IP Agreement, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to revise
product literature, change signage and stationery, and discontinue the use of
any name or logo set forth in Section 2.3(h).   Section 7.10. Covenant Not
to Compete; Confidentiality; Exclusivity. (a) Seller agrees that, during the
four year period immediately following the Closing, Seller shall not,
directly or indirectly, engage in, or have any financial or other interest
in, or manage or operate, or provide or arrange any financing for any Person
or business (whether as director, officer, employee, agent, representative,
security holder, equity owner, partner, member, consultant or otherwise) that
engages in the business of developing, producing, manufacturing, have-
manufacturing, marketing or sale of chip sets for the wireless networking
market (other than the wide area networking market) (a "Competing Business"),
unless Purchaser ceases to operate the Business in its entirety and such
cessation does not result from a sale, transfer or disposition of the
Business by Purchaser; provided, however, that it shall not be a violation of
this Section 7.10 for Seller or any of its Affiliates (i) to own, directly or
indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any Person that are traded
on a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market (or a recognized
securities exchange outside the United States) if Seller or any of its
Affiliates (x) is not a controlling Person or a member of a group
that controls such Person and (y) does not, directly or indirectly, own 10%
or more of the voting securities of such Person, (ii) to directly or
indirectly acquire any Person, provided that not more than 25% of the
revenues of such acquired Person for the twelve months preceding the
acquisition were derived from a Competing Business and provided that the
Seller disposes of such Competing Business within twelve months after the
closing date of such acquisition, or (iii) to continue operating existing
lines of business, other than the Business, or any of the Excluded Assets;
and provided further, however, that    41  notwithstanding the foregoing
Seller\'s obligations and liabilities under this Section 7.10(a) shall
automatically terminate upon the consummation of a transaction pursuant to
which a transferee or successor of Seller owns more than a majority of the
voting power of Seller or all or substantially all of the assets of Seller
immediately following the consummation of such transaction; and further,
provided that such transferee or successor may not use any of
the Intellectual Property included in the Conveyed Assets or licensed by
Purchaser to Seller or licensed by Seller to Purchaser under the IP Agreement
to assist the conduct of a Competing Business.   (b) For a period of two
years from and after the Closing Date, neither Party nor any of its
respective Affiliates will recruit, solicit, lure or entice away, or in any
other manner persuade or attempt to persuade to leave the employ of the other
Party hereto any Person who is an employee of the other Party either on the
date hereof or who subsequently becomes an employee of such other Party
during such two-year period. For a period of one year from and after the
Closing Date, neither Party hereto nor any of its Affiliates will employ
or engage as a consultant any Person who is an employee of the other Party
either on the date hereof or who subsequently becomes an employee of such
other Party during such one-year period; provided, however, that this
sentence shall not apply to any Person whose employment by a Party was
terminated as a result of a layoff or reduction in force by such Party. If a
Party is acquired by another Person, this Section 7.10(b) shall not restrict
the actions of such other Person and shall only be applicable to such Party.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.10(b) to the contrary, each Party
agrees to consider any request by the other Party that an employee of the
other Party be permitted to transfer employment and become an employee of the
Considering Party.   (c) Seller acknowledges and agrees that, to the extent
the Conveyed Assets included information concerning the Business which had
been previously delivered by Seller to Purchaser prior to the Closing
("Confidential Information"), such Confidential Information effective at the
Closing will be acquired by Purchaser and will become the property of
Purchaser. During the five year period immediately following the Closing,
neither Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller shall disclose any Confidential
Information to any person or entity for any reason or purpose whatsoever
other than to Purchaser, nor shall Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller make
use of any Confidential Information for its own benefit or for the benefit of
any other Person or entity unless the prior written consent to such
disclosure or use is obtained from Purchaser. The foregoing restriction shall
not apply to any disclosure of Confidential Information to the extent that
(i) such Confidential Information subsequently becomes publicly available
without breach of any obligation of confidentiality, (ii) such Confidential
Information becomes available to Seller or its Affiliates on a non-
confidential basis from a third party that is, to the Knowledge of Seller or
its Affiliates, not bound by a confidentiality agreement with or subject to
any obligation nor duty of confidentiality; (iii) such disclosure is required
by applicable law or any rule, regulation or order of any
Governmental Authority or in connection with any litigation, provided that
Seller or its Affiliates shall provide Purchaser with prompt notice of any
such order prior to disclosure so that appropriate protective orders may be
sought.   (d) If the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Section 7.10 is
invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability will have the power to reduce
the scope,    42  duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement will be enforceable as so modified
after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be
appealed.   Section 7.11. Further Assurances. At any time after the date
hereof, Seller and Purchaser shall promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver
any other assurances or documents reasonably requested by Seller or
Purchaser, as the case may be, and necessary for Seller or Purchaser, as the
case may be, to satisfy its obligations hereunder.   Section 7.12. Books
and Records. Seller and Purchaser agree that from and after the Closing, each
Party shall make available to the other Party (at that Party\'s expense),
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, and subject to any
applicable privileges, the Party\'s respective books and records, but only to
the extent that such books and records pertain to (a) any Taxes owed to a
taxing authority or information necessary to complete a Tax Return,
(b) compliance with reporting, filing or other requirements related to the
conduct of the business imposed on such Party by a Governmental Authority or
taxing authority, or (c) the assertion or defense of any claims or
allegations in any arbitration, administrative or legal proceeding related to
the conduct of the Business other than claims or allegations which one Party
to the Agreement has asserted against the other. Notwithstanding the above,
all books and records that pertain exclusively to the Acquired Companies,
Affected Employees, Business, Conveyed Assets, and Equipment shall belong to
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall take possession of said books and records
within 180 days of the Closing. Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate with each other with respect to whether any such books and records
may be kept in Seller\'s facility as maintained in the normal course of
business.   Section 7.13. Certain Tax Matters.   (a) SiCom and Choice-
Intersil shall continue to be included for all taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date in the consolidated federal income Tax Return for the
affiliated group of corporations of which Seller is the common parent and all
Tax Returns of other consolidated, combined or unitary groups of corporations
of which SiCom or Choice-Intersil were a member prior to the date hereof in
accordance with past practice (together the "Pre-Closing Consolidated
Returns").   (b) Following the Closing, Seller shall have sole
responsibility for the preparation and filing of all Pre-Closing Consolidated
Returns and all other income Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for all
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date (together the "Pre-
Closing Tax Returns"). Seller shall prepare and timely file the Pre-Closing
Tax Returns and shall timely pay all Taxes required to be paid with respect
to such Pre-Closing Tax Returns ("Pre-Closing Taxes"). Seller shall submit
all such Tax Returns (prepared, in the case of Pre-Closing Consolidated
Returns, on a pro forma basis) to Purchaser for review at least 15 days prior
to filing. All such Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance
with past practice unless otherwise required under applicable law.   (c)
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all Tax sharing agreements,
arrangements and policies that may exist between the Acquired Companies and
the Seller and any of its affiliates shall terminate as of the Closing and
shall have no further effect for any taxable year.   (d) Purchaser and
Seller shall reasonably cooperate with each other, following the Closing, in
connection with the preparation of all Tax Returns with respect to the
Business and the Acquired Companies and with respect to any tax audit or
investigation related to the Business or the Acquired Companies. Purchaser
and Seller shall retain, until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitation period (including any extensions thereof) copies of all Tax
Returns and other records relating to Tax Periods or portions thereof ending
on or prior to the Closing Date.   Section 7.14. Conveyance Taxes. Purchaser
and Seller shall be responsible and liable for and shall indemnify and hold
the other harmless against one half of any realty transfer, sales, use,
transfer, value added, stamp, duty and other similar Taxes, and any transfer,
recording, registration and other fees which become payable in connection
with or by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
("Conveyance Taxes"). Purchaser, after reasonable review and comment by
Seller shall file such applications and documents as shall permit any such
Tax to be assessed and paid on or prior to the Closing Date in
accordance with any available pre-sale filing procedures. Seller shall
execute and deliver all instruments and certificates reasonably necessary to
enable Purchaser to comply with the foregoing. Purchaser shall timely
complete and execute any available resale or other exemption certificates
with respect to the inventory or other items sold hereunder, and shall
provide Seller with executed copies thereof. Purchaser and Seller shall
cooperate with each other in taking any and all actions reasonably designed
to minimize the amount of Conveyance Taxes that may be incurred in connection
with the transaction.   Section 7.15. Preparation of Notice Materials;
Registration Statement.   (a) As promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement, Purchaser shall prepare and file with the California
Department of Corporations the documents required to qualify the offer and
issuance of the Equity Consideration by Purchaser in connection with this
Agreement under a permit under Section 25121 of the California Corporations
Code and for the approval of the terms and conditions of the issuance of the
Equity Consideration pursuant to this Agreement, and the fairness of such
terms and conditions, by the Commissioner pursuant to a Hearing, including an
application for such permit (the "Permit Application"), a request for such
hearing (the "Hearing Request"), a notice of such hearing (the "Hearing
Notice") and all required or appropriate associated documents (collectively,
with the Permit Application, the Hearing Request and the Hearing Notice, the
"Notice Materials"), in order to perfect the exemption from registration
provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act. Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such permit and approval (the
"Permit") as promptly as practicable, including responding to any comments
from the California Department of Corporations and causing its respective
officers and other appropriate representatives to participate in the Hearing;
provided, that Purchaser shall not be required to modify any terms of this
Agreement in order to cause the Commissioner to approve the fairness of such
terms and conditions. Purchaser shall notify Seller promptly of the
receipt    44  of any comments from the Commissioner or its staff and of
any request by the Commissioner or its staff or any other government
officials for amendments or supplements to any of the documents filed with
the Permit Application or any other filing or for additional information and
shall supply Seller with copies of all correspondence between Purchaser or
any of its representatives and the Commissioner or its staff (or any other
governmental officials) with respect to the filing. Whenever any event occurs
that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Hearing
Notice, Permit Application or any other filing, Purchaser shall promptly
inform Seller of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the
Commissioner or its staff or any other government officials such amendment or
supplement. Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply
with any applicable securities or "blue sky" Laws in connection with the
issuance of the Equity Consideration pursuant to this Agreement. Seller shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist Purchaser as may be
necessary to comply with such applicable securities and "blue sky" Laws in
connection with the issuance of the Equity Consideration pursuant to this
Agreement. Seller shall promptly provide all information relating to Seller,
as applicable, necessary, or as reasonably requested by Purchaser, for
inclusion in the Notice Materials to satisfy the requirements of all
applicable securities Laws and shall cause its counsel and auditors
to cooperate with Purchaser\'s counsel and auditors in preparation of the
Notice Materials. Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to the Notice Materials, Purchaser will
promptly inform Seller in writing of such occurrence and cooperate in
preparing and mailing to the California Department of Corporations, if
required, any such amendment or supplement.   (b) In the event that the
Commissioner or its staff denies the request for the Hearing, or the Hearing
does not result in the issuance of a Permit by the Commissioner, Purchaser
shall, as promptly as practicable after it receives notice from the
Commissioner that a Permit will not be issued as a result of the Permit
Application (and in any event within 45 days after such notice), prepare and
file the Registration Statement with the SEC. Purchaser will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after filing
with the SEC. Purchaser shall notify Seller promptly upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government officials and
of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials
for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the prospectus
included in the Registration Statement (the "Prospectus") or for additional
information, and will supply Seller with copies of all correspondence between
Purchaser or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its
staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to
the Registration Statement or the Prospectus. Whenever any event occurs that
is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Prospectus
or the Registration Statement, Purchaser shall promptly inform Seller of such
occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff or any other
governmental officials such amendment or supplement.   (c) Purchaser shall
cause such executive or executives as Seller reasonably requests (including,
if so requested, Purchaser\'s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer) to attend any analyst group meetings, one-on-one meetings and other
investment preparations to facilitate the distribution of the Equity
Consideration, including but not limited to any "roadshow" meetings, for not
more than seven Business Days within 30 days following the Closing Date.
Purchaser shall bear all costs associated with any such activities.   
45   Section 7.16. Stock Interest. Prior to the Closing, Choice-Intersil
will divest its Equity Interest in Intersil Americas to an Affiliate of
Seller or other person. Purchaser acknowledges that such Equity Interest in
Intersil Americas is not a Conveyed Asset.   Section 7.17. **.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or the IP Agreement to the
contrary, with respect to the action titled **, pending in the ** (the "**")
and the action titled **, pending in the ** (the "**"):   (a) Promptly after

cause of action shall not count toward Purchaser\'s obligation to pay **.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the **;

reimbursement obligation under this Section 7.17(g) shall not exceed an
amount equal to **. All Litigation Expenses incurred by Seller prior to the
Closing Date or relating to alleged infringement occurring prior to the
Closing Date are to be borne by Seller.   Section 7.18. Transition
Services. Prior to the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in good
faith to determine the services to be provided by Seller to Purchaser
pursuant to Exhibit A of the Transition Services Agreement (collectively, the
"Transition Services"). Seller and Purchaser agree that services shall be in
the categories of information technology, operations, finance (including
accounts receivable and accounts payable), purchasing services and foundry
support, completion of UHF2 production, tests and reliability, human
resources and payroll, scheduling and operations planning and any other
categories of services mutually agreed upon by Seller and
Purchaser  ------------- ** This portion of the Agreement is omitted and
has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to a request for confidential treatment.   47  and further agree
that any Transition Service shall be terminable by Purchaser upon not less
than 30 days\' written notice to Seller. The Transition Services Agreement
shall also permit Purchaser to access and use approximately 49,376 square
feet in building 62 and 1,250 square feet in building 54 of Seller\'s
Palm Bay, Florida facility for up to 9 months from the Closing Date. Seller
and Purchaser agree that the Transition Services shall be billed monthly at a
rate equal to Seller\'s full internal cost to provide them, determined in a
manner consistent with Seller\'s ordinary business practices prior to the
Closing.   Section 7.19. Seller\'s Conduct Pending Closing.   (a) From and
after the date hereof and to the Closing, neither Seller nor any Affiliate
controlled by Seller shall offer to sell, contract to sell, or otherwise
sell, dispose of, loan pledge or grant any rights (whether by actual
disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement
or otherwise) (collectively, a "Disposition") with respect to any shares
of Purchaser Common Stock, any options or warrants to purchase any shares
of Purchaser Common Stock (collectively, "Securities") now owned or
hereafter acquired directly by Seller or any Affiliate controlled by Seller
or with respect to which the Seller has or hereafter acquires the power of
disposition. The foregoing restrictions have been expressly agreed to
preclude Seller or any Affiliate controlled by Seller from engaging in any
hedging or other transaction which is designed to or reasonably expected to
lead to or result in a Disposition of Securities from and after the date
hereof and to the Closing, even if such Securities would be disposed of by
someone other than the Seller or any Affiliate controlled by Seller.   (b)
Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller shall not,
and shall cause its officers, directors, employees, agents, Affiliates or
advisors not to (all such persons and entities, together with Seller, the
"Seller Group"), initiate, solicit, encourage, entertain, negotiate, accept
or discuss, directly or indirectly, any proposal or offer (an "Acquisition
Proposal") to acquire, directly or indirectly, all or any significant part of
the Business or any of the Acquired Companies, whether by merger, purchase of
stock, purchase of assets or otherwise or provide any non-public information
to any third party in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or enter into
any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring it to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the transaction proposed hereby.   ARTICLE
VIII.  SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION   Section 8.1. Survival; Knowledge of
Breach.   (a) The representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement and the Exhibits hereto, shall survive the Closing until April
1, 2005, except that (i) the representations and warranties contained in
Section 5.16 (Taxes) shall survive the Closing until 60 days after the
expiration of the relevant statute of limitations applicable to claims made
under Laws applicable to any such breached representation and warranty; (ii)
the first and second sentences of Section 5.1 (Organization and
Qualification) and the representations and warranties contained in Section
6.1 (Organization and Qualification), the representations and warranties
contained in Sections 5.19    48  and 6.11 (Brokers), and the first
sentence of Section 5.12 (Assets) shall survive the Closing indefinitely; and
(iii) the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.11
(Intellectual Property) shall survive the Closing until the fourth
anniversary thereof. The covenants contained in this Agreement shall survive
the Closing until the fifth anniversary thereof; provided, however, that any
covenants relating to Taxes shall survive until 60 days after the expiration
of the relevant statute of limitations applicable to claims made under Laws
applicable to any such covenant. No claim may be made or suit instituted
seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2 for any breaches
or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty unless a written notice
describing such breach or inaccuracy in reasonable detail is provided to an
Indemnifying Party within the survival periods set forth in this Section
8.1(a).   (b) The right to indemnification, payment of damages or
other remedy based on the representations, warranties and covenants in this
Agreement will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect
to, or any knowledge acquired at any time, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to
the accuracy or inaccuracy or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty or covenant. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of
any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with
any covenant, will not affect the right to indemnification, payment of
damages or other remedy based on a breach of such representation, warranty or
covenant.   Section 8.2. Indemnification.   (a) From and after the Closing
Date and subject to Sections 8.1 and 8.4, Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
representatives, agents and stockholders against and in respect of any and
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, reasonable costs and expenses,
including reasonable legal fees and expenses and costs of investigation as
such legal fees and expenses and costs of investigation are incurred
("Losses"), resulting or arising from or otherwise relating to (i)
any breaches of Seller\'s representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement and the Exhibits hereto, or in the certificates contemplated by
Sections 4.2(a) and 4.2(d), (ii) any nonfulfillment of or failure to comply
with any covenant set forth in this Agreement by Seller, or (iii) any
Retained Liability; provided that Seller shall not be required to indemnify
Purchaser for any Loss to the extent of any reserve against such specific
Loss that was reflected as a current liability on the Closing Date Balance
Sheet.   (b) From and after the Closing Date and subject to Sections
8.1 and 8.4, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents and
stockholders against and in respect of any and all Losses resulting or
arising from or otherwise relating to (i) any breaches of Purchaser\'s
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement and the Exhibits
hereto, or in the certificates contemplated by Section 4.3(a), (ii) any
nonfulfillment of or failure to comply with any covenant set forth in this
Agreement by Purchaser, (iii) the operation of the Business or the Conveyed
Assets or actions taken by or on behalf of Purchaser after the Closing, or
(iv) any Assumed Liability.   (c) In any case where Purchaser is indemnified
by Seller for a claim of Intellectual Property infringement by a Third Party,
and where Seller has undertaken to defend the action brought by the Third
Party, Purchaser shall provide reasonable cooperation to Seller in the
Seller\'s defense, conduct and    49  compromise of the litigation with
the Third Party. Seller shall grant Purchaser sufficient right to assert any
Type 1 or Type 3 Patent, as such terms are defined in the IP Agreement, that
Purchaser determines to assert against the Third Party in the litigation.
Seller shall provide Purchaser the right to grant to a Third Party a non-
exclusive license to any Type 1 or Type 3 Patent involved in the litigation
as part of a settlement or compromise of the litigation.   (d) Any payments
pursuant to this Article VIII shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.   Section 8.3. Method of Asserting Claims, etc. All claims
for indemnification by any Indemnified Party hereunder shall be asserted
and resolved as set forth in this Section 8.3.   (a) In the event that any
written claim or demand for which an Indemnifying Party would be liable to
any Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected
from any Indemnified Party by a third party, such Indemnified Party shall
promptly, but in no event more than 15 days following such Indemnified
Party\'s receipt of such claim or demand, notify the Indemnifying Party of
such claim or demand and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the
extent then feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final
amount of such claim and demand) (the "Claim Notice"). Failure to give the
Claim Notice in accordance with the foregoing terms shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party has suffered actual prejudice thereby. The Indemnifying
Party shall have 30 days from the receipt of the Claim Notice (the "Notice
Period") to notify the Indemnified Party whether or not it desires to defend
the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand. An election to assume the
defense of such claim or demand shall not be deemed to be an admission
that the Indemnifying Party is liable to the Indemnified Party in respect of
such claim or demand. All costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying
Party in defending such claim or demand shall be a liability of, and shall be
paid by, the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that the amount of such
expenses shall be a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder, subject to
the limitations set forth in this Article VIII. In the event that it is
ultimately determined that the Indemnifying Party is not obligated to
indemnify, defend or hold the Indemnified Party harmless from and against any
third party claim, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying
Party for any and all costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
attorney\'s fees and court costs) incurred by the Indemnifying Party in its
defense of the third party claim. In the event that the Indemnifying Party
notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it desires to
defend, or permit a Permitted Designee to defend, the Indemnified Party
against such claim or demand, except as hereinafter provided, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party by
appropriate proceedings. If any Indemnified Party desires to participate in
any such defense or settlement for which the Indemnifying Party has elected,
pursuant to the prior sentence to defend, or permit its Permitted Designee to
defend, the Indemnified Party may do so at its sole cost and expense. The
Indemnified Party shall not settle a claim or demand without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed unless the settlement shall adversely affect the
operations of the Indemnified Party and such adverse effect is not reasonably
quantified and indemnified by Indemnifying Party in which case the written
consent of the Indemnified Party may be withheld or delayed in
the Indemnified Party\'s sole discretion. The Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not
be    50  unreasonably withheld or delayed, settle, compromise or offer
to settle or compromise any such claim or demand on a basis which would
result in the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would
restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
defend the Indemnified Party against a claim or demand for which the
Indemnifying Party has an indemnification obligation hereunder, whether by
not giving the Indemnified Party timely notice as provided above or
otherwise, then the amount of any such claim or demand, or, if the same shall
be contested by the Indemnified Party, then that portion thereof as to which
such contest is unsuccessful (and the reasonable costs and expenses
pertaining to such contest) shall be the liability of the Indemnifying Party
hereunder, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII. To the
extent the Indemnifying Party shall control or participate in the defense or
settlement of any third party claim or demand, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party, its counsel and any Permitted Designee (with
respect to any liability for which the Indemnifying Party may have an
indemnity claim pursuant to any agreement it had made with such Permitted
Designee as in effect as of the date hereof), access to, during normal
business hours, the property and relevant business records and
other documents, and shall permit them to consult with the employees and
counsel of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts in the defense of all such claims. Any notice
of a claim by reason of any of the representations, warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement shall state specifically the representation,
warranty, or covenant with respect to which the claim is made, the facts
giving rise to an alleged basis for the claim, and the amount of the
liability asserted against the Indemnifying Party by reason of the claim.  
Section 8.4. Indemnification Amounts. No Indemnifying Party shall
have liability under Sections 8.2(a)(i) or 8.2(b)(i) until the aggregate
amount of Losses to an Indemnified Party exceeds two percent (2%) of the
Purchase Price Value (the "Basket Amount"), in which case the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to be indemnified for all Losses in an amount up to
thirty percent (30%) of the Purchase Price Value (the "Cap") in the
aggregate; provided, however, that any amounts paid by Seller pursuant to its
obligations to indemnify Purchaser under Section 7.17 (**) shall not reduce
Seller\'s indemnification obligation under such thirty percent (30%) Cap.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cap shall equal one hundred percent (100%)
of the Purchase Price Value less the aggregate payments made at any time by
Seller under this Article VIII in connection with its liability (x) under
Section 8.1(a)(i) solely with respect to the representations and warranties
contained in Section 5.16 (Taxes) and (y) Seller\'s obligations to indemnify
Purchaser under Section 7.17. Except as otherwise provided for in Section
8.6, neither Party shall have liability under this Article VIII in any event
in excess of one hundred percent (100%) of the Purchase Price Value.  
Section 8.5. Losses Net of Insurance, Etc. The amount of any Loss for
which indemnification is provided under Section 8.2 will reflect (i) the
present value (at a discount rate equal to the prime rate as published in The
Wall Street Journal) of the Tax benefit available to be taken by the
Indemnified Party for United States federal and state income tax purposes in
the year in which such Loss is suffered or incurred and which is determined
by the applicable Indemnified Party\'s tax return preparers to be without
material risk of being disallowed on audit and (ii) the amount of any
insurance proceeds or other reimbursement received in cash by the Indemnified
Party in respect of such Loss in such year, net of the present value of any
increase in insurance premiums  ------------- ** This portion of the

by such Indemnified Party in recovering such proceeds from its insurers.  
Section 8.6. Sole Remedy/Waiver. The Parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that, in the absence of fraud or intentional misrepresentation, the
remedies provided for in this Agreement shall be the Parties\' sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement;
provided, that the foregoing shall not be construed as limiting in any way
the right of a Party to seek injunctive relief in accordance with Section
10.13. Any claims Purchaser may have for breach of representation or warranty
shall be based solely on the representations and warranties of Seller set
forth in Article V.   Section 8.7. No Punitive Damages. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, no Indemnifying Party shall be
liable to or otherwise responsible to any Indemnified Party for punitive
damages that arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the performance or
breach thereof or any liability retained or assumed hereunder.   Section
8.8. Mitigation of Damages. The Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable
steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event that would
reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including
incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the breach or
other occurrence which gives rise to the Loss.   Section 8.9. No Set-Off.
Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall have any right to set-off any Losses
against any payments to be made by either of them pursuant to this Agreement
or otherwise.   ARTICLE IX.  TERMINATION   Section 9.1. Termination. This
Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:   (a) by
written agreement of Seller and Purchaser;   (b) by either Seller or
Purchaser, by giving written notice of such termination to the other Party,
if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to December 31, 2003
(unless the failure to consummate the Closing by such date shall be due to
the failure of the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement to have
fulfilled any of its obligations under this Agreement);   (c) by either
Seller or Purchaser if any court of competent jurisdiction or other competent
Governmental Authority shall have issued a statute, rule, regulation, order,
decree or injunction or taken any other action permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such statute, rule, regulation, order, decree or injunction or
other action shall have become final and nonappealable;   (d) by Purchaser
if either (i) there has been a breach of any representation or warranty of
Seller with respect to representations and warranties that are qualified by
materiality or a material breach of any representation or warranty of Seller
with respect to representations and    52  warranties that are not
qualified by materiality, contained in this Agreement as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any subsequent date (other than representations or
warranties that expressly speak only as of a specific date or time, with
respect to which Purchaser\'s right to terminate will arise only in the event
of a breach of such representation or warranty as of such specified date or
time), or (ii) Seller has breached in any material respect any of
its covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach would
give rise or could reasonably be expected to give rise, to a failure of a
condition set forth in Section 4.2 and has not been cured on or before the
earlier of five Business Days before the Closing Date or ten Business Days
after Purchaser notifies Seller of such breach; and   (e) by Seller if
either (i) there has been a breach of any representation or warranty of
Purchaser with respect to representations and warranties that are qualified
by materiality or a material breach of any representation or warranty of
Purchaser with respect to representations and warranties that are not
qualified by materiality, contained in this Agreement as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any subsequent date (other than representations or
warranties that expressly speak only as of a specific date or time, with
respect to which the Seller\'s right to terminate will arise only in the
event of a breach of such representation or warranty as of such
specified date or time), or (ii) Purchaser has breached in any material
respect any of its covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement,
which breach would give rise or could reasonably be expected to give rise, to
a failure of a condition set forth in Section 4.3 and has not been cured on
or before the earlier of five Business Days before the Closing Date or ten
Business Days after Seller notifies Purchaser of such breach.   Section
9.2.Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Section 9.1, this Agreement shall thereafter become void

case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No

Assignment. No Party to this Agreement may assign any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement including by sale of stock, operation of law
in connection with a merger or sale of substantially all the assets of such

the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other than Seller,

be construed to give any Person, other than the parties and such successors
and assignees, any legal or equitable rights hereunder.   Section 10.7.
Public Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of
the Parties to this Agreement hereby agrees with the other Party hereto that,
except as may be required to comply with the requirements of any applicable
Laws, and the rules and regulations of each stock exchange upon which the

by the Party incurring such expenses.   Section 10.11. Schedules. Neither
the listing nor description of any item, matter or document in any Schedule
hereto nor the furnishing or availability for review of any document will be
construed to modify, qualify or disclose an exception to any representation
or warranty of any party made herein, except to the extent that such
representation or warranty specifically refers to such Schedule and such
modification, qualification or exception is clearly described in such
Schedule or the applicability of such modification or qualification
or exception is reasonably apparent from the description contained in

GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW

TO ANY SUIT OR ACTION ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS

OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SELLER

JURY TRIAL AS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO SELLER TO ENTER INTO THIS

undertaking, the other party will be    56  entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in
any action instituted pursuant to Section 10.12 in addition to any other
remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity. Each party further
agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect
of such breach or violation, it will not assert that the defense that
a remedy at law would be adequate.   Section 10.14. Counterparts. This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and the same
agreement.   Section 10.15. Headings. The heading references herein and the

the provisions hereof.   Section 10.16. Severability. The provisions of
this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or entity or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid
or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons, entities or circumstances
shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such
invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such
provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.
