Period, (i) the Contingent Payment Transferred Client Accounts, (ii) the

payable to the Sellers, if any, prepared in accordance with and on a basis
consistent with _Exhibit A_.

 



-15- (b) Upon receipt from the Sellers, the Buyer shall have 30 days to
review the Contingent Payment Statement (the "Review Period"). At the Buyers
request, the Sellers (i) shall reasonably cooperate and assist, and, if
applicable, shall cause their respective Affiliates and Agents to
reasonably cooperate and assist, the Buyer and its Agents in their review of
the Contingent Payment Statement and (ii) shall provide the Buyer and its
Agents with any information reasonably requested by the Buyer that is
necessary for its review of the Contingent Payment Statement. If the Buyer
disagrees with the Contingent Payment Statement, the Buyer shall, on or prior
to the last day of the Review Period, deliver a written notice to the Sellers
(the "Notice of Objection") setting forth (A) the Buyers objections to the
Contingent Payment Statement (collectively, the "Disputed Items") and (B) the
Buyers alternative calculations of the Disputed Items based on such
objections.

 

(c) If the Buyer does not deliver a Notice of Objection to the Sellers
within the Review Period, (i) the Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted the
Sellers calculations in the Contingent Payment Statement and such
calculations shall be final, conclusive and binding and (ii) within five
Business Days after the last day of the Review Period, the Buyer shall pay to
the Sellers, an amount equal to the Contingent Payment as set forth in the
Contingent Payment Statement delivered by the Sellers to the Buyer pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.9(a)_.

 

(d) If the Buyer delivers a Notice of Objection to the Sellers within the
Review Period, the Sellers and the Buyer shall, during the 30 days following
such delivery or any mutually agreed extension thereof, use their good faith
efforts to reach agreement on the Disputed Items; _provided_ that any items or
amounts not being disputed (the "Undisputed Items") shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Buyer and the Sellers. If, at the end of such
period or any mutually agreed extension thereof, the Buyer and the Sellers are
unable to resolve their disagreements, they shall jointly retain and refer
their disagreements to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm
that is not the primary auditor of either the Buyer or the Sellers and that is
mutually acceptable to the Buyer and the Sellers, which agreement shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (the "Independent Expert").
The Independent Expert shall act as independent accountants and not as
arbitrators. The parties shall instruct the Independent Expert promptly to
determine, solely with respect to the Disputed Items, whether and to what
extent, if any, the Contingent Payment Statement requires adjustment. The
Independent Expert shall base its determination solely on written submissions
by the Buyer and the Sellers and not on an independent review. The Buyer and
the Sellers shall make available to the Independent Expert all relevant books
and records and other items reasonably requested by the Independent Expert. As
promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 30 days after its
retention, the Independent Expert shall deliver to the Buyer and the Sellers a
report that sets forth its resolution of the Disputed Items and the amount of
the applicable payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Independent Expert
may not find the amount of the Contingent Payment to be greater than the
amount claimed by the Sellers or less than the amount claimed by the Buyer.
The decision of the Independent Expert shall be final, conclusive and binding
on the Buyer and the Sellers. The costs and expenses of the Independent
Expert shall be allocated between the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers,
on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of the contested
amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by
such party, as determined by the Independent Expert. The Buyer and the Sellers
agree to execute, if requested by the Independent Expert, a reasonable
engagement letter, including customary indemnities in favor of the
Independent Expert.

 



-16- (e) If a Notice of Objection is delivered by the Buyer in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 2.9(b)_, (i) within five Business Days after the delivery of
the Notice of Objection, the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers an amount equal to
the portion of the Contingent Payment, if any, based on the Undisputed
Items and (ii) within five Business Days after the final determination of the
Contingent Payment in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.9(d)_, the Buyer shall
pay to the Sellers, an amount equal to the additional portion of
the Contingent Payment, if any, based on the final resolution of the Disputed
Items.

(f) Any payment payable by the Buyer to the Sellers pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.9_ shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in Dollars to such account or accounts specified by the Sellers to the
Buyer at least one Business Day prior to such payment. The amount of any
payment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.9_ shall bear interest from and
including the date such payment is due in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
2.9_, to and including the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to 3%.
Such interest shall be calculated daily on the basis of a 360 day year and the
actual number of days elapsed.

 

 _SECTION_ __ _ 2.10._ _Non-Assignable and Non-Transferrable Purchased
Assets_. To the extent that the assignment or transfer hereunder by the
Sellers to the Buyer of any non-assignable or non-transferrable Purchased
Asset is not permitted without the consent (including any negative consents)
of any other party, this Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute an
assignment or transfer of such Purchased Asset if such consent is not given
or if such assignment or transfer otherwise would constitute a breach of, or
cause a loss of contractual benefits under or permit any Person to accelerate
any obligation or terminate, cancel or modify any right or obligation under,
any such Purchased Asset.

_SECTION_ __ _ 2.11._ _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Sellers and Buyer
shall work in good faith to prepare an allocation (the "Allocation") of the
purchase price as determined for tax purposes (and all other capitalized
costs) as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of the Conversion
Period among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision
of state, local, or non-U.S. Law, as appropriate). The Sellers shall deliver
the Allocation to Buyer as soon as reasonable practicable after the end of the
Conversion Period. The Allocation shall be revised as the purchase price
is revised pursuant to this Agreement. If the Sellers and the Buyer agree on
the Allocation, then the Sellers and the Buyer and their respective Affiliates
shall report, act, and file Tax Returns (including, but not limited to
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in all respects and for all purposes
consistent with the Allocation and neither the Sellers nor the Buyer shall
take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns, or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with the Allocation unless required to do so by applicable Law.
If the Sellers and the Buyer are unable to agree on the Allocation, then they
may report the allocation of the purchase price in a manner that is
inconsistent with each other.

 

 _SECTION_ __ _ 2.12._ _No Withholding for Sellers_. The Buyer and any
other applicable withholding agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration payable under this Agreement any withholding Taxes or
other amounts required under the Code or any applicable Law to be deducted and
withheld, provided that no amount shall be withheld on account of U.S.
federal income Tax if each Seller shall have delivered to the

 



-17-  Buyer a fully-executed true, complete and correct IRS Form W-9 certifying
that no backup withholding is required and the certificate described in 
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(c)(iii)_. To the extent any such amounts are so deducted
and withheld, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

such a violation or default under) any Forgivable Note. A copy of each
Forgivable Note has previously been made available to the Buyer. Each
Forgivable Note is a valid and binding agreement of the applicable Seller, and

the Sellers as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within 15
Business Days following the applicable event) of (a) any change in service
status, death or disability of any Transferred DCP Participant, and (b) the
occurrence of any event that may constitute a change in control event (within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)) of the Buyer with
respect to the Transferred DCP Participants, and by facilitating the Sellers
communications with Transferred DCP Participants regarding actions under the
Deferred Compensation Plans.

 



-28- (b) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement, express or implied, shall confer upon any employee, service
provider, Hired Employee, Transferred Seller Representative or other Person or
legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies of any
nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, no provision of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ will create
any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee, service provider, Hired
Employee, Transferred Seller Representative or any other Person in respect of
continued employment or service (or resumed employment or service) or any
other matter. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ is intended to amend any
compensation or incentive arrangement or to require the Buyer to continue any
arrangement of the Sellers, or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof.

 

 _SECTION_ __ _ 5.11._ _Bulk Sales Laws_. The parties hereby waive compliance
with the provisions of any bulk sales, bulk transfer or similar Laws of any
jurisdiction that may otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale of any
or all of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt, the
waiver set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ shall not apply to Laws
applicable to the transfer of the Seller Representatives contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

 _SECTION_ __ _ 5.12._ _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration, value added and other similar Taxes and fees
(including any penalties and interest) ("Transfer Taxes") incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne
and paid 50% by the Buyer and 50% by the Sellers when due. Each Party shall,
at its own expense, timely file any Tax Return or other document with respect
to such Taxes or fees (and the other Party shall cooperate with respect
thereto as necessary).

 

 _SECTION_ __ _ 5.13._ _Further Actions_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Buyer and the Sellers agrees to use their reasonable best efforts (except
where a different efforts standard is specifically contemplated by this
Agreement, in which case such different standard shall apply) to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing,
the Sellers and the Buyer shall commit those resources necessary to take all
such actions as FINRA may request to facilitate the Conversions and the
transfers of the Client Accounts.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at any time and
from time to time after the expiration of the Conversion Period, at a Partys
request and without further consideration, the other Parties shall execute and
deliver to such requesting Party such other instruments of sale, transfer,
conveyance, assignment and confirmation, provide such materials and
information and take such other actions as such Party may reasonably request
in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



-29- _SECTION_ __ _ 5.14._ _Intellectual Property Matters_. The Buyer, for
itself and its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that the Buyer is not
purchasing, acquiring or otherwise obtaining any right, title or interest in
or to any Intellectual Property owned or licensed by the Sellers or their
respective Affiliates or any other name or source identifiers related thereto
or employing such Intellectual Property or any derivation, translation or
variation thereof, or any confusingly similar (collectively, the "Seller
Intellectual Property"). Neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall (a)
have any rights in or to any Seller Intellectual Property or (b) (i) seek to
register in any jurisdiction any of the Seller Intellectual Property or any
derivation, translation, adaptation, combination or variation of the Seller
Intellectual Property or that is confusingly similar thereto, or (ii) contest
the use, ownership, validity or enforceability of any rights of the Sellers
or any of their respective Affiliates in or to any of Seller Intellectual
Property. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 5.14_, for a phase-out period not to exceed 90 days immediately
following the end of the Conversion Period or such shorter period as required
by applicable Law or Order (the "Phase-out Period"), the Buyer may continue
to use any Seller Intellectual Property, to the extent such Seller
Intellectual Property appears on or is incorporated in any tangible
materials acquired by the Buyer under this Agreement, in the same manner as
used by the Sellers prior to the end of the Conversion Period and solely as
necessary to wind down the use of, and transition away from, such Seller
Intellectual Property. At the end of the Phase-out Period, the Buyer and its
Affiliates shall have re-labeled, destroyed, replaced or exhausted all
materials bearing or incorporating the Seller Intellectual Property,
including signage, advertising, promotional materials, software, packaging,
inventory, electronic materials, collateral goods, stationery, business cards,
web sites, and other materials, so as to bring Buyer and its Affiliates into
compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_. Following the end of the Phase-out
Period, if the Sellers notify the Buyer of any incident of usage of Seller
Intellectual Property by the Buyer or its Affiliates in violation of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.14_, the Buyer shall (or shall cause its Affiliates to),
upon receipt of such notification, promptly destroy or re-label the relevant
materials incorporating the Seller Intellectual Property and shall certify
(pursuant to a certificate signed by an authorized officer of the Buyer) the
completion of such destruction or re-labeling. 

_SECTION_ __ _ 5.15._ ___Commissions and Fees_.

 

(a) If any Seller receives a payment of any commissions or fees relating to
any period following the applicable Conversion Date in respect of a
Transferred Client Account, the Seller shall remit such payment to the Buyer
as promptly as reasonably practicable following its receipt of such payment.

 

(b) If the Buyer receives a payment of any commissions or fees relating to
any period ending on or prior to the applicable Conversion Date in respect of
a Transferred Client Account, the Buyer shall remit such payment to the
applicable Seller as promptly as reasonably practicable following its receipt
of such payment.

 

 _SECTION_ __ _ 5.16._ _Exclusivity_. From and after the date of this
Agreement and until the end of the Conversion Period, Sellers shall not, and
shall not permit any of their Affiliates or Agents to, directly or indirectly,
(a) solicit, initiate or encourage the submission or any proposal or offer
from any Person or group (other than the Buyer or its Affiliates or Agents),
or enter into any agreement with respect to or consummate any transaction

 



-30-  with respect to transferring the affiliation of the Seller Representatives
or (b) participate in any discussion or negotiations with respect to, furnish
any information with respect to, assist or participate in, or facilitate in
any other manner any effort or attempt by any Person or group (other than the
Buyer or its Affiliates or Agents) to do or seek to do any of the foregoing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 5.16_ shall not apply to any Seller Representative who (i) is designated by
the Buyer as "excluded" on _Exhibit A_ (unless the Buyer subsequently removes
such designation in a written notice to Sellers no later than 45 days prior
to the applicable Conversion Date with respect to such Seller Representative)
or (ii) does not become affiliated with the Buyer or its Affiliates on or
prior to the last day of the Conversion Period. For the avoidance of doubt,
this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ shall not apply to any transfer of an account of a
client or customer of Sellers or its Affiliates or Agents, including the
transfer of any registered representative, or any person otherwise supervised
by any Seller or any of its Affiliates or Agents, in each case in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice (taking into account the
transactions contemplated hereby).

 

 _SECTION_ __ _ 5.17._ _Bank Relationshi_ _ps_. During the
Conversion Period, the Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to assist the Buyer in connection with establishing bank networking
relationships and referral arrangements relating to the Purchased Assets.

herein as the "Applicable Survival Period." In the event notice of a claim for
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ is
delivered in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.6_, as
the case may be, within the Applicable Survival Period, the representation or

_SECTION_ __ _ 6.2._  _Indemnification by the Sellers_.

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth herein, after the Closing,
the Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify and defend the Buyer
against, and shall hold the Buyer, its Agents and its Affiliates, and each of

loss, liability, claim, charge, action, suit, proceeding, assessed interest,
penalty, damage, Tax or expense (including reasonable attorneys fees)
(collectively, "Losses") suffered or incurred by or imposed on such Buyer
Indemnitee to the extent resulting from or arising out of (i) any breach of
any representation and warranty of the Sellers contained in _Article III_ of
this Agreement or the __ certificates delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.8(c)(ii)(C)_ (ii) any breach of the covenants or agreements of the Sellers
contained in this Agreement, and (iii) without duplication, any Excluded
Asset or Excluded Liability. In the event that the Sellers may be obligated to

this _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_, the Sellers obligations under subsection (iii)
shall be controlling.

(b) The Sellers shall not be liable for (i) any Loss or Losses unless the

Period, (ii) with respect to breaches of representations contained in
_Section_ __ _ 3.11_ (Taxes) for any taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning on or after the applicable Conversion Date and (iii) any Loss or
Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)(i)_ (other than with respect to the
Fundamental Representations to which the limitations in this _Section_ __ _
6.2(b)_ other than the Aggregate Cap shall not apply) unless and until (A) the
amount of Losses arising from any matter or series of matters relating to the
same underlying fact, circumstance, action or event exceeds $50,000 ("Covered
Losses") and (B) the aggregate amount of all Covered Losses incurred by the
Buyer Indemnitees exceeds $1,625,000 (the "Deductible"), and then only to the
extent that such Covered Losses exceed the Deductible; _provided_ that (A)
the cumulative indemnification obligations of the Sellers pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)(i)_ (other than with respect to the Fundamental
Representations to which the limitations in this _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_
other than the Aggregate Cap shall not apply) shall in no event exceed
$32,500,000 in the aggregate (the "10 % Cap"); and (B) the
cumulative indemnification obligations of the Sellers pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 6.2(a)(i)_ and _(ii)_ shall in no event exceed an amount equal to (1)
the Closing Payment _plus_ (2) the Contingent Payment actually received by
the Sellers pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.9(e)_ in the aggregate (the
"Aggregate Cap").

 



-32- (c) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.9_,  _Section_ __ _ 2.11_
and _Section_ __ _ 7.7_, the Buyer acknowledges and agrees that its and each
Buyer Indemnitees sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all
matters arising out of, relating to or connected with this Agreement, the
Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification

equitable remedies or intentional fraud.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the limitations set

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth herein, after Closing, the Buyer
shall indemnify and defend the Sellers, their respective Agents and
Affiliates, and each of the equityholders, heirs, executors, successors and
assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees")
against, and shall hold each Seller Indemnitee harmless from, any Loss
suffered or incurred by or imposed on such Seller Indemnitee to the extent
resulting from or arising out of (i) any breach of any representation and
warranty of the Buyer contained in Article IV of this Agreement or the _ _
certificates delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.8(c)(i)(B)_, (ii) any
breach of the covenants or agreements of the Buyer contained in this
Agreement, and (iii) without duplication, any Assumed Liability. In the

Period, and (ii) any Loss or Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)(i)_
(other than with respect to the Fundamental Representations to which the
limitations in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.4(b)_ other than the Aggregate Cap
shall not apply) unless and until (A) the Loss is a Covered Loss and (B) the

and _Section_ __ _ 7.7_, the Sellers acknowledge and agree that its and each
Seller Indemnitees sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all
matters arising out of, relating to or connected with this Agreement shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article VI_ ;
_provided_ that the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)_ shall not apply
in the case of a claim for equitable remedies or intentional fraud.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the limitations
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.4(b)_ shall not, in any event, apply to a
claim brought pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)(iii)_.

 

 _SECTION_ __ _ 6.5._ _Indemnification Procedures for Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) In the event that any claim or demand, or other circumstance or state
of facts that could give rise to any claim or demand, for which an Indemnitor
may be liable to an Indemnitee hereunder is asserted or sought to be
collected, in each case, in writing, by a third party (each, a "Third Party
Claim"), the Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Indemnitor in writing of
such Third Party Claim (each, a "Notice of Claim"); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that a failure by an Indemnitee to provide timely notice shall not affect the
rights or obligations of such Indemnitee other than if the Indemnitor shall
have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. The Notice of Claim
shall (i) state that the Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued Losses or
anticipates that it will incur liability for Losses for which such Indemnitee
is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) specify in
reasonable detail each individual item of Loss included in the amount so
stated, the date such item was paid or properly accrued, the basis for any
anticipated Loss and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty,
breach of covenant or claim to which each such item is related and the
computation of the amount to which such Indemnitee claims to be entitled
hereunder  _provided_ , _however_ , that a failure by an Indemnitee to
include information that is incomplete or unknown shall not affect the rights
of the Indemnitee or the obligations of the Indemnitor other than if the
Indemnitor shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.
The Indemnitee shall enclose with the Notice of Claim copies of all papers
served and received by it with respect to such Third Party Claim, if any, and
copies of any other documents received by it that evidence such Third Party
Claim.

(b) The Indemnitor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to,
within twenty Business Days after the Indemnitees compliance with _Section_
__ _ 6.5(a)_, assume the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim and
any litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice and at its
sole cost and expense (a "Third Party Defense"); _provided_ that the
Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim
to the extent that (i) such Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or
other equitable relief against any Indemnitee or (ii) the Third Party Claim
relates to or otherwise arises in connection with any criminal or regulatory
enforcement action, investigation, suit or proceeding. If the Indemnitor
assumes the Third Party Defense in accordance herewith (or if the panel
counsel controls any Third Party Claim that is the subject of _Section_ __ _
6.5(d)_ (a "Section 6.5(d) Claim")), (i) the Indemnitee (or the Sellers in
the context of a Section 6.5(d) Claim) may retain separate co-counsel at its
sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim
but the Indemnitor (or the panel counsel in the context of a Section 6.5(d)
Claim) shall control the investigation, defense

 



-34-  and settlement thereof, (ii) the Indemnitee (or the Sellers in the context
of a Section 6.5(d) Claim) will not file any papers or consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (or the panel
counsel in the context of a Section 6.5(d) Claim) (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (iii) the Indemnitor (or the Buyer in
the context of a Section 6.5(d) Claim) will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim to
the extent such judgment or settlement provides for injunctive or equitable
relief or does not expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee (or
the Sellers in the context of a Section 6.5(d) Claim) from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim with prejudice without the
prior written consent of the Indemnitee (or the Sellers in the context of a
Section 6.5(d) Claim) (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). The Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize
Losses from Third Party Claims and will act in good faith in responding to,
defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with such claims. The Parties
will also cooperate in any such defense and give each other reasonable access
to all information relevant thereto. Whether or not the Indemnitor has
assumed the Third Party Defense, such Indemnitor will not be obligated to
indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder for any settlement entered into or any
judgment that was consented to without the Indemnitors prior written consent
(which consent was not unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 

(c) If the Indemnitor does not assume the Third Party Defense within twenty
Business Days after the Indemnitees compliance with _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_
or the Indemnitor is not entitled to assume the Third Party Defense pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_, the Indemnitee will be entitled to assume the
Third Party Defense upon delivery of notice to such effect to the Indemnitor;
_provided_ that the (i) Indemnitor shall have the right to participate in the
Third Party Defense at its sole cost and expense, but the Indemnitee shall
control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof; and (ii) the
Indemnitor will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder for any
settlement entered into or any judgment that was consented to without the
Indemnitors prior written consent (which consent was not unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

(d) The Parties agree that the defense of any Third Party Claim against
Buyer or any of its Affiliates or a Transferred Seller Representative alleging
any act, event, circumstance, activity or conduct existing or occurring or
arising prior to the applicable Conversion by a Transferred
Seller Representative for which professional liability insurance coverage is
available under any errors and omissions insurance policy of the Buyer or any
of its Affiliates shall be controlled by panel counsel designated by the
insurance carrier;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if (i) such Third Party
Claim is also brought against any Seller or (ii) the damages alleged or
demanded in such Third Party Claim exceed, or at any time during the defense
of such Third Party Claim become estimable and probable to exceed, the policy
limits under the applicable insurance policies, the Sellers rights under
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_, including the right to assume defense of such Third
Party Claim, and the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.5(c)_ shall apply.

_SECTION_ __ _ 6.6._  _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party
Claims_. The Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnitor in writing promptly of its
discovery of any matter for which it is seeking or plans to seek
indemnification hereunder and that does not involve a Third Party Claim, such
notice shall (a)

 



-35-  state that the Indemnitee has paid Losses or anticipates that it will incur
liability for Losses for which such Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement, and (b) specify in reasonable detail each
individual item of Loss included in the amount so stated, the date such item
was paid, the basis for any anticipated liability and the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, breach of covenant or claim to which
each such item is related and the computation of the amount to which such
Indemnitee claims to be entitled hereunder _provided_ , _however_ , that a
failure by an Indemnitee to include information that is incomplete or unknown
shall not affect the rights of the Indemnitee or the obligations of the
Indemnitee other than if the Indemnitor shall have been actually prejudiced as
a result of such failure. The Indemnitee will reasonably cooperate and assist
the Indemnitor in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the
Indemnitee and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and
cooperation will include providing reasonable access to and copies of
information, records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing
employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of such
matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such
matters.

 

 _SECTION_ __ _ 6.7._ _Calculation of Indemnity Payments_.

 

(a) Each Indemnitee shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue
and collect on any recovery available under any insurance policies. The
amount of Losses payable under this _ARTICLE VI_ by the Indemnitor shall be
reduced by any and all amounts recovered by the Indemnitee under applicable
insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible
therefor. If the Indemnitee receives any amounts under applicable insurance
policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses,
subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnitor, then such
Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitor for any payment made or
expense incurred by such Indemnitor in connection with providing such
indemnification up to the amount received by the Indemnitee, net of any
reasonable expenses incurred by such Indemnitee in collecting such amount.

(b) To the extent required by applicable Law, each Indemnitee shall
take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Losses as soon as
reasonably practicable after such Indemnitee becomes aware of any event which
does, or could reasonably be expected to, give rise to any such Losses.

 

(c) In no event shall any Party be liable for (and the term Losses shall
exclude) any (i) consequential, lost profits, special, indirect, exemplary or
diminution in value Losses unless, and solely to the extent that, such Losses
(A) are, as of the Closing Date, the reasonably foreseeable or contemplated
consequence of the breach giving rise to such damages and (B) can be shown
with reasonable certainty, or (ii) punitive damages unless, and solely to the
extent that, a Party becomes obligated to pay any punitive damages to a third
party that is not an Affiliate of any Party.

 

(d) For purposes of determining the amount of Losses (but not for purposes
of determining whether a breach of a representation or warranty has occurred)
under this _Article VI_ , all "materiality" and "material adverse effect"
qualifiers contained in any representation or warranty shall be disregarded.

 



-36- (e) Any and all amounts payable by any Indemnitor to an Indemnitee will
be payable promptly directly by such Indemnitor (or its designee) by wire
transfer of same-day funds in accordance with payment instructions provided by
such Indemnitee.

 

 _SECTION_ __ _ 6.8._ _Investigations_. The right of any Indemnitee
to indemnification pursuant to this _Article VI_ will not be affected by any
investigation conducted or knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired)
at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the end of the Conversion Period, with respect to the accuracy
of any representation or warranty, or performance of or compliance with any
covenant or agreement, referred to in _Sections_ __ _ 6.2_ or _6.4_.

 

 _SECTION_ __ _ 6.9._ _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. Except
as otherwise required by applicable Law, the Parties shall treat any payment
made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.9_ and this _Article VI_ as an adjustment
to the purchase price for all Tax purposes.

provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to

hereto without the prior written consent of the other Parties, provided,
however, that upon ten Business Days prior notice (a) the Buyer may assign

Agreement may be waived at any time in writing by the Party against whom such
