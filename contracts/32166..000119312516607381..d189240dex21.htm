EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

 

3.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as
a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company, the following shall occur: __

 

(a) _Excluded Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned
of record immediately prior to the Effective Time by Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiaries (the "Excluded Stock") shall not represent the right to receive
the Merger Consideration and (x) if held of record directly by the Company or
Parent, shall be automatically cancelled and will cease to exist without any
conversion thereof, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange for
such cancellation, and (y) if held of record by any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent (including Merger Sub),
will be, at the election of Parent, either (i) converted into that number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation that bears the same ratio
to the aggregate number of outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation as the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by such
subsidiary bore to the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (ii) cancelled and
(in the case of this clause (ii)) will cease to exist without any conversion
thereof, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for
such cancellation.

 



-12- (b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Company Common Stock cancelled or converted into shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_ and
Dissenting Shares) (each such share, a "Common Share") will be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive in cash
$13.12 per Common Share, payable to the holder thereof, without interest and
less any applicable withholding taxes (the "Merger Consideration"). Upon
conversion at the Effective Time, all such Common Shares will no longer be
outstanding, will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist, and,
subject to _Section 3.3_ , each holder of a certificate which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any Common Shares (each, a
"Certificate") and each holder of book-entry shares which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented Common Shares (the "Book-Entry Shares") will
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration allocable thereto in accordance with, and
subject to the conditions of, this _Article III_.

 

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common
stock, no par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly and validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, no par value, of
the Surviving Corporation. 

3.2 _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent, at its sole expense, shall appoint
Computershare Trust Company N.A. or such other exchange agent as reasonably
acceptable to the Company and Parent (the "Exchange Agent") to act as the
agent for the purpose of exchanging the Merger Consideration for: (i) the
Certificates, or (ii) Book-Entry Shares. At the Closing, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Common Shares, sufficient funds to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of all of the Common Shares
represented by the Certificates and the Book-Entry Shares (the "Payment Fund")
in amounts and at the times necessary for such payments. If for any reason
(including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the Merger
Consideration that is payable in respect of all of the Common Shares
represented by the Certificates and the Book-Entry Shares, Parent shall take
all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly
(and in any case, within five (5) Business Days) to deposit, or cause to be
deposited, in trust additional cash with the Exchange Agent sufficient to make
all remaining payments required to be made under this Section 3.2 and Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for the payment
thereof. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by,
investments of the Payment Fund by the Exchange Agent shall be payable to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, and any amounts in excess of the amounts
payable pursuant to _Section 3.1_ shall be promptly returned to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, in each case as directed by Parent. The Surviving
Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses of the Exchange Agent incurred
in connection with the exchange of Common Shares for the Merger Consideration.
The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to pay the
Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of all of the Common Shares
represented by the Certificates and the Book-Entry Shares. Promptly after the
Effective Time (and in any case, within five (5) Business Days), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each record holder of
Common Shares at the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal in a customary
form to be

 



-13-  mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent (the "Letter of Transmittal")
and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent) for
use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates or transfer of the Book-
Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration.

(b) Each holder of Common Shares that have been converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration shall, subject to Section 3.2(f), be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Common Shares
represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share upon (i) surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly
executed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be
requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by
the Exchange Agent or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request in the case of Book-Entry Shares. After
the Effective Time and until so surrendered or transferred, each such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof. No interest shall be paid or
accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of any Certificate
or Book-Entry Share.

 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such
payment that (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be
properly transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or
transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares. The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately
upon the Effective Time and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this _Article III_.

 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand.

(f) Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed to the
holders of Company Common Stock for six (6) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holders
of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this _Article
III_ shall (subject to the remainder of this Section 3.2(f)) thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon but subject to any applicable withholdings. If
any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been exchanged prior to
two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date
on which the related Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental

 



-14-  Authority) any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any cash
from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law.

(g) No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates.

 

3.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding on the date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote
on the Merger (other than shares cancelled or converted into shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_ ),
which were not voted in favor of the Merger, and the holders of which (i) have
properly demanded that the Company purchase such shares of Company Common
Stock at their fair market value in accordance with Section 1301 of CGCL,
(ii) have properly submitted such shares for endorsement in accordance with
Section 1302 of CGCL and (iii) have not otherwise failed to perfect or shall
not have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to be entitled to require
the Company to purchase their shares under CGCL (such shares of Company Common
Stock being referred to collectively as the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 3.1(b) allocable to such Dissenting Shares, but instead shall be
entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 1300 _et. seq._ of the
CGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or loses such holders right to appraisal pursuant to Section 1300
_et. seq._ of the CGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine
that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 1300  _et.
seq._ of the CGCL, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if
they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_ , without
interest thereon but subject to any applicable withholdings, upon surrender
of such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such Book-
Entry Share, as the case may be. The Company shall provide Parent prompt
written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand,
notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the CGCL that relates to such demand. Parent shall have the
opportunity and right to direct all negotiations, petitions and proceedings
with respect to any such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

 

3.4 _Adjustments_. If, at any time during the period between the
Agreement Date and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company shall occur (other than the issuance of
additional shares of capital stock of the Company as expressly permitted by
this Agreement) by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split (including reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment
of shares, or any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock, the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change and to provide to the holders
of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this

-15- 3.5 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this _Article III_ such amounts
as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of any applicable Tax law. All amounts
deducted and withheld shall be treated as having been paid to the Person in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

3.6 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a

Certificate, the allocable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated under this

and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
holder of that Company Stock Award or any other Person, cancelled and
converted into the right to receive from Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (through the applicable payroll system), as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of such Company Stock Award multiplied by (y)
the Merger Consideration, less any Taxes required to be withheld in accordance
with _Section 3.5_. In addition, each restricted stock unit that was unvested

4.5(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, less applicable Taxes required to
be withheld under _Section 3.5_.

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board
and the Companys Compensation Committee shall adopt such resolutions and take
such other actions as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of
_Section 3.7(a)_. The Company shall take all actions necessary to (i)
terminate the Company Stock Plan and (ii) amend the Company SERP to remove the
requirement for employer matching contributions (such amendment to be in form
reasonably acceptable to Parent), in each case of clause (i) and (ii),
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time (it being understood and
agreed that no further awards or other rights with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock shall be granted under the Company Stock Plan and no
further employer contributions shall be required under the Company SERP
following the Effective Time).

disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed and maintained to ensure that
information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
required to be disclosed in the Companys reports under the Exchange Act, is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer by others in the Company or its Subsidiaries
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure under the Exchange
Act and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company has disclosed to the Companys auditors
and the audit committee of the Company Board (and made summaries of such
disclosure(s) available to Parent) (i) any "signifcant deficiency" or

financial reporting that could adversely affect in any material respect the
Companys ability to timely record, process, summarize and report financial

Sarbanes-Oxley Act) any "extensions of credit" (within the meaning of Section
402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) to directors or executive officers (as defined
in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The Company is otherwise in compliance with all applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market, except for any non-compliance
that would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(f) _Off-balance Sheet Arrangements_. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is a party to, is subject to, or has any commitment to become a
party to or subject to, any off balance sheet partnership or any similar

relationship between or among the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any
"off balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K
under the Exchange Act)) where the result, purpose or effect of such Contract
or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving,
or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the
Company SEC Reports or in the Companys or such Subsidiarys published
financial statements.

 

4.7 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Company nor any of its

to become due and whether or not required to be recorded or reflected on a
balance sheet under GAAP, except (a) to the extent accrued or reserved
against in the unaudited consolidated balance sheet (including the notes

course of business consistent with past practice, (c) for liabilities and

income Tax Returns and other material Tax Returns required to be filed by
them. Such Tax Returns are true, complete and correct in all material
respects. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently the
beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return other
than extensions of time to file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice. All material Taxes due and owing by

Return) have been timely paid or, where payment is not yet due, the Company
has made an adequate provision for such Taxes in the Companys financial
statements (in

 



-23-  accordance with GAAP). The Companys most recent financial statements
reflect an adequate reserve (in accordance with GAAP) for all material Taxes
payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries through the date of such
financial statements. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred any material Liability for Taxes since the date of the Companys most
recent financial statements outside the ordinary course of business.

withheld and timely paid each material Tax required to have been withheld and
paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any Employee, independent
contractor, creditor, customer, shareholder or other party, and

provisions of Applicable Law. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
properly classified all individuals providing services to such entity as
employees or non-employees for all relevant purposes.

property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for Taxes, other
than liens that arise by operation of law for Taxes not yet due and payable.

 

(d) _Deficiencies and Audits_. No deficiency for any material amount
of Taxes which has been proposed, asserted or assessed in writing by any
taxing authority against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries remains
unpaid. There are no waivers or extensions of any statute of limitations
currently in effect with respect to Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. There are no audits, suits, proceedings, investigations, claims,
examinations or other administrative or judicial proceedings ongoing, or, to
the Companys Knowledge, pending or threatened with respect to any material
Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(e) _Jurisdictions_. No claim has ever been made by
any Governmental Authority with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in a jurisdiction where the Company or such Subsidiary does not
file a Tax Return that the Company or such Subsidiary is or may be subject to
Taxes by that jurisdiction that would be covered by or the subject of such
Tax Return.

(f) _Statute of Limitations_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or
agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency.

or both, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. No

Committee resolution to recommend that the Company Board approve this
Agreement, to the effect that, as of date of such opinion and based upon and
subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters
considered in connection with the preparation of such opinion, the Merger
Consideration to be received by holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger
is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, and, as of the date
of this Agreement, such opinion has not been withdrawn, revoked or modified. A

been prepared in good faith based on reasonable assumptions and the best
available information to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

4.22 _Accounts Receivable_. Since May 31, 2012, neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary of the Company has changed its business practices in such a
manner as would reasonably be expected to result in an accounts receivable
portfolio that, in amount or character, is materially different than that

any material respect their relationship with, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Companys Knowledge, is any such action being
considered.

person under United States sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign
Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury ("OFAC"). Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has engaged in any business with any

-37- 5.7 _Financing_ _Capability_. As of the date hereof, Parent has
delivered to the Company duly executed copies of the equity commitment letter,
dated as of May _27_ , 2016 between Parent and Guarantor (the "Equity
Financing Commitment"), pursuant to which such Person has committed to
invest, subject solely to the terms and conditions set forth therein, the
amount set forth therein (the "Equity Financing"). Assuming that (x) the
conditions set forth in Section 8.1 have been satisfied, (y)
the representations and warranties made by the Company are true and correct
(without giving effect to any Material Adverse Effect or materiality qualifier
or exception contained therein), and (z) the Company has performed and
complied with all covenants and agreements required to be performed by it
hereunder, the aggregate proceeds contemplated to be disbursed pursuant to the
Equity Financing Commitment together with cash and cash equivalents available
to Parent, will, in the aggregate, be sufficient for Parent to consummate the
Merger, to pay the total Merger Consideration, to repay or refinance in full
existing Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with
the Payoff Letters, and to pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby. As of the Agreement Date, the

Equity Financing Commitment. As of the Agreement Date, no event has occurred
which would result in any breach or violation of or constitute a default (or
an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) by
Parent under the Equity Financing Commitment, and, assuming the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in _Sections_ ___8.1_ and _8.2_ , as of the
Agreement Date, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Equity Financing will not be satisfied or that the Equity
Financing will not be available to Parent on the Closing Date.

Subsidiaries be operated after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
and each of its Subsidiaries, considered as a whole, (a) will be able to pay
its debts, including its stated and contingent liabilities as they mature, (b)
will not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which it is and
will be engaged, and (c) will be Solvent. For the purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _Solvent_ ", when used with respect to any person, means that, as
of any date of determination, the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the
assets of such person will, as of such date, exceed the sum of (a) the value
of all "liabilities of such person, including contingent and other
liabilities", as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally
determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the
insolvency of debtors, and (b) the amount that will be required to pay the
probable liabilities of such person, as of such date, on its existing debts
(including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute
and mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have unreasonably capital
for the

 



-38-  business in which it is and will be engaged" and "able to pay its debts,
including its stated and contingent liabilities as they mature" means that
such person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset
dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations
as they become due.

 

5.9 _Broker_ __ _s Fees_. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any
Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub is obligated for the payment of any fees,
commission or expenses of any investment banker, broker, finder, financial
advisor or similar Person for which the Company could be responsible in
connection with the origin, negotiation or execution of this Agreement or in
connection with the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, other than those that become payable by the Surviving Corporation
following consummation of the Merger.

with the Transactions) to:

 

(i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation,

determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel and financial advisor, that (A) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or would reasonably be expected to become a Superior Proposal, and (B) with
respect to such written Acquisition Proposal, that the failure to take the

(d) The Company shall advise Parent promptly (and in any event within 48
hours) of the receipt by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives of any inquiries, proposals or offers,

form of consideration and all material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to or relating
to, constituting or which is intended to or is reasonably expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal, and any material developments, discussions or
negotiations in connection therewith, or any material modifications to the
financial or other terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to or relating to, constituting or
which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company represents and warrants that the Company and its

Confidentiality Agreement), or require the Company to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Merger, (D) within five Business Days following a

_Section_ _ _ _6.4(f)_ , fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal
subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 within ten Business
Days after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that a
customary "stop, look and listen" communication during such ten-Business Day
period will not constitute a failure to 

 



-45-  recommend against an Acquisition Proposal _provided_ that the Company Board
expressly publicly reaffirms the Board Recommendation in such disclosure, (F)
authorize, adopt, approve, endorse, declare advisable or recommend, or
publicly propose to authorize, adopt, approve, endorse, declare advisable or

as applicable, prior to the time the Shareholder Vote is obtained, the Company
Board may, (x) in response to the occurrence of an Intervening Event, make an
Adverse Recommendation in accordance with this _Section_ _ _ _6.4(f)_ , or

enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ _ _
_9.3(a)_ in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, but only if (in the
case of clauses (x) and (y)), prior to taking any such action:

 

(i) the Company Board shall have reasonably determined in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that (A) such Intervening Event has occurred or such written
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (B) that the failure
to make such Adverse Recommendation or, in the case of a written Acquisition
Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, the failure to terminate this
Agreement to concurrently enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement pursuant
to  _Section_ _ _ _9.3(a)_ in connection with such Superior Proposal, would
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under
Applicable Law;

 

(ii) the Company shall have first provided written notice to Parent, at
least three (3) Business Days in advance of taking such action, notifying
Parent that it is prepared to make (A) an Adverse Recommendation in accordance

to concurrently enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal, which notice shall include (x) in the case of a Superior
Proposal, the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of the transaction that constitutes the
Superior Proposal and a copy of all of the material transaction documents in
respect of such Acquisition Proposal and (y) in the case of an Intervening
Event, a written description of such Intervening Event and the Company
Boards determination of the anticipated materially favorable impact on the
fair market value of the Company Common Stock;

 

(iii) the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during
the three (3) Business Days after the Parents receipt of such notice (it
being understood that any material revision, amendment, update or supplement
to the terms and conditions of an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a
Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and an additional three (3)
Business Day period) (any such notice period, the "Notice Period"), negotiate
with Parent and its Representatives, to the extent Parent and its
Representatives wish to negotiate, in good faith to make such adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that (x) such Acquisition
Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal or (y) in connection with
an Intervening Event, the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation would
no longer be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under
Applicable Law; and

 



-46- (iv) Parent has not, within the Notice Period, made a proposal that
the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys legal counsel and financial advisor, causes (x) the Acquisition
Proposal that was previously determined to constitute a Superior Proposal to
no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or (y) in connection with an
Intervening Event the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation to no longer
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under
Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _6.4(f)_ , and any such
purported termination shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, be void
and of no force or effect, unless (A) at or concurrently with such termination
the Company pays the Termination Fee in full and otherwise complies with the
provisions of _Section_ _ _ _9.7)_ , and (B) the Company, its Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives have not breached this _Section_ _ _
_6.4_ in any material respect (or this _Section 6.4(f)_ in any respect).

which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach of this _Section
6.4_ , and the Company does not take reasonable action to seek to cure such
breach within three (3) Business Days of the date on which the Company obtains

this _Section 6.4_.

terms and conditions as are designated in writing by Parent (any such
intercompany loan, a "Requested Intercompany Loan"); provided that in the good
faith judgment of the Company: (i) there is sufficient available cash to make
such Requested Intercompany Loan (after consideration of necessary working
capital requirements), (ii) such Requested Intercompany Loan will not violate
any Law or require pre-approval by any Governmental Authority that has not
been obtained in order for such loan to be made in compliance with applicable
Law, and (iii) there is no material risk that such Requested Intercompany Loan
would result in the imposition of Taxes on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (assuming repayment of the Requested Intercompany Loan in
accordance

 



-51-  with its terms). Any such Requested Intercompany Loan shall be made in U.S.
dollars or the currency of the lending entity; _provided_ _,_ _further_
_,_ _ _ that, if the loan is not made in U.S. dollars, the Company shall use
reasonable efforts to cause the proceeds of such loan to be exchanged for an
equivalent amount in U.S. dollars prior to the Effective Time. If the Company
determines that any Requested Intercompany Loan cannot reasonably be made
prior to the Closing in compliance with the conditions set forth in this
paragraph, the Company shall notify Parent in writing of its inability to
make such Requested Intercompany Loan as soon as practical. If the Closing
does not occur for any reason, Parent shall indemnify the Company for any
cost, expense or damage incurred by it (including any Tax) as a result of the

7.2 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Regulatory Approvals_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this

be. Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to comply
promptly with any inquiries or requests for additional information from the
FTC, the DOJ, and any other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction and
(ii) to take such actions as are necessary or advisable to obtain prompt

proceeding is instituted by a Governmental Authority or private party
challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, the Parent and Merger
Sub shall cooperate in all respects with the Company and shall contest and
resist any such action or proceeding and seek to have vacated, lifted,

in connection with any proceeding by a private party, and any
other information supplied by such party and such partys Affiliates to a
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to Applicable Law, Parent and Merger
Sub shall permit outside counsel for the Company reasonable opportunity to
review in advance, and shall consider in good faith the views of the Company
in connection with, any proposed written or, if practicable, oral
communication to any Governmental Authority relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees not to
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by
telephone, with any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the
Company in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Authority, gives the Company the opportunity to attend and participate.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub will be required to share with the Company any information that
(I) does not relate to the Company and its Subsidiaries, or (II) reveals
Parents (or its affiliates) valuation or negotiating strategy with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby.

neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, without Parents prior

any waiting period under any Applicable Law or any agreement not to consummate
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be permitted
to (and in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates be required to) offer or agree to sell or otherwise dispose of, or
hold separate, agree to conduct, license or otherwise limit the use of any of
the assets, categories of asset or businesses or other segments of the
Company or Parent or eithers respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or to
agree to any other restriction or condition that would reasonably be expected
to materially and adversely affect the operation of the business of the
Company, Parent or eithers respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, and (iii)
Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to, make or agree to any payments
or other consideration to any third party, or agree to modify the terms of
any Contract, waive any right or grant any concession, in each case, to obtain
any consent, waiver or release.

 

(f) Parent represents and warrants that Parent and its HSR Affiliates and
HSR Associates do not own any interest in assets or a business that would
reasonably be expected to cause execution of this Agreement or consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby to result in any legislative,
administrative or judicial action (including any suit instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable
Governmental Authority or any private party) challenging any of the
transactions contemplated hereby as violative of the HSR Act or any Antitrust
Laws or that would otherwise reasonably be expected to materially impair or
delay the satisfaction of the condition set forth in in _Section 8.1(a)_.
Without limiting any other obligation under this Agreement, during the period
from the date of this Agreement until the satisfaction of the condition in
_Section 8.1(a)_ , Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and HSR
Affiliates and HSR Associates to not, enter into any commitment, undertaking,
obligation, or agreement to acquire any material amounts of assets of or
equity in any other Person or any business or division thereof if such
acquisition or agreement would be reasonably expected to create a material
risk of making it more difficult to obtain Consent of the FTC or the DOJ or
any other Governmental Authority required to satisfy the condition set forth
in _Section 8.1(a)_.

 

7.3 _Financing_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, but subject to _Article IX_ , Parent expressly acknowledges and
agrees that Parents obligations under this Agreement are not conditioned in
any manner whatsoever upon the Purchaser obtaining any financing.

 

7.4 _Proxy Statement_. The information included or incorporated by
reference in the Proxy Statement supplied by Parent or Merger Sub in writing
expressly for inclusion or incorporation therein will not, at the time it is
first mailed to the Company Shareholders, at the time of any amendments or
supplements thereto and at the time of the Shareholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty
with respect to any statements included or incorporated by reference in the
Proxy Statement based on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

 



-54- 7.5 _Indemnification of Company Directors and Officers_.

(a) If the Merger is consummated, then until the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill
and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company to its current and
former directors and officers (the "Company Indemnified Parties") pursuant
to any indemnification provisions under the Companys Charter, Company Bylaws
and any indemnification agreement which has been provided to Parent between
the Company and such Company Indemnified Parties, as in effect on the
Agreement Date, with respect to claims arising out of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time. Any claims for indemnification made
under this _Section_ _ _ _7.5(a)_ on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time shall survive such anniversary until the final resolution
thereof.

(b) This  _Section_ _ _ _7.5_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger, is intended to benefit each Company Indemnified Party, shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and Parent,
and, notwithstanding  _Section 10.14_ shall be enforceable by the Company
Indemnified Parties.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall purchase directors and
officers liability insurance coverage for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time for the Companys current directors and officers for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, the material terms of which,
including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect
to such directors and officers than the Companys existing policies as of the
Agreement Date and provided further, that in no event shall Parent be
required to pay annual premiums for insurance under this _Section_ _ _
_7.5(c)_ in excess of 200% of the amount of the annual premiums paid by the
Company for fiscal year 2016 for such purpose (which fiscal year 2016
premiums are hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be as set
forth in _Section_ _ _ _7.5(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule) (200% of
such current annual premium, the "Premium Cap"), it being understood that
Parent shall provide or cause to be provided a policy for the applicable
individuals with the best coverage as is then available at a cost up to but
not exceeding the Premium Cap. In lieu of maintaining the existing directors
and officers liability insurance contemplated by this Section 7.5(c), the
Company may (or if requested by Parent, the Company shall) purchase a six-year
prepaid "tail" policy with respect to matters arising on or prior to the
Effective Time, covering without limitation the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (i) for an aggregate cost not in excess of
the Premium Cap, (ii) having aggregate coverage limits over the term of
such "tail" policy with respect to directors and officers liability
coverage in an amount not to exceed the annual aggregate coverage limit under
the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance policies
and (iii) on terms and conditions no less favorable in any material respect to
such directors and officers than the Companys existing policies as of the
Agreement Date or, if the aggregate cost of such a policy would exceed
the Premium Cap, on terms and conditions providing the best coverage as is
then available at a cost up to, but not exceeding, the Premium Cap.

 

7.6 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
date which is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time (or if earlier, the
date of the employees termination of employment with Parent and its
Subsidiaries), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to provide the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who remain employed immediately after the Effective Time
(collectively, the "Company Continuing Employees") with base salary and target
cash bonus opportunities (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, equity-based
compensation or specific

 



-55-  performance targets) that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to the
base salary and target cash bonus opportunities provided by the Company and
its Subsidiaries on the Agreement Date. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall confer upon any employee any right with respect to continued employment
by Parent or Surviving Corporation, nor shall anything herein interfere with
the right of Parent or Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of
any employee (including any Company Continuing Employee) at any time, with or
without cause, following the effective date of his or her employment with
Parent or Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement that is sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (collectively, "Parent Benefit Plans") in which any
Company Continuing Employees are or may become eligible to participate in on
or following the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the extent
permitted by the terms of the Parent Benefit Plans, recognize all service of
the Company Continuing Employees with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, as if such service were with Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit
levels based on seniority; _provided, that_ , such service shall not
be recognized (i) for benefit accrual purposes under any Parent Benefit Plan
that is a defined benefit pension plan, or (ii) to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Company Continuing Employee or other employee of
the Company, or any beneficiary or dependents thereof, with respect to any
right of employment (including, without limitation, the compensation, terms
and conditions of employment and benefits) or any other legal or equitable
right, benefit or remedy of any nature. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed
or implied, shall amend, or be deemed to amend, any Parent Benefit Plan or any
Benefit Plan, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to, or does, constitute the establishment of, or an amendment to, any Parent
Benefit Plan or any Benefit Plan.

 

7.7 _Public Announcements_. Parent shall consult with Company before
issuing, and give the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon, any employee communication, press release or other public statements
with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such communication, press release
or make any public announcement without the prior consent of the Company,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, except as may be required by
Applicable Law. This Section shall not restrict Parents disclosure of
information regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, including any
information related to Parents determination to enter into this Agreement, to
investors or prospective investors in Parent so long as such disclosures
are made pursuant to a confidentiality agreement containing customary terms.
The parties hereto agree that the initial press release to be issued with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby following execution of this
Agreement shall be a joint release in the form heretofore agreed to by Parent
and the Company.

_Section 9.7_ , _Section 9.8_ , _Section 9.9_ and _Article X_ shall survive
the termination hereof and remain in effect, and (b) no such termination shall
relieve any party from any liability or damages resulting from a material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement or fraud, in which case the non-breaching party shall
be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, in no event (other than in the case of fraud)
shall any party hereto be liable for punitive damages, except to the extent
the non-breaching party owes such damages to a Third Party.

 

9.7 _Termination Fee and Expenses_. In the event that:

 

(a) (1) an Acquisition Proposal has been made, proposed or communicated
after the date hereof and prior to the completion of the Shareholders Meeting
(or prior to the termination of this Agreement if there has been no
Shareholders Meeting), (2) following the occurrence of an event described in
the preceding clause (1), this Agreement is terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or 9.2(b) or by Parent pursuant to Section
9.4(b) and (3) within twelve months of the date this Agreement is terminated,
the Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal or enters into a Contract in
respect of an Acquisition Proposal which is thereafter consummated (whether or
not such Acquisition Proposal was the same Acquisition Proposal referred to in
clause (1)); _provided_ , that for purposes of clause (3) of this Section
9.7(a), the references to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "50%";

 

(b) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
9.3(a)_ ; or

 

(c) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_ ;

 

then the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designees) a fee in an amount
equal to the Termination Fee in cash, (x) in the case of Section 9.7(a),
within two Business Days after the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal,
(y) in the case of Section 9.7(b), prior to or concurrently with such
termination or (z) in the case of Section 9.7(c), within five Business
Days after such termination. In no event shall the Company be required to pay
the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

9.8 _Acknowledgement_. Each Party acknowledges that (a) the
agreements contained in this _Article IX_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) without the agreements
contained in this _Article IX_ , neither Parent nor the Company would have
entered into this Agreement and that the Termination Fee is not a penalty,
but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent and Merger Sub in the circumstances in which such Termination Fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to
_Section 9.7_ or and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent and/or Merger
Sub commences an Action that results in a judgment against the Company
for the amount set forth in _Section 9.7_ or any portion thereof, Parent
and/or Merger Sub shall recover from the Company its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by it and its
Affiliates in connection with such suit, together with interest on such
amount or portion thereof until the date of payment at the prime

 



-61-  lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made. Any interest payable hereunder shall be
calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be
paid until (but excluding) the date of actual payment, and on the basis of a
360-day year.

 

9.9 _Limitation on Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement:

(a) No Parent Party, except Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantor (but
only to the extent set forth in the Limited Guaranty), shall have any
liability for any obligation or liability to the Company, any of its
Affiliates or any of its or their direct or indirect shareholders for any
claim for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of this Agreement, the
Limited Guaranty or the Equity Financing Commitment (including any willful and
material breach), or the failure of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby to be consummated, or in respect of any oral
representation made or alleged to be have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise;

 

(b) Without limiting the right of the Company to seek specific
performance in accordance with Section 10.7, the maximum aggregate liability
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantor for any loss suffered as a result of
any breach of this Agreement, the Limited Guaranty or the Equity Financing
Commitment (including any willful and material breach), or the failure of the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or thereby to be
consummated, or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to be
have been made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at
law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, shall be limited to the amount of the
Damages Cap, and in no event shall the Company seek to, and the Company shall
cause its Affiliates and its and their direct and indirect shareholders not to
seek to, recover any money damages (including consequential, indirect or
punitive damages) in excess of such amount; and

 

(c) Without in any way limiting the generality of _Section 9.9(a)_ , upon
payment of damages in an amount equal to the Damages Cap, no Parent Party
shall have any further liability or obligation to the Company, any of its
Affiliates or any of its or their direct or indirect stockholders relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, the Limited Guaranty or the Equity
Financing Commitment, or the failure of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby to be consummated, whether in equity or at law,
in contract, in tort or otherwise, and in such event, the Company shall not
seek to, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their direct and indirect
stockholders not to seek to, recover any money damages (including
consequential, indirect or punitive damages, or damages on account of a
willful and material breach) from any Parent Party.

-62- 10.2 _Governing_ _ _ _Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by

(a) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably submits itself to the personal
jurisdiction of any court of proper subject matter jurisdiction in the State
of California, City of Los Angeles (and any appellate court therefrom) in the
event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the Merger, and agrees that
it will not bring any Action relating to this Agreement or the Merger in any
court other than such a court in the State of California, other than Actions
in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or
award rendered by any such court. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action related to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Merger, that (i) the Action in any
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Action

whether in law or in equity, against the Financing Sources in any way relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any

permitted in any Debt Commitment Letter) the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof).

ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER

the successors and assigns of Parent, including any successor to, or assignee
of, all or substantially all of the business and assets of Parent. Except as
set forth in the preceding sentence, no party hereto may assign or delegate,
in whole or in part, any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Any assignment in violation
of this provision shall be void. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

 

10.5 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or

remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the
intent of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the

 



-63-  parties intend that the remedies and limitations thereon contained in this
Agreement, including Section 9.7 and 9.9, shall be construed as an integral
provision of this Agreement and that such remedies and limitations shall not
be severable in any manner that increases a partys liability or obligations
hereunder or under the Equity Financing Commitment or the Limited Guaranty or
any Debt Commitment Letter. The parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of the void or unenforceable provision.

 

10.6 _Remedies_. The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would
otherwise have hereunder. The exercise by a party to this Agreement of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy. The failure
or delay of any party to enforce any of the provisions hereof shall not be
construed to be a waiver of the right of such party thereafter to enforce such
provisions, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or
power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or
power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.

 

10.7 _Specific Performance_. Subject to the provisions of Section 9.9, the
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that

Company and Parent, may, to the extent authorized by their respective Board
of Directors and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, (a) extend the

(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to it
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for its benefit contained
herein; provided, however, that after the Shareholder Vote has been obtained,
no waiver may be made that pursuant to Applicable Law requires further
approval or adoption by the shareholders of the Company without such further
approval or adoption. No such waiver or extension shall be effective unless
signed in writing by the party against whom such waiver or extension is
asserted.

 

10.9 _Amendments_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement
may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether before or
after receipt of the Shareholder Vote, by written agreement signed by each of
the parties hereto; _provided, however,_ that following the receipt of the
Shareholder Vote, there shall be no amendment or supplement to the provisions
of this Agreement which by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant
self-regulatory organization would require further approval by the holders of
Company Common Stock without such approval. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, _Sections_ _ _ _9.5_ , _9.6_ , _9.9_ , _10.1_ ,
_10.3_ , _10.4_ , _10.13(a)_ and this _Section_ _ _ _10.9_ may not be

party shall bear its respective legal, accountants, and financial advisory
fees and other expenses incurred with respect to this Agreement, the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or

of termination of this Agreement by either party pursuant to Section 9.2(b)
(or a termination by the Company pursuant to a different section of Section
9.2 at a time when this Agreement was terminable pursuant to Section 9.2(b)),

Days after being notified of such by Parent, pay Parent or Parents designee

counterparties, escrow agents, experts and consultants) incurred by Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Equity Financing and
any Debt Financing), by wire transfer of same day funds.

part of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, as

provided, however that any such recovery from Parent is subject, together
with any other damages recoverable from Parent pursuant to this Agreement, to
the Damages Cap. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs
of suit, regardless of whether such suit proceeds to final judgment.
