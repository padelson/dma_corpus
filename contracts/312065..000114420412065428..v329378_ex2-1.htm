obtain the Court Authorization Order at the hearing currently scheduled for
November 27, 2012. In the event that the Court does not issue the Court
Authorization Order by November 27, 2012 or such other date as Purchaser and
Seller may otherwise agree in writing, then the Company shall continue to use
its best efforts to obtain the same, but provided that Purchaser shall
have the right and option, which may be exercised by Purchaser in its sole
and absolute discretion, at any time on or before the Due Diligence
Termination Date, to either (i) remove the Company as a party to this
Agreement and continue this Agreement as an agreement between Purchaser and
Seller without the Company; or (ii) terminate this Agreement by written notice
to Seller, whereupon the Deposit shall be refunded to Purchaser by the Escrow
Agent. Upon any such termination, neither Purchaser nor any of its
Representatives shall have any Liability or obligation whatsoever to any
party hereto or any other Person under or pursuant to this Agreement, any of
the Ancillary Agreements or applicable Law. Seller and the Company agree that
in the event that this Agreement is filed with or disclosed to the Court,
Seller and the Company will use their best efforts to obtain confidential
treatment from the Court with respect to any proprietary information, trade
secrets and other confidential information contained in this Agreement
unless Purchaser otherwise consents in writing.

  



  

1.02 _Purchase Price; Deposit; Allocation_.

  



  

(a) _Purchase Price_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the aggregate purchase price for the Shares and the covenant not
to compete of Seller contained in _Section 4.10_ is One Hundred Fifteen
Million Dollars ($115,000,000) (the " _Purchase Price_ "). Upon Closing, the
Creditor Payments, the Deposit, the Retention Amount and the Holdback Amount
shall be deducted from the Purchase Price and the remaining amount of the
Purchase Price (the " _Remaining Purchase Price_ "), as adjusted based on
prorations and credits under this Agreement, shall be payable to Seller in
immediately available United States funds at the Closing in the manner
provided in _Section 1.04_.

(b) _Deposit_. Within ten (10) Business Days following the
Effective Date, Purchaser shall deliver the Deposit to Escrow Agent. The
Deposit shall be paid by good check (drawn on a bank doing business in Miami-
Dade County, Florida) or by electronic wire transfer of immediately available
funds or an equivalent manner and shall be held in escrow by Escrow Agent
pursuant to the Deposit Escrow Agreement to be executed by Seller, Purchaser
and Escrow Agent and applied toward the Purchase Price at the time of Closing.
Any interest earned on the Deposit shall be applied in the same manner as the
Deposit. The Deposit shall be non-refundable to Purchaser in the event that
the Closing fails to occur due to a default under this Agreement by Purchaser
and the Purchase Agreement is terminated by the Seller Parties pursuant to
_Section 12.01(c)(i)_ , in which event, upon such termination of this
Agreement as a result thereof, the Deposit shall be paid by Escrow Agent to
Seller; otherwise, the Deposit shall be refunded to Purchaser by Escrow Agent
in the event that the Closing fails to occur. Seller acknowledges that the
payment of the Deposit by Purchaser to Escrow Agent to be held and applied
pursuant to the terms hereof is, among other covenants contained in this
Agreement, good, valuable and sufficient consideration for this Agreement.

  



  

(c) _Section 338(h)(10) Election; Company Conversion; Payment of
Taxes; Allocation of Purchase Price_.

  



  

(i) Upon request of Purchaser, Seller agrees to join with Purchaser
in making an election under Code Section 338(h)(10), and any
comparable elections, with respect to the purchase of the Shares, under any
state or local income tax Law (each a " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ "). All
taxes imposed on the deemed sale of assets resulting from the Section
338(h)(10) Election will be included in Seller's tax returns as applicable
and will be paid by Seller. As an alternative to the making of the Section
338(h)(10) Election, upon request of Purchaser, Seller agrees to convert
Company from a Florida corporation to a Florida limited liability company
pursuant to Florida Statutes 607.1112 and 608.439 (a " _Conversion_ "), in
which case, the term "Shares" as used in this Agreement shall mean all of the
membership interests in Company following conversion. A Conversion shall be
treated by Purchaser and Seller as a deemed liquidation of Company by Seller
in a transaction qualifying as a tax free liquidation under Code Section 336
followed by the sale of all of the assets of Company to Purchaser.

(ii) Purchaser and Seller have agreed that in the event Purchaser
requests the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election, or upon the sale
of the Shares to Purchaser following a Conversion, that Purchaser and Seller
shall act together in good faith to determine and agree upon the proper
allocation of the consideration paid by Purchaser for the Shares (and the
assets of Company that are deemed to have been acquired pursuant to Section
338(h)(10)) and the covenant not to compete contained in _Section 4.10_ hereof
(the " _Allocation Schedule_ "). A draft of the Allocation Schedule shall be
prepared by Purchaser and delivered to Seller within 60 days following the
Closing. If Seller notifies Purchaser in writing that Seller objects to one or
more items reflected in the Allocation Schedule, Seller and Purchaser shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Seller and Purchaser are
unable to resolve any dispute with respect to the Allocation Schedule within
90 days following the Closing Date, such dispute shall be resolved by an
impartial nationally recognized firm of independent certified public
accountants (other than Seller\'s accountants or Purchaser's accountants),
and the fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by
Seller and Purchaser. In addition, Purchaser and Seller each agrees that in
the event of the Section 338(h)(10) Election or Conversion (i) that any such
allocation shall be consistent with the requirements of Section 1060 of the
Code and the regulations thereunder, (ii) to complete jointly and to file
Form 8023 (or Form 8594, as applicable), the required schedules related
thereto, and comparable state forms and schedules; (iii) to complete jointly
and to file separately Form 8883 (if required) with its Federal income Tax
Return consistent with such allocation for the tax year in which the Closing
Date occurs; and (iv) that neither party will take a position on any income,
transfer or gains Tax Return, before any Governmental or Regulatory Authority
charged with the collection of any such income, transfer or gains Tax or in
any judicial proceeding relating to any such Tax, that is in any manner
inconsistent with the terms of any such allocation without the prior written
consent of the other party. If any changes are required to be made to these
forms or schedules (including Form 8883) as a result of any adjustments to the
Purchase Price after the Closing, the parties shall promptly and in good
faith reach an agreement as to the precise changes required to be made.
Seller shall assist Purchaser and cooperate with Purchaser in connection with
any and all documents and materials that Purchaser deems necessary to be
prepared and/or filed in connection with making a Section 338(h)(10) Election
or a Conversion.

  



  

(d) _Effect of Payments to Creditors_. Each of the Seller Parties
acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements to the contrary: (i) any
amount of the Purchase Price that is paid by Purchaser to any Creditor or the
Escrow Agent hereunder shall each be deemed to be paid to Seller; (ii) neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (nor Company after the Closing) shall be
liable to Seller for any such payments to any Creditor or the Escrow Agent,
and Seller shall not make any claims or otherwise seek any recourse or
remedies against Purchaser or its Affiliates (nor against Company after the
Closing) for such payments; (iii) neither Seller nor Company shall make any
claims or otherwise seek any recourse or remedies against Purchaser or its
Affiliates for amounts representing the Creditor Payments, the Holdback
Amount, the Deposit or the Retention Amount; and (iv) all such payments and
amounts shall be applied against and be deemed to be payments of the
Purchase Price and shall be deemed to be payments in full satisfaction of
Purchaser's obligations hereunder with respect to such portion of the
Purchase Price. Notwithstanding that Company has joined in this Agreement as a
party in order to induce Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and to
purchase the Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Company acknowledges and agrees that Company shall have no rights
or claims against the Purchase Price or any portion thereof, including the
Creditor Payments, the Holdback Amount, the Deposit or the Retention Amount.

1.03 _Closing_. The Closing will take place at the offices of
Gunster, Yoakley and Stewart, P.A., at 10:00 A.M. Eastern time on the
Closing Date or at such other time and place as may be mutually agreed upon
by the parties. At the Closing, (i) Purchaser will deliver the sum of Seven
Million Five Hundred Thousand and NO/100 Dollars ($7,500,000.00) to the Escrow
Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds (the " _Retention
Amount_ ") to such account or accounts as identified in the Indemnification
Escrow Agreement, to be held, invested and/or disbursed in accordance with
the terms of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, and (ii) Purchaser will
pay the Remaining Purchase Price, as adjusted based on prorations and credits
under this Agreement, to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such accounts as Seller may reasonably direct by written notice
delivered to Purchaser at least two (2) Business Days before the Closing
Date. At the Closing, Seller will transfer, convey and assign to Purchaser
all the Shares (free and clear of any and all Liens) by delivery to Purchaser
of certificates representing the Shares, duly endorsed (or accompanied by
duly executed stock powers in form and substance acceptable to Purchaser in
Purchaser's sole and absolute discretion), for transfer to Purchaser. At the
Closing, Seller, Purchaser and the Escrow Agent shall execute and deliver the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement, and there shall also be delivered to
Purchaser and Seller all contracts, documents, certificates, opinion
and instruments required to be delivered under _Article VI_ and _Article
VII_.

  



  

1.04 _Purchase Price Adjustments and Deductions; Payoff of
Indebtedness; Holdback Amount; Prorations and Credits_.

  



  

(a) The Purchase Price shall be (i) increased by an amount equal to
the amount of Cash on Hand, as such term is defined below (to be verified by
procedures set forth in _Section 1.09_ , below); and (ii) decreased by an
amount equal to the amount of the Accounts Payable and the amount of total
Liabilities of Company associated with Uncashed Tickets and Pre-Closing
Checks, as provided in _Section 1.08_ and _Section 1.09_ of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) No later than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing,
the Seller Parties shall obtain and deliver to Purchaser payoff letters and
Estoppel Certificates from the holders of any Indebtedness of Company
(collectively, the " _Creditors_ "), including without limitation from the
Summit Lenders with respect to the Summit Loan and Security Agreements and MCM
with respect to the MCM Agreement, which payoff letters and Estoppel
Certificates will be delivered by Company to Purchaser and shall
contain payoff amounts, per diem interest, wire transfer instructions and an
agreement by the Creditors to deliver to Company, upon full payment or
release of any such Indebtedness, UCC-3 termination statements, satisfactions
of mortgage and/or other appropriate releases and satisfactions and any and
all original promissory notes or other evidences of Indebtedness marked
canceled. The obligation of the Seller Parties to obtain and deliver Estoppel
Certificates prior to the Closing, shall also be deemed to include
Estoppel Certificates from the City of Miami, Florida, Miami-Dade County,
Florida and the City of Fort Pierce, Florida under those certain three (3)
revenue sharing agreements described in _Schedule II_ (the " _Revenue Sharing
Agreements_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.04 to the
contrary, the Seller Parties shall not be required to obtain payoff letters
for any Indebtedness which constitutes Included Liabilities.

(c) From the Effective Date through the Closing Date, at the sole
cost and expense of the Seller Parties, the Seller Parties shall use best
efforts to procure and deliver to Purchaser prior to or at the Closing,
satisfactions and releases (collectively, the " _Pre-Closing Releases_ ") in
form and substance acceptable to Purchaser in its sole and absolute
discretion, executed by or on behalf of each of the Creditors, beneficiaries
and other contract parties to the agreements, guaranties, obligations and
instruments that are Excluded Contracts and/or Excluded Liabilities
(including those agreements, guaranties, obligations and instruments
described in _Schedule VII_ hereto and/or _Schedule X_ hereto) and claimants
and potential claimants under claims, potential claims and Actions or
Proceedings that are Excluded Litigation and/or Excluded Liabilities
(including those claims, potential claims and Actions or Proceedings
described in Schedule 2.10 hereto, _Schedule VIII_ hereto and/or _Schedule X_
hereto) (including without limitation from the Summit Lenders with respect to
the Summit Loan and Security Agreements and MCM with respect to the MCM
Agreement), fully and unconditionally releasing Company from any and all
Liabilities (including the Summit Liabilities and the MCM Liabilities), and
waiving any claims and/or potential claims that such Creditors, beneficiaries,
other contract parties, claimants and potential claimants may have against
Company, arising under or in connection with such agreements, guaranties,
instruments, any document related thereto or claims, potential claims or
proceedings (collectively, the " _Excluded Creditor Claims and Liabilities_
"). For avoidance of doubt, the Excluded Creditor Claims and Liabilities shall
be deemed to constitute Excluded Liabilities. To the extent that the
procurement of any Pre-Closing Releases that have not been obtained by the
Closing Date requires the payoff of any outstanding Excluded Creditor Claims
and Liabilities, then Purchaser shall have the option, which may be exercised
or not exercised at Purchaser's sole and absolute discretion (and without
waiving any right of Purchaser under _Section 6.01_ ), to proceed to Closing
and (i) pay such Excluded Creditor Claims and Liabilities in whole or in
part at or prior to the Closing using the proceeds of the Purchase Price (the
amount of any and all such payments are collectively referred to herein as
the " _Creditor Payments_ "); and/or (ii) hold back and retain an amount equal
to the unpaid portion of such Excluded Creditor Claims and Liabilities from
the Purchase Price (the " _Holdback Amount_ "). Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Seller Parties shall not be obligated to
obtain or deliver a Pre-Closing Release in respect of any Included Liability.
The amount equal to any and all Creditor Payments and Holdback Amount shall be
deducted from the Purchase Price. Purchaser has been advised of the pendency
of those certain foreclosure actions, described in _Schedule VIII_ (the "
_Summit Actions "_). In connection therewith, Company agrees not to waive any
rights under the Summit Actions or otherwise agree or consent to anything
thereunder or otherwise unreasonably act or fail to act thereunder in manner
that would adversely affect Purchaser's rights under this Agreement or after
the Closing. Furthermore, the Seller Parties agree to use their best efforts
(which shall be deemed to include requesting and attending a hearing under the
aforesaid action) to obtain a payoff letter and an Estoppel Certificate from
Summit, any other Creditor and any other plaintiff under the Summit Actions
computed through the Closing. For the purposes of subparagraph (b) above and
this subparagraph (c), the term "best efforts" with respect to obtaining
payoff letters, Estoppel Certificates and Pre-Closing Releases from the Summit
Lenders with respect to the Summit Loan and Security Agreements and any other
Creditor in any Actions or Proceedings, shall be deemed to include, without
limitation, the obligation to request and attend a hearing under the such
Summit Actions or other Actions or Proceedings to compel the issuance of the
payoff letters, the Estoppel Certificates and Pre-Closing Releases by Summit
Lenders. The Seller Parties further agree that in the event that Purchaser
elects to make a Creditor Payment prior to the Closing to pay off the Summit
Lenders with respect to the Summit Loan and Security Agreements, then the
Seller Parties, as borrower/mortgagor/debtor, and Purchaser, as
lender/mortgagee/secured party, shall reasonably agree upon the appropriate
loan and security documentation in order to evidence a loan in favor of
Purchaser in the amount of such Creditor Payment, which shall provide
Purchaser with a mortgage and a security interest in the Assets in the same
priority as the Summit Loan and Security Agreements. In such event, the
Seller Parties shall pay all mortgage recording tax, recording fees, title
premiums, and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by Purchaser, in connection
with the negotiation, documentation, execution, delivery and recordation of
the applicable loan documents.

(d) The Purchase Price shall also be adjusted (upwards or downwards)
as a result of the following prorations and credits relating to the Assets,
the Excluded Liabilities and the ownership and operation of the Business as of
the Closing Date and reflected in the Operations Settlement Statement as
though the transaction under this Agreement constituted the purchase and sale
of Assets and not the purchase and sale of the Shares, with Seller liable to
Company and the Purchaser for such items to the extent such items relate to
any time period on or prior to the Closing Date or are Excluded Liabilities,
and Company being liable to the extent such items relate to periods
subsequent to the Closing Date or are Included Liabilities:

  



  

(i) Real estate taxes on or with respect to the Assets;

  



  

(ii) Rents, lease amounts, additional rents, taxes and other items
payable by Company under the Operating Agreements;

  



  

(iii) The amount of rents, taxes and charges for sewer, water,
telephone, electricity and other utilities relating to the Real Property and
the real property subject to any Real Property Leases;

  



  

(iv) All other Taxes (except for Income Taxes and Transfer Taxes) on
or with respect to the Assets and/or the Business;

  



  

(v) All prepaid expenses of Company existing on the Closing Date (the
" _Prepaid Expenses_ ");

  



  

(vi) All prepaid deposits of Company in connection with the Business
existing on the Closing Date listed on _Schedule IX_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (the " _Prepaid Deposits_ ");

  



  

(vii) All accrued expenses under the Operating Agreements;

  



  

(viii) The amount of any and all other Indebtedness of Company that
constitutes Excluded Liabilities that have not otherwise been fully paid and
satisfied prior to the Closing shall be applied against the Purchase Price to
reduce the amount of the Purchase Price payable hereunder; and

  



  

(ix) All other items normally pro rated or adjusted in connection
with similar transactions.

EXECUTION COPY

Except as otherwise agreed by the parties, the net amount of all such
prorations and credits will be settled and paid by Seller, on the one hand, or
Purchaser (or at Purchaser's option, Company), on the other hand, as
applicable, on the Closing Date, and: (x) if the real estate tax bill for the
year of this Agreement has not yet been issued then the proration shall be
based on the prior year's taxes, _provided, however, _ that upon receipt of
the 2012 tax bill, each party agrees with the other to re-prorate and pay said
real estate taxes within fifteen (15) days of receipt of said tax bill using
the November four percent (4%) discount amount; (y) all taxes and real
estate assessments will be prorated as of 12:01 A.M. on the Closing Date on
the basis of a 365-day year or a 366-day year, as the case may be. If, on the
Closing Date, the current real property tax bill with respect to the Business
or the Assets is not available, the amount of real property taxes will be
apportioned based on the current year's millage applied to that portion of
the Purchase Price allocated to the Real Property. If the current year's
millage is not fixed, taxes will be apportioned in the same manner based upon
the immediately prior year's millage. Any apportionment of taxes based upon
any figures other than a final tax bill will, at the request of either
Seller, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, be
subsequently reapportioned based upon receipt of the final tax bill for the
current year; and (z) if any of the prorations cannot be
calculated accurately on the Closing Date, then the same will be calculated
within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date and either party
owing the other party a sum of money based on such subsequent prorations will
promptly pay such sum to the other party.

  



  

1.05 _Further Assurances; Post-Closing Cooperation_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at any
time or from time to time after the Closing, at Purchaser's or
Company's request and without further consideration, Seller shall execute and
deliver to Purchaser such other instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance,
assignment and confirmation, provide such materials and information and take
such other actions as Purchaser and Company may reasonably deem necessary or
desirable in order to effectively transfer, convey and assign to Purchaser,
and to confirm Purchaser's title to, all of the Shares, and, to the full
extent permitted by Law, to put Purchaser in actual possession and operating
control of Company, the Business and the Assets and to assist Purchaser in
exercising all rights with respect thereto, and otherwise to cause Seller to
fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Following the Closing, each party will afford the other party,
its counsel and its accountants, during normal business hours,
reasonable access to the books, records and other data relating to the
Business, Company and/or the Excluded Assets in its possession with respect
to periods prior to the Closing and the right to make copies and extracts
therefrom, to the extent that such access may be reasonably required by the
requesting party in connection with (i) the preparation of Tax Returns, (ii)
compliance with the requirements of any Governmental or Regulatory Authority,
(iii) the determination or enforcement of the rights and obligations of such
other party to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
(iv) in connection with any actual or threatened Action or Proceeding.

  



  

(c) If, in order to prepare its Tax Returns, other documents or
reports required to be filed with Governmental or Regulatory Authorities or
its financial statements or to fulfill its obligations hereunder, it is
necessary that a party be furnished with additional information, documents or
records relating to the Business, Company and/or the Excluded Assets not
referred to in _Section 1.05(b) _ above, and such information, documents or
records are in the possession or control of any other party to this Agreement,
such other party shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish or make
available such information, documents or records (or copies thereof) at the
recipient's request, cost and expense. Any information obtained by a party in
accordance with this Section shall be held confidentially by it.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 1.05_ , if Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand, are in an adversarial relationship in litigation or arbitration, the
furnishing of information, documents or records in accordance with
subsections (b) and (c) of this Section shall be subject to applicable rules
relating to discovery.

  



  

(e) In the event that any party hereto collects or receives, after
the Closing, funds belonging to any other party, the party receiving such
funds shall be deemed to have collected or received such funds in trust for
the benefit of the other party, and shall promptly deliver the amounts to the
party entitled thereto, and the parties will cooperate to minimize any such
misdirected funds.

  



  

1.06 _Third Party Consents_. To the extent that the consummation of
the transactions contemplated under this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements (including the sale of the Shares hereunder) will result
in or give rise to any conflict, violation, breach, default, termination,
cancellation, acceleration or modification or require the consent, approval or
notice of the type described in _Section 2.03(c)_ , below, in or with respect
to any Contract to which Company is a party or by which any of its assets and
properties is bound, the Seller Parties shall, at their sole cost and
expense, use their best efforts to obtain the consent or waiver of the other
party or parties to such Contract so that the transactions contemplated hereby
may be consummated without resulting or giving rise to such conflict,
violation, breach, default, termination, cancellation, acceleration or
modification. In the event that such consent or waiver is not obtained prior
to the Closing and the parties consummate the Sale hereunder, then the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified from and against any and
all Losses arising from any such conflict, violation, breach, default,
termination, cancellation, acceleration or modification pursuant to the
indemnification provisions of _Section 11.01(a) _ of this Agreement as though
such Losses were Excluded Liabilities. The provisions of this _Section 1.06_
shall not affect the right of Purchaser to not consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement if the condition to its obligations hereunder
contained in _Section 6.05_ has not been fulfilled.

  



  

1.07 _Insurance Proceeds_.

  



  

(a) _Casualty Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Awards_. If any of
the Assets are destroyed or damaged due to a casualty or other events or
circumstances covered by insurance maintained by Company or taken in
condemnation, the insurance proceeds or condemnation award or claim for
insurance proceeds or condemnation award with respect thereto shall be Assets,
and shall not be Excluded Assets. At the Closing, Seller shall pay or credit
to Purchaser (i) any such insurance proceeds or condemnation awards received
by Seller following the Effective Date but on or prior to the Closing, and
(ii) the amount of any insurance deductibles or self-insured amounts, and the
Company shall have all of the rights against any insurance companies,
Governmental or Regulatory Authorities and others with respect to such
damage, destruction or condemnation. In no event shall Seller or Company
compromise or settle any insurance claim or condemnation award prior to the
Closing, without Purchaser's consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The provisions of this _Section 1.07_ shall
not affect the right of Purchaser not to consummate the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement because obligations or conditions contained in
_Section 6.08_ have not been fulfilled.

(b) _General Liability or Similar Insurance_. If Company or
Purchaser receives proceeds from a general liability insurance policy or
other similar form of insurance maintained by Company after the Closing Date
for an act that arose on or prior to the Closing Date, such insurance
proceeds shall be (i) Assets (and shall not be Excluded Assets), if such
proceeds relate to an Excluded Liability that has not been fully and
irrevocably released or satisfied or if such proceeds relate to an Included
Liability, and therefore retained by Company provided that Company shall
apply any such proceeds received with respect to such Excluded Liability to
the payment of such Excluded Liability (and if such insurance proceeds exceed
the amount required fully and irrevocably to release or satisfy the
applicable Excluded Liability, then the excess proceeds shall be treated as
provided in the immediately following subsections (ii) and (iii)); (ii)
Excluded Assets (and shall not be Assets), if such proceeds relate to an
Excluded Liability that has been fully and irrevocably released or satisfied,
and therefore such proceeds shall be promptly paid to Seller; and (iii) if
the proceeds relate to a Loss subject to indemnity by a Seller Party, then
such proceeds shall be retained by Purchaser to reduce the amount of any
indemnification obligation of Seller with respect to such Loss or Excluded
Liability hereunder, or if the applicable item of Loss has previously been
fully and irrevocably released or paid and satisfied by Seller, distributed
to Seller to be applied to reimburse such indemnification payments.

  



  

(c) _Insurance Proceeds to be Retained by Seller (or to be
Delivered to Other Third Parties)_. Any insurance proceeds arising from any
insured peril that occurs with respect to any of the Excluded Assets, to the
extent such proceeds are received by Company or Purchaser after the Closing
Date, shall be promptly paid over to Seller (or other applicable third party
entitled to same) for the benefit and on behalf of Seller (or other
applicable third party entitled to same) regardless of when they are received.

  



  

1.08 _Uncashed Tickets_. At the Closing, Seller shall make a cash
payment to or in favor of Purchaser (or at Purchaser's option, to Company) in
an amount equal to, or the Purchase Price shall be decreased by an amount
equal to, the amount of the total Liabilities of Company associated with
uncashed, unclaimed or abandoned tickets, gaming chips, tokens and similar
gaming Liabilities outstanding (collectively, " _Uncashed Tickets_ ") on the
Closing Date made by wagers for bets placed at the Business on live events
held at the Business. In addition, at the Closing, Seller shall make a cash
payment to Purchaser (or at Purchaser's option, to Company) in an amount
equal to the aggregate dollar amount of Uncashed Tickets from inter-track
wagers placed on live events held at the Business prior to the Closing (the "
_Offsite Wagering_ ") which are outstanding on the Closing Date. Further,
Seller shall transfer to Purchaser (or at Purchaser's option, to Company) at
the Closing all cash proceeds derived from Uncashed Tickets outstanding on
the Closing Date from inter-track wagers placed on events not held at
the Business.

1.09 _Determination of Cash on Hand at Closing; Pre-Closing Checks_.
Pursuant to _Section 1.04_ hereof, the Purchase Price shall be increased by
the amount of Company's cash on hand at the Facilities as of the close of
business (i.e., 11:59 P.M., E.T.) on the Closing Date (the " _Cash on Hand_
"), provided that such increased amount of the Purchase Price that reflects
the amount of Cash on Hand shall be payable at the times set forth in this
Section 1.09 and not on the Closing Date. The Seller Parties represent that
(i) approximately $2,000,000 in Cash on Hand is maintained at the Miami Jai
Alai Facility in the Ordinary Course of Business and used in connection with
the daily operations of the Business; and approximately $100,000 in Cash on
Hand is maintained at the Ft. Pierce Jai Alai Facility in the Ordinary Course
of Business and used in connection with the daily operations of the
Business. Seller and Purchaser will mutually designate individuals who will
jointly count and mutually agree on the balance of the Cash on Hand.
Purchaser will pay to Seller within two (2) Business Days after the Closing
Date an amount equal to the Cash on Hand that has been mutually agreed upon
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such accounts as Seller may
reasonably direct by written notice delivered to Purchaser at least two (2)
Business Days before the Closing Date. If the parties are unable to agree
upon the amount of the Cash on Hand, Purchaser shall make such payment of the
amount of Cash on Hand which is undisputed by the parties in the time frame
and manner as set forth above and may delay the payment of such disputed

Documents that it has so filed or furnished prior to the date hereof. As of
their respective filing dates (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent
filing, as of the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing prior
to the date hereof), each of the SEC Documents complied as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and the Exchange Act, and the
rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such SEC Documents.
None of the SEC Documents, including any financial statements, schedules or
exhibits included or incorporated by reference therein at the time they were
filed (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing, as of the date of
the last such amendment or superseding filing prior to the date hereof),
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Company is not required to file or furnish any forms, reports
or other documents with the SEC.

  



  

(b) Seller has designed and maintains a system of internal controls
over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting for Seller and Company. Seller's system of
internal control over financial reporting is designed in all material respects
to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures are being made only
in accordance with the authorization of management or Seller's Board of
Directors, as applicable, and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection
of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Seller's assets that
could have a material effect on Seller's financial statements.

(c) Seller has designed and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by Seller
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to Seller's
management as appropriate to make the certifications required by Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Seller has disclosed to Seller's auditors
(A) any significant deficiencies, material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respect Seller's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Seller's internal controls over
financial reporting. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant
deficiency" and "material weakness" shall have the meaning assigned to them
in Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 2, as in
effect on the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Each of the principal executive officer of Seller and the
principal financial officer of Seller (or each former principal
executive officer of Company and each former principal financial officer of
Company, as applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14
or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act with respect to Seller's SEC Documents, and the statements
contained in such certifications are true and accurate in all material
respects. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and
"principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither Seller nor Company nor, to the Knowledge of
Seller Parties, any of their respective directors, officers, auditors,
accountants or representatives has received or has otherwise become aware of
any substantive complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, that Seller or Company has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices. No current or former attorney representing Seller or
Company has reported evidence of a material violation of securities Laws,
breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Seller or Company or any of
their respective officers, directors, employees or agents, to the current
Seller Board or any committee thereof or to any current director or executive
officer of Seller or Company.

  



  

(e) Neither Seller nor Company is a party to, or has any commitment
to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet partnership or any
similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement relating to any
transaction or relationship between Seller or Company, on the one hand, and
any unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any "off
balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation
S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of
such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving,
or material liabilities of, Seller or Company in the Financial Statements or
other SEC Documents.

2.33 _Proxy Statement_. The proxy statement of Seller to be filed
with the SEC in connection with the Sale (such proxy statement, as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and any amendments
or supplements thereto will, when filed, comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. At the time the
Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto is first mailed to
shareholders of Seller, and at the time such shareholders vote on adoption of
this Agreement and at the Closing, the Proxy Statement, as supplemented or
amended, if applicable, will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The representations and warranties contained in
this _Section 2.33_ will not apply to statements or omissions included in
the Proxy Statement based upon information furnished to Seller in writing by
Purchaser specifically for use therein.

  



  

2.34 _Required Vote_. The affirmative vote or consent of the holders
of a majority of the outstanding shares of Seller's common stock, par value
$0.20 per share (" _Seller 's Common Stock_"), with respect to which votes are
entitled to be cast in connection with the approval of this Agreement (the "
_Seller Shareholder Approval_ "), is the only vote or consent of the holders
of any class or series of capital stock or other equity interests of Seller
necessary to approve this Agreement or the Sale.

  



  

2.35 _Antitakeover Provisions_. No "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition" or other similar antitakeover Law applies to the
Sale or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements. Neither of the Seller Parties has adopted a shareholder rights
plan, "poison pill" or any similar anti-takeover device.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section
4.08(a)_, if at any time following the Effective Date and prior to
Seller's receipt of the Seller Shareholder Approval (i) Seller has received a
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party and (ii) the Seller
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would be
likely to result in a Superior Proposal, then Seller may (A) furnish
information with respect to Seller and Company to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ that the Seller Parties will not, and Seller will not
allow Company to, and will instruct the Seller Parties' Representatives not
to, disclose any information to such Person without first entering into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) will promptly provide to
Purchaser any information concerning Seller and Company provided to such
other Person which was not previously provided to Purchaser.

  



  

(c) The Seller Parties shall promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) notify Purchaser in the event that Seller, Company or any of
the Seller Parties' Representative receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) any request for information relating to Seller or Company other than
requests for information in the Ordinary Course of Business and unrelated to
an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or
negotiations regarding or which could reasonably be expected to result in an
Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) any information, written or oral, that could be
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the consummation of the Sale. The
Seller Parties shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) provide to
Purchaser a copy of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (or, where
no such copy is available, a reasonable description of the material terms
of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry), including any
modifications thereto. The Seller Parties shall keep Purchaser
reasonably informed on a current basis (and in any event at Purchaser's
request and otherwise no later than 24 hours after the occurrence of any
material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of
any Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including the material terms
and conditions thereof and of any material modification thereto), and any
material developments, discussions and negotiations. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Seller Parties shall promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) notify Purchaser if Seller determines to begin providing information
or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to _Section 4.08(b)_ and shall give advance written notice
of at least five (5) Business Days to Purchaser (the " _Notice Period_ ")
before effecting a Change of Recommendation relating to a Superior
Proposal pursuant to clause (x) of _Section 4.08(d)_ or terminating this
Agreement pursuant to clause (y) of _Section 4.08(d)_ (which notice shall
specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal,
including the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section
4.08(a)_, if Seller receives an Acquisition Proposal which the Seller Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Seller Board may, at
any time prior to Seller's receipt of the Seller Shareholder Approval (x)
effect a Change of Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal, or
(y) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal, in each case so long as it has determined
in good faith after consultation with outside counsel and after giving due
consideration to all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be
offered by Purchaser, that such action would be required by its fiduciary
duties to the shareholders of Seller under applicable Law; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Seller Board may not effect a Change of Recommendation
relating to a Superior Proposal pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless Seller
shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its Representatives (including
members of the Seller Board and its advisors) to negotiate during the
Notice Period with Purchaser in good faith to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal.

  



  

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.08_ shall prohibit the
Seller Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the shareholders of Seller a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or making a statement contemplated by
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Seller Board has
reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the shareholders of Seller under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act other than a "stop, look and
listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition
Proposal or an express reaffirmation of its recommendation to its shareholders
in favor of approval of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a Change of
Recommendation.

  



  

4.09 _Fulfillment of Conditions_. Each of the Seller Parties, as
applicable, (a) will execute and deliver at the Closing each Ancillary
Agreement, certificate, document and instrument that it is hereby required to
execute and deliver as a condition to Closing, (b) will take all commercially
reasonable steps necessary or desirable and proceed diligently and in good
faith (i) to satisfy each condition to the obligations of Purchaser contained

Agreement.

4.10 _Noncompetition_.

  



  

(a) Seller will, for a period of three (3) years from the Closing
Date ( _provided_ _that_ with respect to the confidentiality obligations set
forth in Section 4.10(a)(ii) below, Seller's obligation hereunder shall
continue indefinitely), refrain from, either alone or in conjunction with any
other Person, or directly or indirectly through any of their present or future
Affiliates:

  



  

(i) causing or attempting to cause (A) any client, customer or
supplier of the Business or Company to terminate or materially reduce its
business with Company or Purchaser; or (B) any officer, Employee or
consultant of Company, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates to resign or
sever a relationship with Company, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates;

  



  

(ii) disclosing (unless compelled by judicial or administrative
process) or using any confidential or secret information or proprietary
information relating to the Business, Company or any client, customer or
supplier of the Business, Company; or

  



  

(iii) directly or indirectly, engaging, or participating in, or having
any interest as a shareholder, partner, joint venturer, proprietor,
employee, officer, director, agent, security holder, creditor or consultant,
or in any other capacity (other than through the ownership of 5% or less of
any class of securities registered under the Exchange Act, as amended), or
having any other direct or indirect financial interest in or in connection
with, the business or operations of any business, firm, person, partnership,
corporation, enterprise or concern, which owns or operates a jai alai
facility within a 100 mile radius of Miami-Dade County, Florida, St. Lucie
County, Florida or Hillsborough County, Florida.

  



  

(b) For a period of three (3) years following the Closing, Seller
shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit, induce or encourage any employee
or consultant or group of employees or consultants who are then employed or
retained by Company or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates to leave the
faithful employment of or terminate consultation with any of Company,
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates.

  



  

(c) The parties hereto recognize that the Laws and public policies
of the various states of the United States may differ as to the validity and
enforceability of covenants similar to those set forth in this Section. It is
the intention of the parties that the provisions of this Section be enforced
to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and policies of each
jurisdiction in which enforcement may be sought, and that the
unenforceability (or the modification to conform to such Laws or policies) of
any provisions of this Section shall not render unenforceable, or impair, the
remainder of the provisions of this Section. Accordingly, if any provision of
this Section shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, such
invalidity or unenforceability shall be deemed to apply only with respect to
the operation of such provision in the particular jurisdiction in which such
determination is made and not with respect to any other provision or
jurisdiction. If any of the covenants contained in this _Section 4.10_ , or
any part thereof, is held to be unenforceable because of the duration of such
provisions or the area covered thereby, Seller agrees that the court making
such determination shall have the power to reduce the duration and the area or
both of any such provision and, in its reduced form, said provision shall
then be enforceable. The parties hereto intend to and hereby confer
jurisdiction to enforce the covenants contained in this _Section 4.10_ upon
the courts of any Florida court within the geographical scope of
such covenants. The parties acknowledge and agree that on and after the
Closing, Purchaser shall be deemed to become the owner of the confidential
information and proprietary information described in the Letter of Intent as
it relates to the Assets or the Business owned by Company.

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any remedy at Law
for any breach of the provisions of this _Section 4.10_ would be inadequate,
and Seller hereby consents to the granting by any court of an injunction or
other equitable relief, without the necessity of actual monetary loss being
proved, in order that the breach or threatened breach of such provisions may
be effectively restrained. Seller acknowledges and agrees that the scope and
duration of the provisions of this _Section 4.10_ are reasonable in all
respects.

  



  

4.11 _Notice and Cure_. Each Seller Party will notify Purchaser in
writing of, and contemporaneously will provide Purchaser with true
and complete copies of any and all information or documents relating to, and
will use all commercially reasonable efforts to cure before the Closing, any
event, transaction or circumstance, promptly after it becomes known to it,
occurring after the date of this Agreement that causes any covenant or
agreement of any Seller Party under this Agreement to be breached or that
renders untrue any representation or warranty of any Seller Party contained
in this Agreement as if the same were made on or as of the date of such event,
transaction or circumstance. No notice or update given pursuant to this
Section shall have any effect on the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement for purposes of
determining satisfaction of any condition contained herein or shall in any
way limit (i) Purchaser's rights and remedies against any Seller Parties with
respect to such breach or inaccuracy nor (ii) any Purchaser Indemnified
Party's right to seek indemnity under _Article XI_.

  



  

4.12 _Employees_. Following the issuance of the press release
announcing the existence of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein, the Seller Parties and Purchaser shall hold joint meetings with all
Employees to provide preliminary information relating to this transaction,
and thereafter, the Seller Parties shall provide Purchaser with access to all
Employees upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Prior to
the date of such joint meeting with all Employees, Purchaser shall be entitled
to conduct one-on-one meetings with select employees employed by Company in
connection with the Business on or after the date of this Agreement at such
times as Purchaser shall reasonably request, and at such location in Miami,
Florida and Ft. Pierce, Florida as shall be reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser and Company. In connection therewith, the Seller Parties shall
provide Purchaser with access to complete personnel files of all employees
employed by Company on or after the date of this Agreement provided such
access and disclosure does not violate any Laws. Following the issuance of
the press release discussed above, the parties may mutually agree that
Company provide Purchaser with space at the Real Property upon which Purchaser
may establish an information center to be staffed and equipped by Purchaser
at its sole cost and expense. Purchaser shall also be entitled to make general
distributions to all Employees of newsletters, company brochures and other
information relating to this transaction and their operations and the
operations of their Affiliates. Such distributions may include distributions
through the information center or by direct mail to the Employees. Within ten
(10) days prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall provide Company (i) a written
list of all Employees of Company that Purchaser intends for Company, as
applicable, to continue to employ immediately after the Closing (collectively,
the " _Continuing Employees_ "); and (ii) a written list of all Employees
that Purchaser does not intend for Company, as applicable, to retain as of
the Closing (collectively, the " _Affected Employees_ "), and the parties
agree that Purchaser may cause Company at or immediately following the
Closing, to terminate all existing employment agreements or arrangements with
the Affected Employees effective on or immediately following the Closing, and
Seller shall be liable for all severance, vacation pay, and accrued
compensation relating to such terminated Employees. While it is the current
intention of Purchaser to cause Company to continue to employ the Continuing
Employees on an at-will basis following the Closing, the parties acknowledge
and agree that Purchaser and Company have and retain the right to terminate
any such Continuing Employee at any time at or after the Closing. Seller shall
not interfere or compete with Company or Purchaser with respect to the
employment of any Employee by Company or Purchaser after the Closing, and
shall cooperate with Company or Purchaser with respect to the employment of
Employees by Company or Purchaser. The Seller Parties represent and warrant
that except pursuant to the Player Contracts and the Union Agreement, no
Contract restricts the ability of Company to terminate the employment of the
Affected Employees and no such termination will result in any Liability for
severance, vacation pay or other compensation under any Contract or
arrangement.

4.13 _Transition Cooperation_. It is the intention of Purchaser that
Purchaser be in a position to operate Company and the Business
immediately following the Closing. Seller agrees to cooperate with Purchaser
to effect the orderly transition at Closing from Company's accounting,
payroll, human resources, general ledger, point of sale and similar
information technology/information systems to those of Purchaser. In that
regard, each of the Seller Parties agrees to cooperate with Purchaser prior to
Closing in effecting such system conversions including any necessary testing,
installations, runthroughs, data input and the like on Purchaser's
communications equipment, human resources, data lines, information
technology/information, network, inventory, accounts receivable, payroll
and any other systems or networks to effect a smooth transition of the
Business as of the Closing.

  



  

4.14 _Conveyance of Portions of the Real Property_. Seller further
covenants that on or before the Closing, it shall cause the portions of
the Real Property that are currently owned by Seller (as indicated on
_Schedule 2.13(a)_ ) to be conveyed to Company.

  



  

ARTICLE V

subject to the Schedule B-2 exceptions therein (the " _Exceptions_ "), upon
satisfaction of the Schedule B-1 requirements therein. Purchaser will have

and ordinances affecting the Real Property, (iii) those Exceptions accepted by

Exceptions_ "). If Purchaser determines, in its sole and absolute discretion,
that any Exception is unacceptable, Purchaser will notify Seller in writing on
or before the Due Diligence Termination Date of Purchaser's objections (the "
_Objection Notice_ "). If Purchaser timely delivers the Objection Notice to
Seller, Seller will use reasonable good faith efforts to cure the title
matters described in the Objection Notice prior to Closing. In the event that

terminating this Agreement by written notice to Seller, in which event this
Agreement shall be cancelled, the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser, and

to the matters contained in this Agreement, except for those matters which
survive the termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Agreement to the contrary, at the Closing, Seller shall be
obligated to: (a) discharge, satisfy and/or caused to be dismissed, as

9.05 below), it being agreed by Seller that the creation of any such
Exceptions shall be prohibited by the terms of this Agreement; (c) cause all
Schedule B-1 Requirements set forth in the Title Commitment to be satisfied,
except for those pertaining to Purchaser, any Tenants in possession of the
Real Property pursuant to their Real Property Leases; and (d) cause all pre-

will have the right, from time to time, to obtain (and deliver to Seller a
copy of) an endorsement bringing the effective date of the Title Commitment

(" _Additional Title Defects_ "), then Purchaser shall have the right to
object to such Additional Title Defects by providing written notice of same
to Seller, within the earlier of (i) ten (10) Business Days after receipt of

delivers notice of such Additional Title Defects to Seller, Seller will use
reasonable good faith efforts to cure such Additional Title Defects prior to
Closing; provided that Purchaser, as determined in it sole and
absolute discretion, shall have the right, from time to time, to extend the
Closing for a period not longer than 150 days in order for Seller to cure
such Additional Title Defects. In the event that Seller, using reasonable good
faith efforts, is unable to timely cure such Additional Title Defects, then
Purchaser shall have the option of either (x) proceeding to Closing and
accepting title to the Property "as is", without diminution in the Purchase
Price, or (y) terminating this Agreement by written notice to Seller, in

form and substance satisfactory to Purchaser. In addition, Purchaser may
cause the new survey or updated Surveys to be prepared and be certified as
having been prepared in accordance with "ALTA/ACSM Land Title Surveys". To

shall give Company an Objection Notice in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 9.01_ on or before the Due Diligence Termination Date The Seller
Parties shall respond to such Objection Notice in accordance with _Section
9.01_ , and Purchaser shall have the same rights and remedies set forth in

Defects and Purchaser shall have the right to object to such Additional Title
Defects by providing written notice of same to Seller, within the earlier of
(i) ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such Updated Survey or (ii) the
Closing Date. If Purchaser timely delivers notice of such Additional Title
Defects to Seller, Seller will use reasonable good faith efforts to cure such
Additional Title Defects prior to Closing; provided that Purchaser, as
determined in it sole and absolute discretion, shall have the right, from time
to time, to extend the Closing for a period not longer than 150 days in order
for Seller to cure such Additional Title Defects. In the event that Seller,
using reasonable good faith efforts, is unable to timely cure such Additional
Title Defects, then Purchaser shall have the option of either (x) proceeding
to Closing and accepting title to the Property "as is", without diminution in
the Purchase Price, or (y) terminating this Agreement by written notice to
Seller, in which event this Agreement shall be cancelled, the Deposit shall
be returned to Purchaser, and neither party shall have any further obligations
to each other with respect to the matters contained in this Agreement, except
for those matters which survive the termination of this Agreement.

shall be obligated to cure any such Additional Title Defects to the extent
provided in the last sentence of _Section 9.01_ above; and (ii) in the event
that any such Additional Title Defects are the result of a default by Seller
under the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, _Section
9.01_ above, then nothing in this _Section 9.05_ shall affect Purchaser's
rights or remedies with respect to such default.

(b) Subject to the other Sections of this _Article XI_, Purchaser
shall indemnify Seller Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold each of
them harmless for, from and against any and all Losses suffered, incurred or
sustained by any of them or to which any of them becomes subject, resulting
from, arising out of or relating to (i) any breach of representation or
warranty or nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement
on the part of Purchaser contained in this Agreement, or (ii) an
Included Liability.

  



  

(c) The remedies provided in this _Section 11.01_ will not be
exclusive of or limit any other remedies that may be available to
any Indemnified Party.

  



  

11.02 _Method of Asserting Claim_. All claims for indemnification by
any Indemnified Party under _Section 11.01_ will be asserted and resolved as
follows:

  



  

(a) In the event any claim or demand in respect of which an
Indemnified Party might seek indemnity under _Section 11.01_ is asserted
against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person
other than Seller, Purchaser, Company, or any Affiliate of Seller, Purchaser
or Company (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall deliver a
Claim Notice with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnifying Party will notify the Indemnified Party as soon as practicable
within the Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its
Liability to the Indemnified Party under _Section 11.01_ and whether the
Indemnifying Party desires, at its sole cost and expense, to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim.

  



  

 (i) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend
the Indemnified Party with respect to the Third Party Claim pursuant to this
_Section 11.02(a)_ , then the Indemnifying Party will have the right to
defend, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, such Third Party Claim by
all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be vigorously and
diligently prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or will
be settled at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party (but only with
the consent of the Indemnified Party, in the case of any settlement that
provides for any relief other than the payment of monetary damages as to
which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified in full). The Indemnifying
Party will be deemed to have waived its right to dispute its Liability to the
Indemnified Party under _Section 11.01_ with respect to any Third Party Claim
as to which it elects to control the defense. The Indemnifying Party will
have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise
or settlement thereof provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may, at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, at any time prior to the
Indemnifying Party's delivery of the notice referred to in the first sentence
of this _Section 11.02(a)(i)_, file any motion, answer or other pleadings or
take any other action that the Indemnified Party reasonably believes to be
necessary or appropriate to protect its interests. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnified Party may retain or take over the control of the
defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim the defense of which the
Indemnifying Party has elected to control if the Indemnified Party waives its
right to indemnity under _Section 11.01_ with respect to such Third Party
Claim and the Indemnifying Party is not named as a party to such Third Party
Claim. The Indemnified Party may retain separate counsel to represent it in
any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 11.02(a)(i)_, and the
Indemnified Party will bear its own Costs and Expenses with respect to such
separate counsel except that the Indemnifying Party will pay the all Costs
and Expenses of such separate counsel if (A) in the Indemnified Party's
judgment, it is advisable, based on advice of counsel, for the Indemnified
Party to be represented by separate counsel because a conflict or
potential conflict exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party which makes representation of both parties inappropriate under
applicable standards of professional conduct or (B) the named parties to such
Third Party Claim include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnified Party determines, based on advice of counsel, that
defenses may be available to it that may not be available to the Indemnifying
Party. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 11.02(a)(i)_ to the
contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to retain, assume,
take over or otherwise control any defense or settlement of a Third Party
Claim that (A) involves a claim or claims to which the Indemnified Party
reasonably believes will individually or in the aggregate (i) result in a
material adverse effect on the Indemnified Party's business, liabilities,
financial condition, gaming licenses, operations or results of operations (if
the Indemnified Party is a Purchaser Indemnified Party), or (ii) result in a
Material Adverse Change (if the Indemnified Party is Company), (B) seeks
solely non-monetary relief from the Indemnified Party, (C) involves criminal
allegations with respect to the Indemnified Party, or (D) is one in which the
Indemnifying Party is also a party and joint representation would result in a
conflict of interests or as to the principal allegations there may be legal
defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party.

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party
within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the
Third Party Claim pursuant to _Section 11.02(a)_ , or if the Indemnifying
Party gives such notice but fails to prosecute vigorously and diligently or
settle the Third Party Claim, or if the Indemnifying Party is deemed not
eligible to defend the Third Party Claim under any of the circumstances
described in Section 11.02(a)(i), then the Indemnified Party will have the
right to defend, at the sole Cost and Expense of the Indemnifying Party, the
Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be
prosecuted by the Indemnified Party in good faith or will be settled at the
discretion of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party will have full
control of such defense and proceedings, including any settlement thereof;
provided, however, that if requested by the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party will, at the sole Cost and Expense of the Indemnifying
Party, reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party and its counsel in
contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnified Party is contesting,
or, if appropriate and related to the Third Party Claim in question, in
making any counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third Party Claim,
or any cross-complaint against any Person (other than the Indemnifying Party
or any of its Affiliates). The Indemnifying Party may retain separate counsel
to represent it in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by
the Indemnified Party pursuant to this clause (ii), and the Indemnifying
Party will bear its own Costs and Expenses with respect to such participation.

  



  

(iii) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it
does not dispute its Liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to the
Third Party Claim under _Section 11.01_ or fails to notify the Indemnified
Party within the Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its
Liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim, the
Loss arising from such Third Party Claim will be conclusively deemed a
Liability of the Indemnifying Party under _Section 11.01_ and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party
on demand following the determination thereof.

(b) In the event any Indemnified Party has a claim under _Section
11.01_ against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity Notice with reasonable
promptness to the Indemnifying Party; provided that the failure by any
Indemnified Party to give such Indemnity Notice shall not impair such party's
rights hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
that it does not dispute the claim described in such Indemnity Notice or
fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period whether the
Indemnifying Party disputes the claim described in such Indemnity Notice, the
Loss arising from the claim specified in such Indemnity Notice will be
conclusively deemed a Liability of the Indemnifying Party under _Section
11.01_ and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to the
Indemnified Party on demand following the determination thereof.

  



  

11.03 _Indemnification Escrow_. Upon notice to Seller,
Purchaser may give one or more Claim Notices or Indemnity Notices under the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement with respect to any amount or amounts to
which Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Party may be entitled under this
_Article XI_. Neither the exercise of nor the failure to give a Claim Notice
or Indemnity Notice under the Indemnification Escrow Agreement will constitute
an election of remedies or limit any Indemnified Party in any manner in the
enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it.

  



  

11.04 _No Contribution by Company Post-Closing; No Obligation to
Company Post-Closing_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any of
the Ancillary Agreements to the contrary, in the event that the Closing
occurs, Company shall have no liability for contribution or otherwise to
Seller based on any covenant, obligation, representation or warranty made
under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements (including without
limitation as a result of any inaccuracy or breach thereof), and Seller
hereby irrevocably releases and waives any right to contribution or any other
rights it may have against Company as a result of any covenant, obligation,
representation or warranty made by Company under this Agreement or any of the
Ancillary Agreements (including without limitation as a result of any
inaccuracy or breach thereof) or as a result of Seller's agreement to
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under this Agreement or any of the
Ancillary Agreements, and Seller hereby irrevocably releases Company from any
and all such Liabilities.

  



  

(b) Furthermore, notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements to the contrary, in the event
that the Closing occurs, Purchaser shall have no Liability or Obligation to
Company based on any covenant, obligation, representation or warranty made
under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements (including without
limitation as a result of any inaccuracy or breach thereof), and Company
hereby irrevocably releases and waives any right it may have against Purchaser
as a result of any covenant, obligation, representation or warranty made by
Purchaser under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements
(including without limitation as a result of any inaccuracy or breach
thereof) or as a result of Purchaser's agreement to indemnify the Seller
Indemnified Parties under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements,
and Company hereby irrevocably releases Purchaser from any and all such
Liabilities.

requirement for consent by any party, and upon such assignment and/or

and if the rights or obligations of any party hereto under this Agreement will

14.16 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as herein expressly provided,
the remedies provided herein shall be cumulative and shall not preclude
assertion by any party hereto of any other rights or the seeking of any other
remedies against any other party hereto. The parties hereto agree that the
Business is a unique asset and that damages suffered by Purchaser as a result
of a breach of this Agreement by Company would be impracticable to determine.
Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that Purchaser shall be entitled to seek
specific performance of the terms of this Agreement in the event of a breach
of the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

14.17 _Alternative Structure; Section 363 Sale_.

  



  

(a) In the event that Shares cannot be sold, transferred, assigned
or conveyed by Seller to Purchaser on or before the Expiration Time in the
manner and under the terms contemplated in this Agreement (including with the
Shares being sold to Purchaser free and clear of any Liens), or in the event
that such sale would be impossible or impracticable, with the use of
commercially reasonable efforts, to be accomplished in such manner and terms
on or before the Expiration Time, then at Purchaser's written request,
which Purchaser may exercise or not in its sole and absolute discretion, the
parties will cooperate in good faith to revise the structure of the
transaction into an asset purchase transaction or other alternative form of
transaction as may be requested by Purchaser (in each case, an " _Alternative
Structure Transaction_ "); _provided, that,_ any such Alternative
Structure Transaction shall be designed to mirror the economic and
substantive elements of this Agreement and not alter in any material
respect the substantive effect of the allocation of risks and benefits to the
parties under this Agreement, including not (i) increasing or decreasing in
any material respect the Assets to be purchased, or the Included Liabilities
to be assumed, by Purchaser, or the Excluded Liabilities or Excluded Assets
to be retained by Seller, or the Purchase Price, (ii) increasing the breadth
or scope of the representations, warranties or covenants of the parties
(other than non-material changes to reflect the revised form of
the transaction), (iii) increasing the aggregate amount of Tax liabilities to
be borne by any of the parties beyond that contemplated in this Agreement, or
(iv) increasing the indemnification obligations of any party hereto. In the
event the transaction is restructured as contemplated by this paragraph, the
parties shall negotiate consistent with the foregoing the new form of
acquisition agreement for the Alternative Structure Transaction. In the event
the new form of transaction/acquisition agreement requires changes to
the disclosure schedule of any of the parties hereto, such disclosure
schedule shall be updated and any change from the original
disclosure schedule delivered by a party that is solely attributable to the
new form of the transaction or the new acquisition agreement shall be deemed
to qualify _ab initio_ the original disclosure schedule delivered by that
party hereunder.

(b) In the event that Seller and/or Company files a voluntary
petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code (the " _Bankruptcy Code_ ") in any U.S. Bankruptcy Court (the
" _Bankruptcy Court_ ") or an involuntary proceeding under the Bankruptcy
Code is filed against Seller and/or Company in any U.S. Bankruptcy Court which
proceeding is not dismissed within sixty (60) days or which Seller or
Company, as applicable, consents to the entry of an order of relief ("
_Bankruptcy Proceedings_ "), then the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement shall be consummated under the terms and conditions of this
Agreement in the Bankruptcy Proceedings under Bankruptcy Code Section 363 as a
sale of the Shares, in the case of a Bankruptcy Proceeding in which Seller is
the debtor (a " _Seller Bankruptcy Proceeding_ ") or as an asset sale under
the Alternative Structure Transaction provisions, in the case of a Bankruptcy
Proceeding in which Company is the debtor (a " _Company Bankruptcy
Proceeding_ ") (either such sale being a " _Section 363 Sale_ "), with such
revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that may be necessary
to effectuate the Section 363 Sale; _provided_   _however_ , that, (i) any
such revision shall be consistent with the parameters set forth in Section
14.17(a), above, with respect to an Alternative Structure Transaction; and
(ii) the following additional provisions shall be deemed automatically
added to this Agreement (the " _Section 363 Sale Provisions_
")(notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained in this Agreement, the
Section 363 Sale Provisions shall not become applicable, and shall have no
force or effect, until and unless a Bankruptcy Proceeding has been filed and
is in effect):

  



  

(i) _Purchaser 's Conditions_. In addition to the conditions set
forth in the Agreement, Purchaser's obligation to consummate the Section 363
Sale shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver, prior to the Closing, of
the following: The Bankruptcy Court presiding over the Bankruptcy Proceedings
shall have entered a final non-appealable order approving the sale under this
Agreement and the assumption by Purchaser and assignment to Purchaser of the
Included Contracts to which Purchaser exercises its right to so assume (the "
_Approval Order_ "), whose form and substance shall be reasonably satisfactory
to Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller or Company, as applicable, on the
other hand, authorizing the sale of the Assets to Purchaser free and clear,
pursuant to Bankruptcy Code Section 363(f), of all Liens, claims, and
interests, except as provided in this Agreement, and finding Purchaser to be
a good faith purchaser within the meaning of 11 USC §363(m).

  



  

(ii) _Seller and/or Company 's Conditions_. _ _In addition to the
conditions set forth in the Agreement, Seller's or Company's obligation, as
applicable, to consummate the Section 363 Sale shall be subject to the
satisfaction or waiver, prior to the Closing, of the following: The Bankruptcy
Court presiding over the Bankruptcy Proceedings shall have entered the
Approval Order, whose form and substance shall be reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller or Company, as applicable, on the
other hand, authorizing the sale of the Shares or the Assets to
Purchaser free and clear, pursuant to Bankruptcy Code Section 363(f), of any
liens, claims, and interests, except as provided in this Agreement, and
finding Purchaser to be a good faith purchaser within the meaning of 11 USC
§363(m).

  



  

(iii) _Break-Up Fee_. Seller and Company acknowledges Purchaser has
expended, and will expend, considerable sums and time to perform due
diligence on Seller and Company and analyze the historical and present
operations of Seller and Company. Accordingly, in the event Purchaser is not
in default hereunder and is ready, willing, and able to close on the purchase
in the Section 363 Sale, and should Seller and/or Company, as applicable,
accept a higher or better offer to sell the Shares or the Assets, as
applicable, to another purchaser (" _Alternative Purchaser_ ") which sale is
approved by the Bankruptcy Court in the Bankruptcy Proceedings, then, Seller
and Company agree that Purchaser shall be entitled to receive Two Million and
No/100 Dollars ($2,000,000.00) as a break-up fee to reimburse Purchaser for
the value of its time, costs, and expenses incurred in connection with this
transaction (the " _Break-Up Fee_ "). The Break-Up Fee shall be entitled to
status as an administrative expense under Bankruptcy Code section 501(b)(1)
and shall be secured by a Lien on the deposit of the Alternative Purchaser or
the closing proceeds in the event the transaction with the Alternative
Purchaser closes. Any sums becoming payable to Purchaser pursuant to this
Section 14.17(b)(iii) shall be paid to Purchaser simultaneously with the
closing to any such Alternative Purchaser approved in the Bankruptcy
Proceedings or, if applicable, when the deposit on such transaction is
forfeited. In no event, however, shall any Break Up Fee be payable to
Purchaser if no closing occurs with respect to a sale by Seller and/or
Company, on the one hand, and the Alternative Purchaser, on the other hand,
if the Alternative Purchaser's deposit related thereto is not forfeited (it
being understood and agreed that the Break Up Fee shall only be payable out
of either the sale proceeds or deposit and not the debtor's other assets).

Bankruptcy Proceeding, Seller and/or Company, as applicable, shall file a
motion (the " _Sale Motion_ ") pursuant to sections 363 and 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code seeking entry of an order, among other things, (i)
authorizing the sale of the Shares or the Assets, as applicable, and all of
the other assets and properties of Seller and/or Company, as applicable
(i.e., the Excluded Assets), on substantially the terms and conditions set

applicable, resulting from the Auction, and (v) approving the form and
manner of notice of the Sale Motion and Sale Hearing.

  



  

(v) _Bidding Procedures Order_. Seller and/or Company, as
applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain entry of an
order (the " _Bidding Procedures Order_ ") approving the Sale Motion, and to
set the earliest possible hearing date for the Sale Hearing, and in all
events the hearing on the Bidding Procedures Order shall be held not less than
ten (10) days before the scheduled Auction. The Bidding Procedures Order and
any order approving the sale to Purchaser (the " _Sale Order_ ") shall be in
form and content reasonably satisfactory to Seller and/or Company, as
applicable, and Purchaser and shall provide, among other things, the
following:

  



  

(A) that the hearing to consider entry of the Bankruptcy Court
approval (the " _Sale Hearing_ ") shall be set not later than April 30, 2013;

  



  

(B) that the Bidding Procedures shall include a requirement that
there be minimum bidding increments of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and
No/100 Dollars ($250,000.00), which would require an initial offer from a
third party to offer consideration equal to the Purchase Price, plus the
Break-Up Fee of Two Million and No/100 Dollars ($2,000,000.00), plus the
minimum bidding increment of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars
($250,000.00).

  



  

(C) that a proposal for a competing bid must be in writing and
evidenced by a written agreement specifying without limitation, the price and

(D) subject to the foregoing provisions, that the Bidding Procedures
shall govern the terms and conditions of competing bids and of the Sale and
the Auction;

  



  

(E) that Seller and/or Company, as applicable, will commence the
Auction pursuant to the time schedule set forth in the Bidding
Procedures. The Auction shall be concluded and the highest and best offer
determined and announced at the conclusion of the Auction,
which determination and announcement shall be final (subject to the Sale
Order);

  



  

(F) that a bid by any Alternative Purchaser will not be considered by
Seller and/or Company, as applicable, as qualified for the Auction if such
bid or other information submitted by the bidder does not contain satisfactory
evidence that the Person submitting it has sufficient financial wherewithal
to consummate the purchase contemplated thereby;

  



  

(G) that any Alternative Purchaser submitting a competing bid to
provide an earnest money cash deposit (the " _Alternative
Purchaser\'s Deposit_ ") in accordance with the Bidding Procedures of an
amount not less than the Break Up Fee, and Seller and/or Company, as
applicable, shall cause the Alternative Purchaser to place the Alternative
Purchaser\'s Deposit (in the amount of Break-Up Fee) in cash in escrow with
the counsel for Seller and/or Company, as applicable, for payment to Purchaser
subject to the terms of this Agreement, provided that Seller and/or Company,
as applicable, has not previously notified Purchaser in writing that it is in
material breach of this Agreement;

  



  

(H) that if one or more bids are submitted in accordance with the
Bidding Procedures (the " _Qualified Bids_ "), Seller and/or Company, as
applicable, will conduct the Auction pursuant to the time schedule set forth
in the Bidding Procedures. At the Auction, Purchaser shall submit this
Agreement as its initial bid (or any higher or better bid amount in excess of
the Purchase Price and terms of this Agreement), and Seller and/or Company,
as applicable, shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to select
the highest and best bid from Purchaser and any Alternative Purchaser who
submitted a Qualified Bid (the "Highest and Best Bid"), subject to resolution
of any dispute by the Bankruptcy Court;

  



  

(I) that only the Persons who submitted Qualified Bids and any other
Person permitted to participate in the Auction by order of the
Bankruptcy Court may participate in the Auction;

  



  

(J) that the Break-Up Fee shall be payable by Seller and/or Company,
as applicable, to Purchaser subject to the other terms of this
Agreement provided that Purchaser submits this Agreement (or a higher price)

an agreement with Seller and/or Company, as applicable, to consummate an

Price; i.e., that would generate Excess Proceeds as defined below) in
accordance with the Bidding Procedures, and consummates such transaction or
suffers the loss of the Alternative Purchaser\'s Deposit, as defined below,
then Purchaser shall be entitled to the Break-Up Fee from the Alternative
Purchaser\'s Deposit, as defined below (or from the proceeds of the
consummated sale in excess of the Purchase Price; the " _Excess Proceeds_ ");

EXECUTION COPY

(L) that in the event of a competing bid, Purchaser shall be entitled
to submit successive overbids and shall be entitled, in the calculation of
the amount of Purchaser\'s overbids, to credit bid in the sum of the Break-Up
Fee (but Purchaser shall be entitled to the Break-Up Fee whether or not it
submits overbids in the Auction); and

  



  

(M) that in the event this Agreement is terminated by Seller and/or
Company, as applicable, for any reason or circumstance other than
termination due to the material and uncured default or breach by Purchaser
when Seller is not in default or breach and has satisfied all conditions to
Closing, and Seller and/or Company, as applicable, consummates a sale of the
Shares or the Assets to any Alternative Purchaser for a price higher than the
Purchase Price within six months of such termination, then Purchaser shall be
entitled to payment from Seller and/or Company, as applicable, of the Break
Up Fee (to the extent of such increased Purchase Price), and Purchaser\'s
right to payment thereof shall be protected and secured with a Lien upon the
proceeds of the Alternative Purchaser\'s deposit or Excess Proceeds.

 _GUARANTEE AND JOINDER_

  



  

This Guarantee and Joinder (this " _Joinder_ ") is made and entered into as
of the 25th day of November, 2012 by WILLIAM B. COLLETT, SR., an individual
resident of the State of Florida and WILLIAM B. COLLETT, JR., an individual
resident of the State of Florida (William B. Collett, Sr. and William B.
Collett, Jr. are collectively referred to herein as the " _Principals,_ " and
each individually as a " _Principal_ "), in favor of SILVERMARK LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" _Purchaser_ "). 

  



  

 _PRELIMINARY STATEMENT_

  



  

Capitalized terms that are used but are not otherwise defined in this Joinder
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Stock
Purchase Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the " _Agreement_ ") between
Purchaser, FLORIDA GAMING CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (" _Seller_ ")
and FLORIDA GAMING CENTERS, INC., a Florida corporation (" _Company_ "). The
Principals are the direct or indirect shareholders of Seller and will derive
substantial benefit from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Agreement. The Principals acknowledge and agree that as a condition to
Purchaser entering into the Agreement with Seller, Purchaser requires that the
Principals execute and deliver this Joinder.

  



  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of and as an inducement to Purchaser entering
into the Agreement with Seller and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt, adequacy and sufficiency of which are hereby conclusively
acknowledged, each of the Principals, intending to be legally bound, hereby
agree in favor of Purchaser as follows:

  



  

Section 1. _Guarantee_.

  



  

(a) The Principals hereby jointly and severally and irrevocably,
absolutely and unconditionally guarantee, as primary obligor and not
merely as surety, the payment and performance of all of Seller's and/or the
Company's agreements, covenants, indemnities and other liabilities and
obligations pursuant to the Agreement and/or any of the Ancillary Agreements.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Principals jointly and
severally agree (i) to pay to Purchaser and each of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties, as applicable, when due all sums due from Seller and/or the Company
pursuant to or in connection with the Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements, including without limitation, the Termination Fee, the Termination
Costs and Expenses, the Termination Payment, the Deposit, the prorations and
credits payable or due by the Seller pursuant to the Agreement, any and all
Losses suffered by Purchaser or any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, as
applicable, the indemnity provided by Seller and/or the Company pursuant to
the Agreement (under Article XI of the Agreement or otherwise), and the
amount of any judgment or award that may be obtained by any of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties against Seller and/or the Company in connection with the
Agreement, inclusive of interest on any such award, and (ii) to perform or
cause to be performed any obligation of Seller and/or the Company pursuant to
the Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements in accordance with the terms
of the Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, as applicable.

  



  

(b) Each Principal hereby agrees that in the event of any breach or
default by Seller and/or the Company under the Agreement or any of
the Ancillary Agreements, Purchaser shall be entitled to proceed against each
Principal immediately for such payment and performance without prior demand
or notice. Each Principal expressly waives presentment, demand, protest,
notice of default and non-payment, and all other notices or demands of any
kind in connection with the delivery, acceptance, performance, default or
enforcement of this Joinder, and consents to any extension or modification of
the terms of the Agreement without notice. All payments under this Joinder
shall be made without counterclaim, offset or defense of any kind, and each
Principal hereby waives any and all defenses and rights of set off that it
may have under applicable law.

  



   


--- 

 

EXECUTION COPY 
--- 

    



  

(c) This is an irrevocable, absolute, continuing guaranty of payment
and performance ( _inter_ _alia_ ) and not merely a guaranty of collection;
and each Principal waives any right to require that any action be brought
against Seller and/or the Company or any other Person or to require that
resort be had to any security. Each right, power and remedy of Purchaser
and/or any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties provided for in this Joinder
or the Agreement or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity, by statute
or otherwise shall be cumulative and concurrent and shall be in addition to
every other such right, power or remedy. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Party may, at its
option, proceed against each Principal individually, in the first instance to
collect any monies, the payment of which is guaranteed hereby, without first
proceeding against Seller and/or the Company or any other Person, and without
first resorting to any security held by it as collateral or to any other
remedies, at the same or different times, as it may deem advisable; and the
liability of each Principal hereunder shall be in no way affected or impaired
by an acceptance by Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Party of any
security for, or other guarantors upon, any indebtedness, liability or
obligation of Seller and/or the Company to Purchaser or any Purchaser
Indemnified Party, or by any failure, delay, neglect or omission by Purchaser
or any Purchaser Indemnified Party to realize upon or protect any such
indebtedness, liability or obligation or any collateral or security therefor.
No failure on the part of Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Party to
exercise and no delay in exercising any right granted hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right
hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right.

  



  

(d) Each Principal agrees to pay all Costs and Expenses of
collection in the enforcement of Purchaser's and each Purchaser
Indemnified Party's rights with respect to Seller's and/or the Company's
Liabilities and obligations and this Joinder, including without limitation,
actual attorneys' fees, paralegals' fees, court costs, other costs expended in
the collection or enforcement process, default interest at the highest rate
permitted by law and such other and further relief as may be proper.

  



  

(e) Whenever possible, each provision of this Joinder shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Joinder is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of this Joinder. All issues and questions concerning the construction,
validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Joinder shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Florida, without
giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions
(whether of the State of Florida or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Florida. Any action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or
based on any right arising out of this Joinder shall be brought against any
of the parties in the courts of the State of Florida, County of Miami-Dade,
or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Florida, and each of the parties consents
to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate
appellate courts) in any such action or proceeding and waives any objection
to venue laid therein. Process in any action or proceeding referred to in the
preceding sentence may be served on any party anywhere in the world.

any provision of this Joinder.

  



  

Section 4.04. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Joinder is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced under applicable
Law, all other conditions and provisions of this Joinder shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated herein are not affected in any manner adverse to
any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Joinder so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated herein are consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 4.05. _Parties in Interest_. This Joinder shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their successors
and assigns, and nothing in this Joinder, except as set forth below, express
or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person (other than the

Section 4.07. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue_. This Joinder shall
be governed by the internal laws of the State of Florida, without giving
effect to the conflicts of laws principles thereof. Each party hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Florida or any court of the State
of Florida located in Miami-Dade County in any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Joinder, the Ancillary Agreements or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and agrees that any such
action, suit or proceeding shall be brought only in such court; _provided,
however_ , that such consent to jurisdiction is solely for the purpose
referred to in this _Section 4.07_ and shall not be deemed to be a general
submission to the jurisdiction of said courts or in the State of Florida other
than for such purpose. Each party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any such action, suit or proceeding brought in
such a court. Each party further irrevocably waives and agrees not to
plead or claim that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in such a

assertion by any party hereto of any other rights or the seeking of any other
remedies against any other party hereto. The parties hereto agree that the
Business is a unique asset and that damages suffered by Purchaser as a result

event of a breach of the terms of this Joinder.

 _EXHIBIT B_

  



  

 _DEPOSIT ESCROW AGREEMENT_

  



  

This DEPOSIT ESCROW AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of November 25,
2012 (the " _Effective Date_ ") among SILVERMARK LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" _Purchaser_ ") or its assignee(s), FLORIDA GAMING
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (" _Seller_ ") and GUNSTER, YOAKLEY and
STEWART, P.A., as escrow agent (" _Escrow Agent_ ").

  



  

This is the Deposit Escrow Agreement referred to in the Stock Purchase
Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), among
Purchaser, Seller, and FLORIDA GAMING CENTERS, INC., a Florida corporation ("
_Company_ "). Capitalized terms used in this Agreement without definition
shall have the respective meanings given to them in the Purchase Agreement.

  



  

The parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Establishment of Escrow_.

  



  

a. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Purchaser is depositing the
Deposit with Escrow Agent an amount equal to Fifty Thousand and NO/100
dollars ($50,000.00) in immediately available funds.

  



  

b. Escrow Agent hereby agrees to hold all of the Deposit in escrow
in an interest-bearing account subject to the terms and conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any interest earned on the Deposit shall be
applied in the same manner as the Deposit.

  



  

2. _Investment of Funds_.

  



  

Except as Purchaser and Seller may from time to time jointly instruct Escrow
Agent in writing, until disbursement of the Deposit as contemplated
under this Agreement, the Deposit shall be invested from time to time, to the
extent possible, in (i) one or more interest bearing deposit accounts (which
may be money market deposit accounts) with one or more financial institutions
as may be selected by Escrow Agent in its sole and absolute discretion,
and/or (ii) U.S. government securities, securities guaranteed by the U.S.
government or insured fixed deposits with one or more financial institutions,
in each case as may be selected by Escrow Agent in its sole and
absolute discretion. Escrow Agent is authorized to liquidate in accordance
with its customary procedures any portion of the Deposit consisting of
investments to provide for payments required to be made under this Agreement.

  



  

3. _Release of Deposit_.

  



  

Escrow Agent agrees to release the Deposit in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement. Subject to the terms of this
_Section 3_ , the Deposit shall be non-refundable to Purchaser in the event
that the Closing fails to occur due to a default under the Purchase Agreement
by Purchaser and the Purchase Agreement is terminated by the Seller Parties
pursuant to _Section 12.01(c)(i)_  of the Purchase Agreement, in which event,
upon such termination of the Purchase Agreement as a result thereof, the
Deposit shall be paid by Escrow Agent to Seller; otherwise, the Deposit shall
be refunded to Purchaser by Escrow Agent in the event that the Closing fails
to occur. Escrow Agent shall be required to obtain the consent of both parties
to release the Deposit pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence,
_provided_ , _however_ , that if Escrow Agent is releasing the Deposit as a
result of the termination of the Purchase Agreement under any provision of
_Section 12.01_ other than a termination by the Seller Parties as provided in
_Section 12.01(c)(i)_ of the Purchase Agreement, then Escrow Agent is not
required to obtain the consent of Seller to release the Deposit, unless
Seller disputes such release by written notice to Escrow Agent which much be
received by Escrow Agent prior to such release.

4. _Duties of Escrow Agent_.

  



  

(a) Escrow Agent shall not be under any duty to give the Deposit
held by it hereunder any greater degree of care than it gives its own
similar property and shall not be required to invest any funds held hereunder
except as directed in this Agreement. Uninvested funds held hereunder shall
not earn or accrue interest.

  



  

(b) Escrow Agent shall not be liable for actions or omissions
hereunder, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct and,
except with respect to claims based upon such gross negligence or willful
misconduct that are successfully asserted against Escrow Agent, the other
parties hereto shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless Escrow
Agent (and any successor Escrow Agent) from and against any and all losses,
liabilities, claims, actions, damages and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys\' fees and disbursements, arising out of and in connection with
this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Escrow Agent shall in no
event be liable in connection with its investment or reinvestment of any cash
held by it hereunder in good faith, in accordance with the terms hereof,
including, without limitation, any liability for any delays (not resulting
from its gross negligence or willful misconduct) in the investment or
reinvestment of the Deposit or any loss of interest incident to any such
delays.

  



  

(c) Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any order, judgment,
certification, demand, notice, instrument or other writing delivered to it
hereunder without being required to determine the authenticity or the
correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety or validity of the
service thereof. Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any instrument or
signature believed by it to be genuine and may assume that the person
purporting to give receipt or advice or make any statement or execute any
document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to
do so. Escrow Agent may conclusively presume that the undersigned
representative of any party hereto which is an entity other than a natural
person has full power and authority to instruct Escrow Agent on behalf of
that party unless written notice to the contrary is delivered to Escrow Agent.

  



  

(d) Escrow Agent may act pursuant to the advice of counsel with
respect to any matter relating to this Agreement and shall not be liable
for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith in accordance with such
advice.

  



  

(e) Escrow Agent does not have any interest in the Deposit deposited
hereunder but is serving as escrow holder only and has only
possession thereof. Any payments of income from the Deposit shall be subject
to withholding regulations then in force with respect to United States taxes.
The parties hereto will provide Escrow Agent with appropriate Internal Revenue
Service Forms W-9 for tax identification number certification, or nonresident
alien certifications. This _Section 4(e)_ and _Section 4(b)_ shall survive
notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement or the resignation of
Escrow Agent.

(f) Escrow Agent makes no representation as to the validity, value,
genuineness or collectability of any security or other document or
instrument held by or delivered to it.

  



  

(g) Escrow Agent shall not be called upon to advise any party as to
the wisdom in selling or retaining or taking or refraining from any
action with respect to any securities or other property deposited hereunder.

  



  

(h) Escrow Agent (and any successor Escrow Agent) may at any time
resign as such by delivering the Deposit to any successor Escrow Agent
jointly designated by the other parties hereto in writing, or to any court of
competent jurisdiction, whereupon Escrow Agent shall be discharged of and
from any and all further obligations arising in connection with this
Agreement. The resignation of Escrow Agent will take effect on the earlier of
(i) the appointment of a successor (including a court of competent
jurisdiction) or (ii) the day which is thirty (30) days after the date of
delivery of its written notice of resignation to the other parties hereto. If,
at that time, Escrow Agent has not received a designation of a successor
Escrow Agent, Escrow Agent\'s sole responsibility after that time shall be to
retain and safeguard the Deposit until receipt of a designation of successor
Escrow Agent or a joint written disposition instruction by the other parties
hereto or a final, nonappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

  



  

(i) In the event of any disagreement between the other parties
hereto resulting in adverse claims or demands being made in connection with
the Deposit or in the event that Escrow Agent is in doubt as to what action it
should take hereunder, Escrow Agent shall be entitled to retain the Deposit
until Escrow Agent shall have received (i) a final, nonappealable order of a
court of competent jurisdiction directing delivery of the Deposit or (ii) a
written agreement executed by the other parties hereto directing delivery of
the Deposit, in which event Escrow Agent shall disburse the Deposit in
accordance with such order or agreement. Any court order shall be accompanied
by a legal opinion by counsel for the presenting party satisfactory to Escrow
Agent to the effect that the order is final and nonappealable. Escrow Agent
shall act on such court order and legal opinion without further question.

  



  

(j) Purchaser and Seller agree to pay and reimburse Escrow Agent for
all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made
by Escrow Agent in performance of its duties hereunder (including reasonable
fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel). Any such payment and
reimbursement to which Escrow Agent is entitled shall be borne fifty percent
(50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser. Any fees, expenses,
disbursements and advances of Escrow Agent or its counsel that are not paid as
provided for herein may be taken from any property held by Escrow Agent
hereunder.

  



  

(k) No printed or other matter in any language (including, without
limitation, prospectuses, notices, reports and promotional material) that
mentions Escrow Agent\'s name or the rights, powers or duties of Escrow Agent
shall be issued by the other parties hereto or on such parties\' behalf
unless Escrow Agent shall first have given its specific written consent
thereto.

(l) The other parties hereto authorize Escrow Agent, for any
securities held hereunder, to use the services of any United States
central securities depository it reasonably deems appropriate, including,
without limitation, the Depository Trust Company and the Federal Reserve Book
Entry System.

  



  

6. _Limited Responsibility_.

  



  

This Agreement expressly sets forth all the duties of Escrow Agent with
respect to any and all matters pertinent hereto. No implied duties or
obligations shall be read into this Agreement against Escrow Agent. Escrow
Agent shall not be bound by the provisions of any agreement among the other
parties hereto except this Agreement.

  



  

7. _Ownership for Tax Purposes_.

  



  

Seller agrees that, for purposes of federal and other taxes based on income,
Seller will be treated as the owner of the Deposit and that Seller
will report all income, if any, that is earned on, or derived from, the
Deposit as its income in the taxable year or years in which such income is
properly includible and pay any taxes attributable thereto.

  



  

8. _Acknowledgement_.

  



  

Seller acknowledges and agrees that Gunster, Yoakley and Stewart, P.A. serves
as legal counsel to Purchaser and/or its Affiliates from time to time and
that nothing contained herein or any performance by the Escrow Agent or any
party hereunder shall impair or affect Gunster, Yoakley and Stewart, P.A.'s
ability and full right and authority to represent Purchaser and/or its
Affiliates in connection with any matter (including, without limitation, any
interpleader action instituted by it as Escrow Agent arising from this
Agreement), whether or not related to the subject matter hereof, nor shall
the Escrow Agent's agreement to act as escrow agent hereunder create any
impropriety or conflict of interest (or any appearance thereof) in connection
with the Escrow Agent's representation of Purchaser and/or its Affiliates. By
signing below, Purchaser, Seller and Escrow Agent acknowledge that they have
read this Agreement and agree to the terms contained herein and, for the
purposes of avoidance of any doubt, Seller hereby expressly waives any claim
of conflict of interest against Gunster, Yoakley and Stewart, P.A. arising from
its status as Escrow Agent hereunder and as counsel to the Purchaser.

  



  

9. _Notices_.

  



  

Unless otherwise provided herein, all notices, Consents, waivers and other

 _INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW AGREEMENT_

  



  

This INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of
___________, 2013 (the " _Closing Date_ ") among SILVERMARK LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (" _Purchaser_ ") or its assignee(s), FLORIDA GAMING
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (" _Seller_ ") and GUNSTER, YOAKLEY and
STEWART, P.A., as escrow agent (" _Escrow Agent_ ").

  



  

This is the Indemnification Escrow Agreement referred to in the Stock
Purchase Agreement dated as of November 25, 2012 (the " _Purchase Agreement_
"), among Purchaser, Seller, and FLORIDA GAMING CENTERS, INC., a Florida
corporation (" _Company_ "). Capitalized terms used in this Agreement without
definition shall have the respective meanings given to them in the Purchase
Agreement.

  



  

The parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Establishment of Escrow_.

  



  

(a) Purchaser is depositing with Escrow Agent an amount equal to
Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand and NO/100 Dollars ($7,500,000.00) in
immediately available funds (as increased by any earnings thereon and as
reduced by any disbursements, amounts withdrawn under Section 5(j), or losses
on investments, the " _Escrow Fund_ ").

  



  

(b) Escrow Agent hereby agrees to act as escrow agent and, upon
receipt of the Escrow Fund, to hold, safeguard and disburse the Escrow
Fund pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof.

  



  

2. _Investment of Funds_.

  



  

Except as Purchaser and Seller may from time to time jointly instruct Escrow
Agent in writing, until disbursement of the Escrow Fund as contemplated under
this Agreement, the Escrow Fund shall be invested from time to time, to the
extent possible, in (i) one or more interest bearing deposit accounts (which
may be money market deposit accounts) with one or more financial institutions
as may be selected by Escrow Agent in its sole and absolute discretion,
and/or (ii) U.S. government securities, securities guaranteed by the
U.S. government or insured fixed deposits with one or more financial
institutions, in each case as may be selected by Escrow Agent in its sole and
absolute discretion. Escrow Agent is authorized to liquidate in accordance
with its customary procedures any portion of the Escrow Fund consisting of
investments to provide for payments required to be made under this Agreement.

  



  

3. _Claims_.

  



  

(a) From time to time on or before [______________, 2016]1,
Purchaser may give one or more Claim Notices, Indemnity Notices or other
notices (each, a " _Notice_ ") to Seller and Escrow Agent with respect to any
one or more claims (each, a " _Claim_ ") that Purchaser or any Purchaser
Indemnified Party may have under Article XI of the Purchase
Agreement; Purchaser may make more than one claim with respect to any
underlying state of facts. Neither the exercise of nor the failure to give a
Claim Notice, Indemnity Notice or such other notice under this Agreement will
constitute an election of remedies or limit any Purchaser Indemnified Party
in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available
to it.

(i) If Seller gives notice to Purchaser and Escrow Agent disputing
any Claim (a " _Counter Notice_ ") within thirty (30) days following receipt
by Escrow Agent of the Notice regarding such Claim, such Claim shall be
resolved as provided in Section 3(b). If no Counter Notice is received by
Escrow Agent within such thirty-day (30-day) period, then the dollar amount of
damages claimed by Purchaser as set forth in its Notice with respect to such
Claim shall be deemed established for purposes of this Agreement and the
Purchase Agreement and, at the end of such thirty-day (30-day) period, Escrow
Agent shall pay to Purchaser (or to the Purchaser Indemnified Party, as
applicable) the dollar amount claimed in the Notice from (and only to the
extent of) the Escrow Fund.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, the
Purchase Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to the contrary, (A) Seller
shall have no right to, and shall not, dispute or deliver a Counter Notice
with respect to any Claim for which Liability has been determined or
established under Article XI of the Purchase Agreement or with respect to any
Claim relating to any matter described under Schedule VIII, Schedule 2.10 or
Schedule 2.11 of the Purchase Agreement, (B) the dollar amount of damages
claimed by Purchaser as set forth in its Notice with respect to such Claim
shall be deemed established upon delivery of such Notice under Section 3(a)
for purposes of this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, and (C) the Escrow
Agent shall pay to Purchaser (or to the Purchaser Indemnified Party, as
applicable) the dollar amount claimed in such Notice, from (and only to the
extent of) the Escrow Fund, within five (5) Business Days after Escrow Agent
receives such Notice under Section 3(a).

  



  

(b) If a Counter Notice is given with respect to a Claim, Escrow
Agent shall make payment with respect thereto only in accordance with (i)
joint written instructions of Purchaser and Seller or (ii) a final,
nonappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Any court order
shall be accompanied by a legal opinion by counsel for the presenting party
satisfactory to Escrow Agent to the effect that the order is final and
nonappealable. Escrow Agent shall act on such court order and legal opinion
without further question.

  



  

(c) Escrow Agent shall not inquire into or consider whether a Claim
complies with the requirements of the Purchase Agreement or this Agreement.

  



  

4. _Termination of Escrow_.

  



  

(a) Commencing on [______________, 2013]2, and on the ___3 day of
each calendar month thereafter until [______________, 2016]4 (each, a "
_Monthly Release Date_ "), Escrow Agent shall pay and distribute to Seller up
to Seventy Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($70,000) from the amount then
remaining in the Escrow Fund, if any (the " _Monthly Release Amount_ "),
unless (i) the amount then remaining in the Escrow Fund equals or is less than
Five Million and No/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00), in which case no Monthly
Release Amount shall be payable, paid or distributed under this Agreement,
(ii) any Claims are then pending on such Monthly Release Date, in which case,
subject to the provisions of clause (iii) of this Section 4(a), the Monthly
Release Amount shall only be paid and distributed to Seller from the amount
then remaining in the Escrow Fund in the event that (x) the amount then
remaining in the Escrow Fund on such Monthly Release Date, _minus_ (y) an
amount equal to the aggregate dollar amount of such Claims (as shown in the
Notices of such Claims), equals or exceeds the Monthly Release Amount, or
(iii) Purchaser has given notice to Seller and Escrow Agent specifying in
reasonable detail (A) the nature of any other claim it may have under Article
XI of the Purchase Agreement with respect to which it is unable to specify the
amount of Losses or potential Losses, or (B) of any outstanding Excluded
Liability or Excluded Litigation with respect to which it is unable
to specify the amount of Losses or potential Losses, in which case the
Monthly Release Amount that is otherwise payable on such Monthly Release Date
hereunder shall not be payable, paid or distributed to Seller. Any right of
Seller to receive payment and distribution of the Monthly Release Amounts
shall not accumulate, and no Monthly Release Amount that is not paid or
distributed in accordance this Section 4(a) shall accrue or become payable at
any time after the applicable Monthly Release Date.

Claims) shall be retained by Escrow Agent in the Escrow Fund (and the balance,
if any, paid to Seller), or (ii) Purchaser has given notice to Seller and
Escrow Agent specifying in reasonable detail (A) the nature of any
other claim it may have under Article XI of the Purchase Agreement with
respect to which it is unable to specify the amount of Losses or potential
Losses, or (B) of any outstanding Excluded Liability or Excluded Litigation
with respect to which it is unable to specify the amount of Losses or
potential Losses, in which case the entire Escrow Fund shall be retained by
Escrow Agent, in either case until it receives joint written instructions of
Purchaser and Seller or a final, nonappealable order of a court of
competent jurisdiction as contemplated by Section 3(b).

  



  

5. _Duties of Escrow Agent_.

  



  

(a) Escrow Agent shall not be under any duty to give the Escrow Fund
held by it hereunder any greater degree of care than it gives its own similar
property and shall not be required to invest any funds held hereunder except
as directed in this Agreement. Uninvested funds held hereunder shall not earn
or accrue interest.

  



  

(b) Escrow Agent shall not be liable for actions or omissions
hereunder, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct and,
except with respect to claims based upon such gross negligence or willful
misconduct that are successfully asserted against Escrow Agent, the other
parties hereto shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless Escrow
Agent (and any successor Escrow Agent) from and against any and all losses,
liabilities, claims, actions, damages and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys\' fees and disbursements, arising out of and in connection with
this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Escrow Agent shall in no
event be liable in connection with its investment or reinvestment of any cash
held by it hereunder in good faith, in accordance with the terms hereof,
including, without limitation, any liability for any delays (not resulting
from its gross negligence or willful misconduct) in the investment or
reinvestment of the Escrow Fund or any loss of interest incident to any such
delays.

(c) Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any order, judgment,
certification, demand, notice, instrument or other writing delivered to it
hereunder without being required to determine the authenticity or the
correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety or validity of the
service thereof. Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any instrument or
signature believed by it to be genuine and may assume that the person
purporting to give receipt or advice or make any statement or execute any
document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to
do so. Escrow Agent may conclusively presume that the undersigned
representative of any party hereto which is an entity other than a natural
person has full power and authority to instruct Escrow Agent on behalf of
that party unless written notice to the contrary is delivered to Escrow Agent.

  



  

(d) Escrow Agent may act pursuant to the advice of counsel with
respect to any matter relating to this Agreement and shall not be liable
for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith in accordance with such
advice.

  



  

(e) Escrow Agent does not have any interest in the Escrow Fund
deposited hereunder but is serving as escrow holder only and has only
possession thereof. Any payments of income from the Escrow Fund shall be
subject to withholding regulations then in force with respect to United
States taxes. The parties hereto will provide Escrow Agent with appropriate
Internal Revenue Service Forms W-9 for tax identification number
certification, or nonresident alien certifications. This Section 5(e) and
Section 5(b) shall survive notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement
or the resignation of Escrow Agent.

  



  

(f) Escrow Agent makes no representation as to the validity, value,
genuineness or collectability of any security or other document or
instrument held by or delivered to it.

  



  

(g) Escrow Agent shall not be called upon to advise any party as to
the wisdom in selling or retaining or taking or refraining from any
action with respect to any securities or other property deposited hereunder.

  



  

(h) Escrow Agent (and any successor Escrow Agent) may at any time
resign as such by delivering the Escrow Fund to any successor Escrow
Agent jointly designated by the other parties hereto in writing, or to any
court of competent jurisdiction, whereupon Escrow Agent shall be discharged
of and from any and all further obligations arising in connection with this
Agreement. The resignation of Escrow Agent will take effect on the earlier of
(i) the appointment of a successor (including a court of competent
jurisdiction) or (ii) the day which is thirty (30) days after the date of
delivery of its written notice of resignation to the other parties
hereto. If, at that time, Escrow Agent has not received a designation of a
successor Escrow Agent, Escrow Agent\'s sole responsibility after that time
shall be to retain and safeguard the Escrow Fund until receipt of a
designation of successor Escrow Agent or a joint written disposition
instruction by the other parties hereto or a final, nonappealable order of a
court of competent jurisdiction.

(i) In the event of any disagreement between the other parties
hereto resulting in adverse claims or demands being made in connection with
the Escrow Fund or in the event that Escrow Agent is in doubt as to what
action it should take hereunder, Escrow Agent shall be entitled to retain the
Escrow Fund until Escrow Agent shall have received (i) a final, nonappealable
order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing delivery of the Escrow
Fund or (ii) a written agreement executed by the other parties hereto
directing delivery of the Escrow Fund, in which event Escrow Agent shall
disburse the Escrow Fund in accordance with such order or agreement.
Any court order shall be accompanied by a legal opinion by counsel for the
presenting party satisfactory to Escrow Agent to the effect that the order is
final and nonappealable. Escrow Agent shall act on such court order and legal
opinion without further question.

  



  

(j) Purchaser and Seller agree to pay and reimburse Escrow Agent for
all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made
by Escrow Agent in performance of its duties hereunder (including reasonable
fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel). Any such payment and
reimbursement to which Escrow Agent is entitled shall be borne fifty percent
(50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser. Any fees, expenses,
disbursements and advances of Escrow Agent or its counsel that are not paid as
provided for herein may be taken from any property held by Escrow Agent
hereunder.

  



  

(k) No printed or other matter in any language (including, without
limitation, prospectuses, notices, reports and promotional material) that
mentions Escrow Agent\'s name or the rights, powers or duties of Escrow Agent
shall be issued by the other parties hereto or on such parties\' behalf
unless Escrow Agent shall first have given its specific written consent
thereto.

  



  

(l) The other parties hereto authorize Escrow Agent, for any
securities held hereunder, to use the services of any United States
central securities depository it reasonably deems appropriate, including,
without limitation, the Depository Trust Company and the Federal Reserve Book
Entry System.

This Agreement expressly sets forth all the duties of Escrow Agent with
respect to any and all matters pertinent hereto. No implied duties or
obligations shall be read into this Agreement against Escrow Agent. Escrow
Agent shall not be bound by the provisions of any agreement among the other
parties hereto except this Agreement.

7. _Ownership for Tax Purposes_.

  



  

Seller agrees that, for purposes of federal and other taxes based on income,
Seller will be treated as the owner of the Escrow Fund and that Seller will
report all income, if any, that is earned on, or derived from, the Escrow Fund
as its income in the taxable year or years in which such income is properly
includible and pay any taxes attributable thereto.

  



  

8. _Acknowledgement_.

  



  

Seller acknowledges and agrees that Gunster, Yoakley and Stewart, P.A. serves
as legal counsel to Purchaser and/or its Affiliates from time to time and
that nothing contained herein or any performance by the Escrow Agent or any
party hereunder shall impair or affect Gunster, Yoakley and Stewart, P.A.'s
ability and full right and authority to represent Purchaser and/or its
Affiliates in connection with any matter (including, without limitation, any
interpleader action instituted by it as Escrow Agent arising from this
Agreement), whether or not related to the subject matter hereof, nor shall
the Escrow Agent's agreement to act as escrow agent hereunder create any
impropriety or conflict of interest (or any appearance thereof) in connection
with the Escrow Agent's representation of Purchaser and/or its Affiliates. By
signing below, Purchaser, Seller and Escrow Agent acknowledge that they have
read this Agreement and agree to the terms contained herein and, for the
purposes of avoidance of any doubt, Seller hereby expressly waives any claim
of conflict of interest against Gunster, Yoakley and Stewart, P.A. arising from
its status as Escrow Agent hereunder and as counsel to the Purchaser.
