compromise, settle or offer to settle any such demands, or approve any
withdrawal of any such demand.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (A) to the
extent that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Company makes any
payment or payments in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the value
of the Adjusted Consideration that otherwise would have been payable in
respect of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with this Agreement or (B)
if Parent or the Surviving Corporation incur any Damages (including
reasonable attorneys and consultants fees, costs and expenses and including

21  reasonably detailed calculation of the amount and the elements thereof and
each Company Stockholders and Qualifying Stock Purchase Right Holders Common
Stock Equivalent Percentage, and (b) provide Parent reasonable access to any
reasonable supporting documentation for such calculations. No fewer than three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a
draft of the Closing Consideration Statement setting forth the Companys
reasonable determination of the Estimated Adjusted Consideration. The
Estimated Adjusted Consideration as determined under this _Section 2.10_
shall constitute the Adjusted Consideration for purposes of any payment to be
made hereunder as of the Closing Date.

Section 2.11 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to
Stockholders Agent a statement (the "Post-Closing Statement"), in
substantially the same form as the Closing Consideration Statement, setting
forth Parents good faith determination of the Adjusted Consideration (and all
components thereof) as of immediately prior to the Closing (the "Final
Adjusted Consideration"). Upon reasonable request of Stockholders Agent or
its representatives, Parent shall provide to Stockholders Agent and
Stockholders Agents representatives copies of any work papers, schedules,
calculations and other supporting documentation (including copies of any
primary source documents) associated with the calculation of the amounts set
forth on the Post-Closing Statement so requested, subject, in each case, to
Parents reasonable confidentiality requirements and customary access and
indemnification requirements of Parents accountants.

 

(b) Within 30 days after Stockholders Agents receipt of the Post-Closing
Statement, Stockholders Agent shall notify Parent of Stockholders Agents
agreement or disagreement with the Post-Closing Statement in writing, which
writing shall set forth in reasonable detail the items and amounts to which
Stockholders Agent objects. If Stockholders Agent disagrees with the Post-
Closing Statement, then Stockholders Agent and Parent shall work together to
reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts set forth in Stockholders
Agents notice of disagreement (the "Disputed Consideration Components") in
order to determine the Final Adjusted Consideration. If Stockholders Agent
and Parent are unable to resolve such differences within 30 days (or such
longer period as Stockholders Agent and Parent may mutually agree), they
will promptly thereafter cause independent members of the dispute resolution
group of an independent accounting firm of recognized national standing to be
mutually agreed upon by Stockholders Agent and Parent, acting reasonably and
in good faith, or if Stockholders Agent and Parent are unable to agree as to
such independent accounting firm within 15 days after the conclusion of such
30-day period, either Stockholders Agent or Parent may request that the
American Arbitration Association appoint an independent third party accounting
firm meeting the aforementioned requirements (in either case, the "Independent
Accounting Firm") to review this Agreement and the Disputed Consideration
Components for the purpose of calculating the Final Adjusted Consideration.
The Independent Accounting Firm will determine procedures for the resolution
of the dispute, subject to the terms hereof. In making its calculation of
the Final Adjusted Consideration, the Independent Accounting Firm may
consider only the Disputed Consideration Components. The Independent
Accounting Firms determination of any Disputed Consideration Components and
its calculation of the Final Adjusted Consideration must be within the range
of the amount thereof shown in the Post-Closing Statement and the amount
thereof shown in Stockholders Agents notice of disagreement. The Independent
Accounting Firm will deliver to Stockholders Agent and Parent, as promptly
as practicable, but in any event within 60 days after its appointment, a
report setting forth, in reasonable detail, its determination of the Final
Adjusted Consideration. Such report will be final and binding upon all of the
parties hereto absent manifest error. The cost of the Independent Accounting
Firms review and report will be borne by Stockholders Agent and Purchaser in
the same proportion that the dollar amount of the Disputed Consideration
Components that are not resolved in favor of Stockholders Agent or Parent (as
applicable), bears to the total dollar amount of the Disputed

 



22  Consideration Components resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm. Each
of Stockholders Agent and Parent will bear all of its other expenses incurred
in connection with matters contemplated by this _Section 2.11(b)_.

(c) Upon final determination, whether by agreement of Stockholders Agent
and Parent or pursuant to a decision of the Independent Accounting Firm
pursuant to _Section 2.11(b)_, of the Final Adjusted Consideration, the
Adjusted Consideration paid to the Company Stockholders and the Qualifying
Stock Purchase Right Holders shall be adjusted as follows: (i) if the Final
Adjusted Consideration is greater than the Estimated Adjusted Consideration,
then the Adjusted Consideration shall be increased by the amount of the
difference; (ii) if the Final Adjusted Consideration is less than the
Estimated Adjusted Consideration, then the Adjusted Consideration shall be
decreased by the amount of the difference; or (iii) if the Final Adjusted
Consideration is equal to the Estimated Adjusted Consideration, then the
Adjusted Consideration shall not be changed.

(d) If the net adjustment to the Adjusted Consideration made pursuant to
_Section 2.11(c)_ results in an increase in the Adjusted Consideration, then
Parent shall pay the amount of such increase to the Paying Agent within five
Business Days after the date on which the Final Adjusted Consideration
is determined, for further distribution to the Company Stockholders and
Qualifying Stock Purchase Right Holders in accordance with their Common Stock
Equivalent Percentages. If the net adjustment to the Adjusted Consideration
made pursuant to  _Section 2.11(c)_ results in a decrease in the Adjusted
Consideration, then Parent shall have the right to require the Escrow Agent to
disburse to Parent the amount of any shortfall pursuant to _Section
2.11(c)(ii)_ from the Indemnification Escrow Amount in accordance with the
terms of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, if the amount of any Company Transaction
Expenses included in the Final Adjusted Consideration is greater than the
amount of any Company Transaction Expenses included in the Estimated Adjusted
Consideration, as applicable, then the Stockholders Agent (acting on behalf
and for the benefit of the Company Stockholders and the Qualifying Stock
Purchase Right Holders) shall pay from the Stockholders Agent Fund the amount
of such excess to Parent within five Business Days after the date on which the
Final Adjusted Consideration is determined and, following receipt thereof,
such payment shall reduce the amount that the Escrow Agent shall be required
to disburse to Parent pursuant to the foregoing provision.

 

Section 2.12 _Paying Agent_. Before the Closing Date, Parent, the Company, the
Stockholders Agent and the Paying Agent shall enter into an agreement (the
"Paying Agent Agreement") for the Paying Agent to act as paying agent in
connection with the Merger. Before or concurrently with the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent the Adjusted
Consideration _plus_ the following to the extent they were part of calculating
the Adjusted Consideration (i) the amount of any Company Transaction Expenses,
(ii) the amount required at the Closing to discharge in full the Company
Indebtedness, (iii) the amount of any Change of Control Obligations and (iv)
any Accrued Taxes (to the extent not included in the Net Working Capital) (the
"Payment Fund"). The Payment Fund shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of the Paying Agent Agreement and shall not be used for any other
purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent pursuant to
the applicable provisions of the Paying Agent Agreement. The Surviving
Corporation or Parent shall bear and pay all charges and expenses of the
Paying Agent (and, for the avoidance of doubt, not from the Payment Fund).

 

Section 2.13 _Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Procedures_. In order to receive its, his, or her portion of the
Adjusted Consideration in accordance with this _Article II_ , each Company
Stockholder must surrender to the Paying Agent the Company Certificate(s)
representing such Company Stockholders ownership of

 



23  Company Capital Stock, together with a duly completed and validly executed
letter of transmittal in substantially the form of _Exhibit E_ attached
hereto (each, a "Transmittal Letter"). After the Effective Time, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the receipt of a Company Stockholders
Transmittal Letter and Company Certificates, the Paying Agent shall, in
exchange therefor, deliver to such Company Stockholder his, her or its
portion of the Adjusted Consideration in accordance with this _Article II_.
Until properly surrendered, each outstanding Company Certificate will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to
evidence the right to receive a portion of the Adjusted Consideration in
accordance with, subject to the other terms and conditions of, this _Article
II_.

 

(b) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
2.13_, neither the Surviving Corporation nor any Party shall be liable to any
Person for any amount properly paid to a Governmental Entity pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(c) _Dissenting Shares_. The provisions of this _Section 2.13_ shall also
apply to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except that the
obligations of Parent under this _Section 2.13_ shall commence on the date of
loss of such status and the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange for such shares the portion of the Adjusted Consideration to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_ , subject to such
holders compliance with this _Section 2.13_ and the other terms hereof.

 

Section 2.14 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of any shares
of Company Capital Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Company Certificates evidencing ownership of

in any applicable Inbound License or (ii) Permitted Liens. The Company IP is
valid, subsisting and enforceable, and there are, to the Companys Knowledge,
no facts, circumstances or information that would or reasonably could
be expected to render any Company IP invalid or unenforceable. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement and other Transaction Documents and the
consummation of the

 



32  Merger and the Other Transactions will not (A) result in the loss or
impairment of any Company IP, including the use, practice and exploitation of
any Company IP in the same manner in which it is currently being used,
practiced or otherwise exploited by the Company or the Subsidiary, as
applicable, or (B) give rise to any right of any Person to terminate any
rights under any Inbound License or exercise any new or additional
rights under any Company IP.

(c) None of the Company, the Subsidiary, the Products (including the
manufacture and use thereof), the Company IP or the conduct of the Companys
or the Subsidiarys business in the manner in which it is currently being
conducted interferes with, infringes, misappropriates or violates any
Intellectual Property Rights of any Person (and have not previously done so).
Neither the Company nor the Subsidiary has received any written or, to the
Companys Knowledge, oral charge, complaint, claim, demand or notice alleging
any such interference, infringement, misappropriation or violation (including
any written or, to the Companys Knowledge, oral notice that the Company or
the Subsidiary must license or refrain from using any Intellectual Property of
any other Person or any offer by any other Person to license any
Intellectual Property to the Company or the Subsidiary), and, to the
Companys Knowledge, there is no basis therefor. To the Companys Knowledge,
no Person has interfered with, infringed upon, misappropriated or violated or
is currently interfering with, infringing upon, misappropriating or violating
any Company IP.

(d) _Section 3.10(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedule identifies: (i) each item
of Registered IP (and for each such item, the full legal name of the
owner/applicant of record, the jurisdiction in which it exists, the
application or registration number, and the date of application, registration
or issuance, as applicable, and all upcoming due dates and filing deadlines
up to and including the date that is 12 months after the date hereof); and
(ii) all domain names owned or used by the Company or the Subsidiary (and for
each such domain name, the full legal name of the owner and registrar of
record). The Company has delivered to Parent true, complete and correct copies
of all documents and correspondence pertaining to each item of Registered IP.
All Registered IP (A) is in full force and effect, (B) is valid, subsisting
and enforceable, (C) has not been abandoned, passed into the public domain or
permitted to lapse and (D) has been obtained and maintained in compliance with
all Laws.

 

(e) _Section 3.10(e)_ of the Disclosure Schedule identifies each (i) Inbound
License (excluding commercially available, off-the-shelf licenses for
Software with an acquisition cost of less than $5,000, other than licenses for
Open Source Materials) and (ii) Outbound License. The Company has delivered to
Parent true, complete and correct copies of all IP Licenses (excluding
commercially available, off-the-shelf licenses for Software with an
acquisition cost of less than $5,000, other than licenses for Open Source
Materials). All IP Licenses are, to the Companys Knowledge, valid, binding
and enforceable against all parties thereto, and there is no outstanding or
threatened dispute or disagreement with respect to any IP License. There
exists no event or condition that does or will result in a material violation
or material breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of
time or both) a material default under, any IP License by the Company, the
Subsidiary, or, to the Companys Knowledge, any other party thereto.

 

(f) _Section 3.10(f)_ of the Disclosure Schedule lists all Software owned by
the Company or the Subsidiary and currently used in the Companys or the
Subsidiarys business. No source code for any Software that is owned by the
Company or the Subsidiary or exclusively licensed to the Company or the
Subsidiary has been delivered, licensed, or is subject to any source code
escrow, delivery or similar obligation, whether contingent or otherwise, of
the Company or the Subsidiary to any third party. Except as set forth on
_Section 3.10(f)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, the source code for all
Software owned by the Company or the Subsidiary contains annotations, and
otherwise has been documented in a professional manner that is both (i)
consistent with customary code annotation conventions and best practices in
the software industry and (ii) sufficient to independently enable a

 



33  programmer of reasonable skill and competence to understand, analyze and
interpret program logic, correct errors and improve, enhance, modify and
support such Software. Except as set forth on  _Section 3.10(f)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, no Open Source Materials are contained in, distributed
with or used in the manufacturing, testing, assembly, operation, support,
development or compilation of, any Products.

 

(g) _Section 3.10(g)_ of the Disclosure Schedule identifies any Company IP
material to the conduct of the Companys and the Subsidiarys business that
is not otherwise identified in _Section 3.10(d)_, _(e)_ or _(f)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule.

 

(h) _Section 3.10(h)_ of the Disclosure Schedule identifies each standards-
setting organization, university or industry body, consortium, other multi-
party special interest group and any other collaborative or other group in
which the Company, the Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates has
participated in the past, is currently participating, or has applied
for future participation in, including any of the foregoing that may be
organized, funded, sponsored, formed or operated, in whole or in part, by any
Governmental Entity, in all cases, to the extent related to the Company IP,
and a listing and description of the membership agreements and other
Contracts, bylaws, policies, rules and similar materials relating to such
organizations, bodies and other groups, to which the Company, the Subsidiary
or any of their respective Affiliates is, was or has agreed to be bound,
true, complete and correct copies of which have been delivered to Parent. None
of the Company, the Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates is, bound
by, or has agreed to be bound by, any Contract, bylaw, policy, or rule of any
Person that requires or purports to require the Company, the Subsidiary or
such Affiliate (or, following the Closing Date, Parent or any of its
Affiliates) to contribute, disclose or license any Intellectual Property to
such Person or its other members.

(i) Each current and former employee, officer, director, manager, consultant
and contractor of the Company or the Subsidiary who is or has been involved
in the development (alone or with others) of any Intellectual Property by or
for the Company or the Subsidiary, or has or previously had access to any
Trade Secrets, including Software source code, has executed a written, valid
and enforceable Contract that (i) irrevocably and presently assigns to the
Company or the Subsidiary, as applicable, without an obligation of additional
payment, sole ownership of and all right, title and interest in and to
any such Intellectual Property and (ii) reasonably protects such Trade
Secrets. Each such individual has executed a Contract in substantially the
form as made available to Parent. Neither the Company nor the Subsidiary owes
any compensation or remuneration to any current or former employee, officer,
director, consultant or contractor in relation to any Company IP. There is no
Company IP that is owned, licensed to or otherwise held by a current or former
employee, officer, director, equity holder, manager, consultant or contractor
of the Company or the Subsidiary.

(j) In each case in which the Company or the Subsidiary has acquired
ownership (or claimed or purported to acquire ownership) of any Owned IP from
any Person (including any employee, officer, director, equity holder, manager,
consultant or contractor of the Company or the Subsidiary), the Company or
the Subsidiary, as applicable, has obtained a valid and enforceable
assignment sufficient to irrevocably and presently assign sole ownership of
and all rights with respect to such Owned IP to the Company or the Subsidiary,
as applicable. All assignments of such Owned IP that are or may be required
to be filed or recorded for such assignment to be valid or effective against
bona fide purchasers without notice of such assignment have been duly executed
and filed or recorded with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or the U.S.
Copyright Office, as applicable, and any other applicable Governmental Entity.
True, complete and correct copies of such assignments have been delivered to
Parent.

 

(k) All Patents that are owned by the Company and the Subsidiary (each, a
"Company Patent") are in material compliance with all legal requirements,
including payment of correct

 



34  filing, examination and maintenance fees and proofs of working or use. To
the Companys Knowledge, no Company Patent or Patent that is exclusively
licensed to the Company or the Subsidiary (the "Owned and Exclusive Patents")
has been or is now involved in any interference, reissue, reexamination,
opposition, post-grant review, derivation, or similar Proceeding in the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office or before any other Governmental Entity, and no
such action has been threatened. Neither the Company nor the Subsidiary
controls any Patents that are not included in the Company Patents. The Company
or the Subsidiary, as applicable, has the sole, unrestricted right to sue for
past, present and future infringement of the Company Patents and to recover
damages, costs and other remedies with respect thereto. Other than the
Outbound Licenses identified in _Section 3.10(e)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, there are no existing Contracts, proposals, bids, offers
or rights with, to or in any Person to acquire any right, title or interest in
or to the Company Patents or related Company Patent rights, whether implied or
express, written or oral. No right, authorization, license, covenant,
immunity, release, standstill or waiver has been granted or retained under the
Company Patents or related patent rights (whether by the Company, the
Subsidiary, any prior owner or any other Person), whether implied or express,
written or oral, and there is no obligation imposed by or commitment made to a
standards body, standard-setting organization or standards development
organization to license or grant any rights to any of the Company Patents.
None of the Outbound Licenses or other rights is exclusive or transferable,
includes the right to grant sublicenses or is subject to any compulsory
license. Parent will not be or become subject to any covenant not to sue,
release or similar limitation on its enforcement or enjoyment of the Company
Patents as a result of any action taken or not taken by the Company, the
Subsidiary or, to the Companys Knowledge, any prior owner of any Owned and
Exclusive Patents. None of the Company, the Subsidiary or, to the Companys
Knowledge, any prior owner of any Company Patent has engaged in any conduct,
or omitted to perform any necessary act, the result of which would invalidate
any of the Company Patents or hinder their enforcement, including
misrepresenting the Companys or the Subsidiarys patent rights to a standard-
setting organization or failing to disclose material prior art in connection
with the prosecution of any Company Patent. To the Companys Knowledge, there
are no Patents that claim priority over or otherwise relate to the subject
matter of the Owned and Exclusive Patents that have been abandoned or
withdrawn by the Company, the Subsidiary or any prior owner thereof. If any
Company Patent is subject to a terminal disclaimer under 37 C.F.R. § 1.321,
then all Patents subject to the terminal disclaimer are included in the
Company Patents.

 

(l) Any mask works that are included in the Company IP were (i) developed
solely by employees of the Company or the Subsidiary acting within the scope
of their employment who irrevocably and presently assigned any Intellectual
Property rights that they may have in or to such mask works to the Company or
the Subsidiary pursuant to valid and enforceable written Contracts, or (ii)
developed by independent contractors who irrevocably and presently assigned
any Intellectual Property rights that they may have in or to such mask works
to the Company or the Subsidiary pursuant to valid and enforceable written
Contracts. No such mask works contain any design, documentation or other
Intellectual Property that is owned (or claimed to be owned) by any Person
other than the Company or the Subsidiary. True, complete and correct copies of
documents relating to such mask works have been delivered to Parent.

(m) (i) The Company and the Subsidiary have taken all commercially reasonable
measures in accordance with Law and industry practices (but in any event not
less than reasonable measures) to protect and preserve their rights in the
Company IP and to safeguard and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of
all of their Trade Secrets; (ii) the Company and the Subsidiary have only
disclosed Trade Secrets pursuant to the terms of a valid and enforceable
Contract that requires the Person receiving such Trade Secrets to reasonably
protect and not disclose such Trade Secrets; and (iii) there has been no
disclosure by the Company, the Subsidiary or, to the Companys Knowledge, any
of their respective equity holders, employees, officers, directors, managers,
consultants or contractors of any Trade Secrets that would compromise the
confidentiality of such Trade Secrets or their status or

 



35  protectability under Law. To the Companys Knowledge, there has been no
misappropriation of any Trade Secrets by any Person or any material breach of
any obligation of confidentiality owed to the Company or the Subsidiary with
respect to any Trade Secrets. The Company and the Subsidiary are in material
compliance with all Contracts relating to third party Trade Secrets to which
the Company or the Subsidiary is a party or that otherwise bind the Company
or the Subsidiary.

(n) The Company and the Subsidiary have, since December 31, 2011, (i)
complied with all Laws relating to data privacy, data protection and data
security, including with respect to the collection, storage, transmission,
transfer (including cross-border transfers), disclosure, destruction and use
of Personally Identifiable Information, and (ii) taken commercially
reasonable measures consistent with industry practices (but in any event not
less than reasonable measures) to ensure that all data and information owned
or held by the Company or the Subsidiary (including any Personally
Identifiable Information) (collectively, "Company Data") is protected against
loss, damage and unauthorized access, use, modification or other misuse. To
the Companys Knowledge, there has been no loss, damage or unauthorized
access, use, modification or other misuse of any Company Data. No Person has
provided any notice, made any claim or commenced any Proceeding with respect
to loss, damage or unauthorized access, use, modification or other misuse of
any Company Data and, to the Companys Knowledge, there is no reasonable basis
for any such Proceeding.

(o) To the Companys Knowledge, all Software used by the Company or the
Subsidiary is substantially free of any material defects, bugs and errors,
and, to the Companys Knowledge, does not contain or make available any
disabling software, code or instructions, spyware, Trojan horses, worms,
viruses or other software routines that permit or cause unauthorized access
to, or disruption, impairment, disablement or destruction of, Software, data
or other materials ("Contaminants").

(p) The computer, information technology and data processing systems,
facilities and services used by the Company or the Subsidiary, including all
Software, hardware, networks, communications facilities, platforms and related
systems and services used or planned to be used by the Company or the
Subsidiary (collectively, the "Systems"), are sufficient for the current
business of the Company or the Subsidiary, as applicable, as presently
conducted. The Systems are in working condition to perform all computing,
information technology and data processing operations necessary for the
operation of the Companys and the Subsidiarys business in the manner in
which it is currently being conducted, and there are no current plans or
Contracts for any material modifications, upgrades or replacements to the
Systems. The Company and the Subsidiary have each taken all commercially
reasonable steps and implemented commercially reasonable safeguards to ensure
that the Systems are substantially free from Contaminants. There has been
no material failure, breakdown or substandard performance of any Systems
during the 12 months immediately preceding the date hereof that has caused a
material disruption or interruption in or to any use of the Systems or the
operation of the Companys or the Subsidiarys business. Each of the Company
and the Subsidiary makes back-up copies of data and information critical to
the conduct of its business at least once every day and conducts periodic
tests (no less frequent than annually) to ensure the effectiveness of such
back-up systems.

(q) There is no Contract, Order or other provision or requirement
that obligates the Company or the Subsidiary to grant any license, covenant
not to sue, immunity, release or right in the future with respect to any
Company IP. Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document by the Company, nor the consummation of the
Merger or the Other Transactions, with or without notice or lapse of time,
will result in or give any other Person the right or option to cause or
declare (i) a loss or impairment of, Lien on, the release, disclosure, or
delivery to any other Person of, or the grant, assignment or transfer to any
other Person of any title to or any license or other right or interest under,
to or in any Company IP (including any source code to any 

 



36  Software owned, licensed, or leased by, or otherwise used in the business
of, the Company or the Subsidiary) or any Intellectual Property owned or held
by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, from and after the Closing,
the Company and the Subsidiary); (ii) a breach or modification of or default
under any IP License; (iii) Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, from
and after the Closing, the Company and the Subsidiary) to be (A) bound by any
non-compete obligation or other restriction on the operation of any business
by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, from and after the Closing, the
Company and the Subsidiary) or (B) obligated to pay any incremental royalties
or other amounts, offer any incremental or other discounts, or be bound by any
incremental or other "most favored pricing" terms to any other Person. As used
in this _Section 3.10(q)_, an "incremental" royalty, amount, discount or
"most favored pricing" term refers to a royalty, amount, discount or "most
favored pricing" term, as applicable, in excess, whether by contractual term,
contractual rate or scope, of those obligations that would have been required
to be offered or granted, as applicable, had this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document or the Merger or the Other Transactions not been executed
or consummated, as applicable. Each item of Company IP owned or exploited by
the Company or the Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing will be owned
or available for exploitation by the Company or the Subsidiary, as applicable,
on identical terms and conditions immediately after the Closing.

Section 3.11 _Products_. Each of the Products manufactured, distributed,
licensed, sold, or leased by or on behalf of the Company or the Subsidiary
since December 31, 2011 is identified in _Section 3.11_ of the Disclosure
Schedule. All Products and all Services have, since December 31, 2011,
conformed in all material respects with all applicable contractual
commitments and all express and implied warranties issued by the Company or
the Subsidiary, the Companys or the Subsidiarys, as applicable, published
product specifications and with all certification standards, Laws, and other
requirements of any Person to which they are required to conform. All Products
were free of any defects when sold, and neither the Company nor the Subsidiary
has any Liability for replacement or modification of any such Products
or other damages in connection therewith, other than in the Ordinary Course
of Business in an aggregate amount not exceeding the warranty reserve stated
on the most recent Annual Balance Sheet. There are no defects in the design or
technology (including any Company Process Technology) embodied in any
Products that impair or are reasonably likely to impair the intended use of
the Products. There are no pending, or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened
Proceedings relating to any alleged hazard or alleged defect in design,
manufacture, materials or workmanship, including any failure to warn or
alleged breach of express or implied warranty or representation, relating to
any Product, and, to the Companys Knowledge, there is no basis for any such
Proceeding. _Section 3.11_ of the Disclosure Schedule lists all current (as
of the date hereof) standard product warranties, indemnifications, and
guarantees that the Company or the Subsidiary provides to its customers.
Except as disclosed on _Section 3.11_ of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the
Company nor the Subsidiary has extended to any of its customers any non-
uniform product warranties, indemnifications or guarantees. No purchaser
of any of the Products or Services has any refund, return or credit rights
with respect to such Products or Services, except as expressly provided for in
the Companys or the Subsidiarys, as applicable, standard contractual
warranties provided for the benefit of purchasers of such Products or
Services, true, complete and correct copies of which have been provided to
Parent.

 

Section 3.12 _Environmental Matters_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.12_
of the Disclosure Schedule:

 

(a) The Company, the Subsidiary and, to the Companys Knowledge, each of their
respective predecessors and Affiliates have complied and are in compliance in
all material respects with all Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements.
None of the Company, the Subsidiary, or, to the Companys Knowledge, any of
any of their respective predecessors or Affiliates has received any notice,
report or other information regarding any actual or alleged violation or
breach of any Environmental, Health and Safety Requirement or any
investigatory, remedial or corrective Liabilities.

 



37  The Company has furnished to Parent all environmental audits, reports and
other environmental documents in its possession or under its reasonable
control relating to the Companys or the Subsidiarys past and current
properties, facilities and operations.

(b) None of the following exists at any property or facility owned or
operated by the Company or the Subsidiary: (i) underground storage tanks; (ii)
asbestos-containing material in any form or condition; (iii) materials or
equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls; or (iv) landfills, surface
impoundments or disposal areas. None of the Company, the Subsidiary or, to the
Companys Knowledge, any of their respective predecessors or Affiliates has
treated, stored, disposed of, arranged for or permitted the disposal
of, transported, handled, manufactured, distributed or released any
substance, including any hazardous substance, or owned or operated any
property or facility (and no such property or facility is contaminated by any
such substance) so as to give rise to any current or future Liabilities,
including any Liability for fines, penalties, investigative costs, response
costs, cleanup costs, corrective action costs, personal injury, property
damage, natural resources damages or attorneys fees pursuant to any
Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements. None of the Company, the
Subsidiary or, to the Companys Knowledge, any of their respective
predecessors has assumed, undertaken or otherwise become subject to any
Liability, including any obligation for corrective or remedial action, of any
other Person relating to Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements.

 

(c) Neither this Agreement nor any other Transaction Document, nor the
consummation of the Merger or the Other Transactions, would reasonably be
expected to result in any obligation for site investigation or cleanup, or
notification to or consent of any Governmental Entity or third parties,
pursuant to any of the so-called "transaction-triggered" or "responsible
property transfer" Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements.

Section 3.13 _Taxes_.

 

(a) Except as disclosed in _Section 3.13(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, the
Company and the Subsidiary have timely filed all federal, state, local and
foreign income, information and other Tax Returns that were required to be
filed by either one of them on or prior to the Closing Date. All such Tax
Returns were prepared in compliance with all Laws in all material respects.
No issues have been raised by (that have not been resolved) or are currently
pending with any Governmental Entity with respect to any such Tax. No
extension of time to file any such Tax Return has been requested from or
granted by any Governmental Entity for which the Tax Return has not been
filed.

(b) The Company and the Subsidiary have timely paid all Taxes imposed upon
the Company or the Subsidiary, as applicable, or for which the Company or the
Subsidiary, as applicable, is or could be liable, whether to Governmental
Entities or other Persons (such as, for example, under Tax allocation
agreements), with respect to all taxable periods or portions of periods
ending on or before the Closing Date, other than Taxes that are not yet due
and payable and Taxes that are being contested in good faith by the Company or
the Subsidiary. The unpaid Taxes of the Company and the Subsidiary that are
not yet due and payable do not exceed the reserve for Tax Liability (excluding
any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) set forth or included in the Interim Financial
Statements, as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date, in
accordance with the past practices of the Company and the Subsidiary. The
amount of unpaid Taxes that are being contested in good faith by the Company
or the Subsidiary, the Governmental Entity with whom these Taxes are being
contested and the status of these proceedings are set forth on _Section
3.13(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

 

(c) Except as disclosed in _Section 3.13(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule,
since December 31, 2009, neither the Company nor the Subsidiary has been the
subject of any audit or

 



38  investigation by any Governmental Entity with respect to any Tax for any
taxable periods or portions of periods ending on or before the Closing Date.
Except as disclosed in  _Section 3.13(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, to the
Companys Knowledge, there are no facts that are reasonably likely to cause or
result in any material dispute with, or any audit or inspection by, any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company
or the Subsidiary. No waivers of statutes of limitation with respect to the
Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or the Subsidiary have been given by or
requested from the Company or the Subsidiary, as applicable, that have not
since expired. No claim has ever been made by any Governmental Entity in a
jurisdiction where the Company does not file Tax Returns that the Company is
or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction, and except as provided on
_Section 3.13(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule the Company is not subject to
taxation in any jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which the Company
has been incorporated. No claim has ever been made by any Governmental Entity
in a jurisdiction where the Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that the
Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction and except as
provided on _Section 3.13(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule the Subsidiary is
not subject to taxation in any jurisdiction other than Hong Kong.

(d) Reserved

 

(e) All deficiencies asserted or assessments made as a result of any
examinations of Tax Returns previously filed by the Company or the Subsidiary
have been fully paid, are fully reflected as a Liability in the Interim
Financial Statements or are being contested and an adequate reserve therefor
has been established and is fully reflected as a Liability in the Interim
Financial Statements.

(f) All material elections with respect to Taxes affecting the Company or the
Subsidiary are reflected in the Companys Tax Returns.

(g) All Taxes required to be withheld by or on behalf of the Company or the
Subsidiary in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee,
independent contractor, consultant, creditor or other Person have been
properly withheld, and all such Taxes either have been duly and timely paid to
the proper Governmental Entities or, in circumstances where such Taxes
have not yet become due and payable, the Company and the Subsidiary have each
maintained complete, correct and up-to-date records that comply with all
applicable Tax Laws in all material respects with respect to such
withholdings.

 

(h) Neither Company nor the Subsidiary is required to include any amount into
income as a result of (i) a "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121
of the Code or other agreement with a Governmental Entity (or any similar
provision of any Law) executed on or before the Closing Date, (ii) an
intercompany transaction or excess loss account described in Treasury
Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or any similar provision of any
Law), (iii) an installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or
before the Closing Date, or (iv) a prepaid amount received on or before the
Closing Date.

(i) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent true, complete and
correct copies of each of the following: (i) all audit reports, letter
rulings, technical advice memoranda and similar documents issued by a
Governmental Entity relating to the United States or foreign Taxes due from or
with respect to the Company or the Subsidiary; (ii) all closing agreements
entered into by the Company or the Subsidiary with any Governmental Entity
during the last three years (or which otherwise could have any material impact
on any Tax period for which the applicable statute of limitations has
not expired) relating to Taxes and existing on the date hereof; and (iii)
copies of any correspondence during the last three years (or which relates to
any matter that could have a material impact on any Tax period for which the
applicable statute of limitations has not expired) relating to audits or
investigations for Taxes with any Governmental Entity.

 



39 (j) Except as provided in _Section 3.13(j)_ of the Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor the Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise bound by,
any Contract or plan (including any Employee Benefit Plan) that has resulted
or would result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess
parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. The
execution of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
consummation of the Merger and the Other Transactions (either alone or upon
the occurrence of any additional or subsequent event) will not result in any
"parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G of the Code).

 

(k) None of the Company, the Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate has any
obligation to provide (whether pursuant to an Employee Benefit Plan
or otherwise) a "gross-up", indemnity payment or otherwise to compensate any
individual with respect to the additional Taxes or interest imposed pursuant
to Section 280G of the Code, Section 4999 of the Code or Section 409A of the
Code.

(l) Except as provided in _Section 3.13(l)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, each
Employee Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as
defined in Code Section 409A(d)(1)) complies in all respects with Section 409A
of the Code and all applicable IRS guidance issued with respect thereto (and
has so complied for the entire period during which Section 409A of the Code
has applied to such Employee Benefit Plan). No event has occurred that would
be treated by Code Section 409A(b) as a transfer of property for purposes of
Code Section 83\. No stock option or equity unit option granted under any
Employee Benefit Plan has an exercise price that has been or may be less than
the fair market value of the underlying stock or equity units (as the case may
be) as of the date such option was granted or has any feature for the
deferral of compensation other than the deferral of recognition of income
until the later of exercise or disposition of such option. Neither the Merger
nor any Other Transaction will constitute or result in a violation of Section
409A(a)(2), 409A(a)(3) or 409A(a)(4) of the Code (or otherwise violate Section
409A of the Code).

(m) Neither the Company nor the Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any Tax
indemnity agreement, Tax sharing agreement, tax allocation agreement or any
similar Contract for the sharing of Tax Liabilities or benefits.

 

(n) Neither the Company nor the Subsidiary is subject to or required to
register for any value-added Tax.

 

(o) Neither the Company nor the Subsidiary has ever been a member of an
affiliated group of corporations within the meaning of Section 1504 of the
Code, or any similar affiliated or consolidated group for Tax purposes under
state, local or foreign Law (other than a group the common parent of which is
the Company), and neither the Company nor the Subsidiary has any Liability
for Taxes of any Person (other than the Company or the Subsidiary) under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local
or foreign Law as a transferee or successor, by Contract or otherwise.

 

(p) Neither the Company nor the Subsidiary has agreed to make, or is required
to make, any adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code by reason of a
change in accounting method or otherwise.

(q) Each of the Company and the Subsidiary has disclosed on its Tax Returns

Government Contract. No suspension or debarment actions with respect to
Government Contracts have been commenced or, to the Companys Knowledge,
threatened against the Company, the Subsidiary or any of their respective
officers or employees. To the Companys Knowledge, there is no valid basis
for the Companys or the Subsidiarys suspension or debarment from bidding on
Contracts (or subcontracts) for or with any Governmental Entity. No cure
notice or show cause notice has been issued to the Company or the Subsidiary
and remains outstanding.

(j) _Section 3.21(j)_ of the Disclosure Schedule lists all Contracts to
which the Company or the Subsidiary is a party or by which its properties or

Other Transactions.

 



51 Section 3.22 _Accounts Receivable and Payable_. Subject to any reserves
set forth in the Interim Balance Sheet, all accounts receivable of the
Company or the Subsidiary shown on the Interim Balance Sheet and all accounts
receivable of the Company or the Subsidiary arising from and after the date of
the Interim Balance Sheet to and including the Closing Date, are valid
receivables subject to no setoffs or counterclaims, represent and will
represent bona fide claims against debtors for sales and other charges, and
are not subject to discount except for normal cash and immaterial trade
discounts. The amounts carried for doubtful accounts and allowances disclosed
in the Interim Balance Sheet are sufficient to provide for any losses which
may be sustained on realization of the receivables. The amounts carried
as reserves for expenses, including all expenses for services rendered and
goods purchased, and warranty claims on the Interim Balance Sheet are
sufficient for the payment of all (a) expenses incurred prior to the Closing
Date, other than Transaction Expenses, (b) current warranty claims and (c)
warranty claims that may arise after the date here that are required to be
included in the Interim Balance Sheet in accordance with the Accounting
Principles. There are no unpaid invoices or bills representing amounts
alleged to be owed by the Company or the Subsidiary, or other alleged
obligations of the Company or the Subsidiary, which the Company or the
Subsidiary, as applicable, has disputed or determined to dispute or refuse to
pay.

Section 3.23 _Inventory_. The inventories of the Company and the Subsidiary,
whether shown on the Interim Balance Sheet or thereafter acquired by the
Company or the Subsidiary, consist of items of a quantity and quality usable
or salable in the Ordinary Course of Business. Since the date of the Interim
Balance Sheet, the Company and the Subsidiary have continued to replenish
inventories in the Ordinary Course of Business. Neither the Company nor the
Subsidiary has received written or, to the Companys Knowledge, oral notice
that it will experience in the foreseeable future any material difficulty in
obtaining, in the desired quantity and quality and at a reasonable price and
upon reasonable terms and conditions, the raw materials, supplies or component
products (including any Company Process Technology) required for
the manufacture, assembly or production of the Products. The values at which
inventories are carried reflect the inventory valuation policy of the Company
and the Subsidiary, which is in accordance with the Accounting Principles.
Since the date of the Interim Balance Sheet, due provision was made on the
books of the Company and the Subsidiary in the Ordinary Course of Business to
provide for all slow-moving, obsolete, or unusable inventories to their
estimated useful or scrap values and such inventory reserves are adequate to
provide for such slow-moving, obsolete or unusable inventory and inventory
shrinkage.

 

Section 3.24 _Propriety of Past Payments_. Since December 31, 2009, no payment
has been made by or on behalf or for the benefit of the Company or the
Subsidiary with the understanding that any part of such payment is to be used
for any purpose other than that described in the documents supporting such
payment. No unrecorded fund or asset of the Company or the Subsidiary has
been established for any purpose. No accumulation or use of corporate funds of
the Company or the Subsidiary has been made without being properly accounted
for in the books and records of the Company or the Subsidiary, as
applicable. None of the Company, the Subsidiary, any director, officer or
employee of the Company or the Subsidiary or, to the Companys Knowledge, any
agent of the Company or the Subsidiary or any other Person associated with or
acting for or on behalf of the Company or the Subsidiary has, directly or
indirectly, made any illegal contribution, gift, bribe, rebate, payoff,
influence payment, kickback or other payment to any Person, private or public,
regardless of form, whether in money, property or services, (a) to obtain
favorable treatment for the Company, the Subsidiary or any of their respective
Affiliates in securing business, (b) to pay for favorable treatment for
business secured for 

 



52  the Company, the Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates, (c) to
obtain special concessions, or for special concessions already obtained, for
or in respect of the Company, the Subsidiary or, to the Companys Knowledge,
any of their respective Affiliates or (d) otherwise for the benefit of the
Company, the Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates in violation of
any Law. Since December 31, 2009, none of the Company, the Subsidiary, any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, or any other Persons
acting for or on behalf of the Company or the Subsidiary, has on behalf or for
the benefit of the Company (i) used funds for unlawful contributions, gifts,
entertainment or other unlawful expenses related to political activity or (ii)
accepted or received any unlawful contribution, payment, gift, kickback,
expenditure or other item of value. None of the Company, the Subsidiary, any
of their respective directors, officers, or employees or, to the Companys
Knowledge, any of their respective agents or any other Persons acting on
behalf of the Company or the Subsidiary has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to an offense involving financial fraud or corruption in any
jurisdiction or is listed by any Governmental Entity as debarred, suspended,
proposed for suspension or disbarment or otherwise ineligible for government
procurement programs.

 

Section 3.25 _Company Information Statement_. None of the information
supplied, or to be supplied, by or on behalf of the Company included in the
Information Statement will, at the date mailed to the Company Stockholders and
the Qualifying Stock Purchase Right Holders and as of the effective date of
the Stockholder Consent, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading when the Information Statement (including
all attachments, exhibits and amendments thereto) is read in its entirety,
including any risk factors or other disclosure contained in the Information
Statement or any amendments thereto.

 

Section 3.26 _Representations Complete; No Other Representations or
Warranties_. None of the representations or warranties made by the Company
herein or in the Disclosure Schedule or any certificate furnished by the
Company pursuant to this Agreement, when all such documents are read together
in their entirety, contains or will contain as of the date hereof or as of
the Closing Date any untrue statement of a material fact. Except for the
representations and warranties of the Company expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, neither the Company nor any
other Person makes any other express or implied representation or warranty on
behalf of the Company, the Subsidiary or with respect to the business or
assets of the Company or the Subsidiary, or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Other Transactions.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_

 

Parent and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the
Company as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date as follows:

Section 4.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Parent and Merger Sub are both
corporations duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Delaware. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own its respective properties and to carry on
its respective business as now being conducted and as currently proposed to
be conducted and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the ownership or leasing of its respective
properties or assets or the conduct of its respective businesses requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to Parent or Merger Sub.

 



53 Section 4.2 _Authority_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the
requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents and to consummate the Merger and the Other
Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and the consummation of the Merger and the Other
Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of each of Parent and Merger Sub. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and constitutes the
valid and binding obligations of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable,
enforceable against Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, in accordance with
its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by the
effect, if any, of any Enforceability Exceptions. Neither the execution and
delivery by Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Merger or the Other Transactions will conflict with, or result in any breach
or violation of, or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both) or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or obligation or
loss of any benefit under (a) any provision of the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent charter documents, as applicable,
of Parent or Merger Sub, (b) any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a
party or to by which any of Parents or Merger Subs properties or assets is
bound or (c) any Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective properties or assets, except, in the case of clauses (b) and (c)
above, any such conflicts, breaches, violations, defaults, rights or losses,
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially and
adversely delay the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the Merger or the
Other Transactions or result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
Parent or Merger Sub. Except as has already been obtained or made, no notice
to or filing with, and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any
Person is necessary for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent
and Merger Sub or the consummation of the Merger and the Other Transactions,
other than (A) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State, (B) the filing of the information required by the HSR Act in accordance
with _Section 5.3_, and (C) adoption of this Agreement by Parent as the
sole stockholder of Merger Sub.

Section 4.3 _Litigation_. There is no private or governmental Proceeding by or
pending before any Governmental Entity, or, to Parents Knowledge, threatened
against Parent or any of its subsidiaries, any of their respective properties
or any of their respective officers or directors (in their capacities as
such), which questions or challenges the validity of any Transaction
Document, the Merger or any of the Other Transactions, and there is no valid
basis for any such Proceeding that would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent or Merger Sub. There is no
Order against Parent or Merger Sub or to which Parent or Merger Sub is
subject, or to which any of their respective officers or directors (in their
capacities as such) is subject, that could prevent, enjoin, or
materially alter or delay the Merger or any of the Other Transactions.

Section 4.4 _Brokers  and Finders Fees_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has
incurred, or will incur, directly or indirectly, any Liability for brokerage
or finders fees or agents commissions or investment bankers fees or any
similar charges in connection with any Transaction Document, the Merger or
the Other Transactions for which the Company Stockholders are or may become
liable.

practicable (including entering into the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the
Paying Agent Agreement and the Retention Escrow Agreement, and the

any Governmental Entity or other Person that would impose any material
obligation on such Party) that would result in any restriction or divestiture
with respect to any assets, business or operations of such Party or its
Affiliates, or to cause its Affiliates to do or agree to do any of the
foregoing, whether prior to or following the Closing.

 

Section 5.2 _Notices and Consents_. The Company shall give all notices to
third parties and use reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents
necessary in connection with the Merger and the Other Transactions as
expeditiously as possible. No such consent shall include any condition or
qualification that would result in or constitute an adverse change in the
terms of any Material Contract, unless otherwise agreed to by Parent. Any
instrument evidencing any notice to be given or consent to be obtained prior
to the Closing shall be in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent. The Company
shall provide to Parent complete copies of all letters, applications or other
documents prior to their submission to or promptly after receipt from any
Governmental Entity or other third party with respect to each notice and
consent, and will afford Parent the reasonable opportunity to comment on any
letter, application and other document to be submitted. The Company shall

November 25, 2014, extend such date to December 4, 2014), file any and all
notices, reports and other documents required to be filed by such party under
the HSR Act with respect to the Merger and the Other Transactions (such
filings to be made on the same day) and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts promptly to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act; (ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable
provide such information as may reasonably be requested by any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger or the Other Transactions as well as any

and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken, on
a timely basis, all other actions necessary or appropriate for the purpose of
consummating and effectuating the Merger and the Other Transactions;
_provided_ that the Company or the Subsidiary, as applicable, will only be
required to take or commit to take any such action, or agree to any
such condition or restriction, if such action, commitment, agreement,
condition or restriction is binding on the Company or the Subsidiary only in
the event the Closing occurs; _provided, further_ , that, subject to the
requirements set forth in  _Section 5.3(c)_, the Company and the Subsidiary
shall only be permitted to take or commit to take any such action, or agree to
any such condition or restriction, with the prior written consent of Parent;
and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that Parent shall be solely responsible for the
payment of any filing fee of the Company under the HSR Act.

5.3_, subject to any Law, each party hereto shall (i) give the other parties
hereto prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry,
investigation, or Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Merger or the Other Transactions of which such party had
knowledge, (ii) keep

extent regarding the Merger, the Other Transactions or any such request,
inquiry, investigation, or Proceeding, and provide a copy of all written
communications. Parent and the Company shall have the right to review (and
have their respective counsel review) in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on, all material information relating
to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
subsidiaries that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the
Other Transactions and shall consider in all comments reasonably proposed by
Parent or the Company, as the case may be. In addition, each party hereto will

of the other party to have access to and be consulted in connection with any
proposed written material communication to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the Other Transactions, and (B) as
circumstances reasonably permit, consult with the other party in advance of
any meeting or conference with a Governmental Entity relating to the Merger or
the Other Transactions and give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences.

 

(c) Nothing in this _Section 5.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
require, or be construed to require, Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including Merger Sub) to (i) propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, before or after the
Effective Time, the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of any assets
or businesses of Parent, any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates, the Company
or the Subsidiary, (ii) otherwise take or commit to take any action that would
limit the freedom of action of Parent, its subsidiaries (including, following
the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiary) or Affiliates with
respect to, or would limit Parents or its Affiliates ability to retain, any
of the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or its Subsidiaries
(including, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and the
Subsidiary) in each case as may be required to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dismissal or termination of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order or other Order, or (iii) defend any lawsuit or other Proceeding
challenging any Transaction Document or the consummation of the Merger or any
Other Transaction (other than the defense against any request for preliminary
relief).

 

Section 5.4 _Operation of Business_. Without the prior written consent of
Parent, neither the Company nor the Subsidiary shall engage in any practice,
take any action or enter into any agreement or transaction outside the
Ordinary Course of Business, except for (a) making capital expenditures or
commitments, or acquiring any property, plant and equipment in accordance
with the Companys existing budget for capital expenditures, and (b) any
action expressly contemplated under this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, but subject to the foregoing exceptions, without
the prior written consent of Parent, neither the Company nor the Subsidiary

option or other securities or repurchase or cancel any of its capital stock,
other than shares of Company Capital Stock upon the exercise of any
Qualifying Stock Purchase Right, (b) incur any Indebtedness (except for
borrowings in the Ordinary Course of Business pursuant to any line of credit

and except for the use of the Companys credit cards in the Ordinary Course of

56  Business (including through the issuance of purchase orders), or which vary
from the Companys or the Subsidiarys, as applicable, normal pricing and
standard terms, (i) hire any employee or consultant or terminate the
employment of any such person except for persons who have a base compensation
of no more the $50,000 per annum, or (j) otherwise engage in any practice,
take or fail to take any action or enter into any agreement or transaction
that would cause the representations and warranties of the Company contained
herein to be untrue at any time between the date hereof and the Closing or
that would be likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
the Company or the Subsidiary.

Section 5.5 _Preservation of Business_. The Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to keep its (and cause the Subsidiary to keep its)
business, assets and properties substantially intact, including its present
operations, physical facilities, working conditions and relationships with

practices, including all accounting policies and capital expenditures, except
as provided for in this Agreement.

 

Section 5.6 _Full Access and Cooperation_. The Company will permit Parent and

manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations
of the Company or the Subsidiary, to all premises, properties, personnel,

occurrence or threatened occurrence of any event or condition which has
resulted in, or would reasonably be likely to result in, a Material Adverse
Effect with respect to the Company or the Subsidiary. No disclosure by the
Company pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall be deemed to amend or supplement
the Disclosure Schedule or to prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach
or inaccuracy of warranty or breach or nonperformance of covenant or
agreement. As soon as such information becomes available, and in any event not
more than 15 days after the end of each fiscal month, the Company shall
provide to Parent the Monthly Financial Statements for such month together
with a list of the ages and amounts of all accounts receivable and notes due

Section 6.3 _Appointment of Stockholders  Agent_.

 

(a) Without any further act of any Company Stockholder or Qualifying Stock

Holder under this Agreement and any other Transaction Document or in
connection with the Merger or any of the Other Transactions, including in

the Company Stockholders and Qualifying Stock Purchase Right Holders.

 

(c) Stockholders Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted

instruction of Stockholders Agent shall constitute a decision, act, consent,
or instruction of all of the Company Stockholders and Qualifying Stock
Purchase Right Holders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each

Parent and the Surviving Corporation may rely upon any decision, act, consent
or instruction of Stockholders Agent as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of each and every Company Stockholder and Qualifying Stock
Purchase Right Holder. Parent and the Surviving Corporation are hereby
relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, in accordance with such decision,
act, consent or instruction of Stockholders Agent.

Section 6.5 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_. Parent or, if requested by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns of the Company or the Subsidiary, as
applicable for all taxable periods to the extent such Tax Returns are filed or
required to be filed on or after the Closing Date. The cost of preparing
such Tax Returns shall be borne by Parent or if determined by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared consistently
with previous returns, to the extent not prohibited by Law. If requested by
the Stockholders Agent in writing within a reasonable period of time before
the date on which such Tax Return is required to be filed, Parent shall allow
the Stockholders Agent to review and comment on each income Tax Return
prepared or caused to be prepared by Parent (to the extent such income Tax
Return could give rise to indemnification for Parent Indemnified Persons under
this Agreement) at the Stockholders Agents sole cost and expense. Parent
shall consider all reasonable comments of the Stockholders Agent with
respect to such income Tax Returns prior to filing. Any compensation
deductions and other transaction costs (including all Transaction Expenses,
payments of bonuses, deductions associated with the exercise of
Qualifying Company Options and the payment of any amounts associated with the
Closing Bonus Portion and the Deferred Bonus Portion) of the Company or the
Subsidiary, as applicable, arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Law,
be allocated to the Company or the Subsidiary, as applicable, and the Pre-
Closing Tax Period.

 



60 (b) _Liability for Taxes_. All Taxes for any Tax period ending on or before
the Closing Date (each, a "Pre-Closing Tax Period") and the portion (as
determined pursuant to _Section 6.5(c)_) of all Taxes of the Company or the
Subsidiary, as applicable, for any Straddle Period, shall be satisfied from
the Indemnification Escrow Amount to the extent not included in the
calculation of the Adjusted Consideration. The Surviving Corporation or the
Subsidiary, as applicable, shall be responsible for all Taxes of the Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiary, as applicable, for any Tax period that begins
after the Closing Date (each, a "Post-Closing Tax Period") and for its portion
(as determined pursuant to _Section 6.5(c)_) of all Taxes of the
Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary, as applicable, for any Straddle
Period. Any amounts paid from the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Adjusted Consideration unless otherwise
required by Law.

 

(c) _Apportionment of Straddle Period Taxes_. With respect to any Straddle
Period, the Taxes attributable to such Straddle Period shall be apportioned
between the portion of the Straddle Period that begins on the first day of the
Straddle Period and ends on the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Straddle
Period"), which portion shall be satisfied from the Indemnification Escrow
Amount to the extent not included in the calculation of the Adjusted
Consideration, and the portion of the Straddle Period that begins on the
Closing Date and ends on the last day of the Straddle Period ("Post-
Closing Straddle Period"), which portion shall be the responsibility of the
Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary, as applicable. The portion of the Tax
allocated to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall (i) in the case of any
property or similar ad valorem Taxes be deemed to be the amount of such Tax
for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period, and
(ii) in the case of any other Taxes, be deemed equal to the amount that would
be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date. The
portion of the Tax allocated to the Post-Closing Straddle Period shall equal
the balance of the income Tax attributable to the Straddle Period.

(d) _Cooperation_. Parent and the Stockholders Agent shall cooperate fully,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection
with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return or claim for refund and any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to the Companys, the
Surviving Corporations or the Subsidiarys Taxes. Upon request, Parent and
the Stockholders Agent shall provide each other with the information that
either party is required to report pursuant to the Code. Parent shall retain,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to retain, and the Stockholders
Agent, to the extent it has possession on the Closing Date, shall retain,
until the applicable statutes of limitations (including any extensions) have
expired, copies of all Tax Returns, supporting work schedules, and other
records or information that may be relevant to such Tax Returns for all Pre-
Closing Tax Periods (including the Pre-Closing Straddle Period) and shall not
destroy or otherwise dispose of any such records without first providing the
other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and copy the same.

 

(e) _Tax Claims for the Pre-Closing Tax Period_. Without the prior written
consent of the Stockholders Agent, except as required by Law, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and or the Subsidiary not to elect to (i)
apply a refund of Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period as a credit against Taxes
for a Post-Closing Tax Period, or (ii) waive any carry back of a net
operating loss generated during a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period if
in either case it would give rise to a right of any Parent Indemnified Person
to indemnification under this Agreement.

 

(f) _Amendment of Returns; Elections_. Except as required by Law, none of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary shall, after the Closing
Date, amend any Tax Return,

 



61  report or filing of the Company or the Subsidiary with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, including a Straddle Period, without the Stockholders
Agents prior written consent if such amendment could give rise to a right of
Parent Indemnified Persons to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement.
Following the Closing Date, except as required by Law, Parent shall not make,
and shall not permit the Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary to make, any
elections or changes in accounting methods without the Stockholders Agents
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) if such election or change could give rise to a right
of any Parent Indemnified Person to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement.

(g) _Transfer Taxes_. Payment of all sales, use, transfer, real property
transfer, documentary, recording, stock transfer and similar Taxes and fees,
and any deficiency, interest or penalty asserted with respect thereto
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), arising out of or in connection with the
Merger shall be paid (i) one-half by the Stockholders Agent (acting on behalf
and for the benefit of the Company Stockholders and the Qualifying Stock
Purchase Right Holders) from the Stockholders Agent Fund and (ii) one-half
by Parent. The party required by Law shall timely file or cause to be filed
all necessary documentation and Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer
Taxes.

 

Section 6.6 _Confidential Information_. From and after the Closing the
Stockholders Agent will, and will cause each of its Affiliates, advisors,
representatives and agents to, treat and hold as confidential all information
concerning the business and affairs of the Surviving Corporation and Parent
that is not already generally available to the public (the "Confidential
Information"), refrain from using any of the Confidential Information except
in connection with this Agreement, and deliver promptly to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or destroy, upon the written request of Parent, all
tangible embodiments (and all copies) of any Confidential Information that are
in his, her or its possession; provided, however the Stockholders Agent,
subject to the terms and conditions of a reasonable confidentiality
agreement, shall be provided access to Confidential Information to the extent
reasonable to enforce the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document for the benefit of the Company Stockholders and the
Qualifying Stock Purchase Right Holders. In the event that a Stockholders
Agent (or any such other Person) is requested or required (pursuant to written
or oral question or request for information or documents in any Proceeding or
similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, the Stockholders
Agent, as applicable, will notify Parent promptly of the request or
requirement so that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may seek an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
_Section 6.6_. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver hereunder, the Stockholders Agent (or any such other Person) is, on
the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information by
a Governmental Entity, such Company Stockholder, such Qualifying Stock
Purchase Right Holder or Stockholders Agent (or any such other Person), as
applicable, may disclose the Confidential Information to such Governmental
Entity;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Stockholders Agent (or any such
other Person), as applicable, shall use his, her or its best efforts to
obtain, at the reasonable request of Parent, and at Parents cost, an order or
other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion
of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed as Parent shall
designate. The terms of this Agreement shall be deemed Confidential
Information.

 

Section 6.7 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_ _._

 

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to maintain in its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions relating to exculpation or
indemnification for pre-Effective Time acts or omissions of the Companys or
the Subsidiarys former officers and directors holding office before the
Effective Time that are substantially similar to such provisions in effect
under the Company Articles and Company Bylaws on the date hereof, it being the
intent of the Parties that such officers and directors will continue to be
entitled to such exculpation and indemnification for such acts or omissions
to the same extent as they were prior to the Effective Time.

 



62 (b) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause proper provision to
be made so that the successor and assign of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation assumes the obligations set forth in  _Section 6.7(a)_ without
regard to whether any provision of the Company Bylaws would terminate the
exculpation and indemnification rights in Company Bylaws as a result of the
occurrence of such a transaction.

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each of the directors and officers of the Company referred to in this _Section
6.7_ and his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives.

(a) _Notice of Claims_. Any Parent Indemnified Person or Company Indemnified
Person claiming indemnification hereunder (as applicable, the "Claiming
Party") shall give to Stockholders Agent (in the case of a Parent Indemnified
Person) or Parent (in the case of a Company Indemnified Person (as applicable,
the "Responding Party"), written notice of any claim (each, a "Claim") (such
notice, a "Claim Notice") as to which the Claiming Party proposes to demand
indemnification hereunder as soon as reasonably practicable after the Claiming
Party becomes aware of or has received notice of such Claim ( _provided_ that
failure to give timely notice shall not limit the indemnification obligations
of the Responding Party hereunder except to the extent the Responding Party is
prejudiced by the delay in giving, or failure to give, such Claim Notice).
Any written notice of a Claim shall include a reasonably detailed description
of the Claim, the basis for indemnification and a reasonable estimate, if

70 (b) _Objections to Claims; Resolution of Conflicts_.

 

(i) The Responding Party shall have the right to object to any Claim made
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ by delivering written notice of such objection
(each, a "Claim Objection Notice") to the Claiming Party within 30 days
following the Responding Partys receipt of a Claim Notice (such period, the
"Claim Objection Period"). The Claim Objection Notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the basis for the Responding Partys objection to the Claim.
In the event that the Responding Party does not object to a Claim within the
Claim Objection Period, (A) the Responding Party shall be deemed to have
accepted and agreed to the Claim set forth in the Claim Notice and shall be
precluded from raising any objection thereto after the Claim Objection Period,
and (B) the Claiming Parties right to payment in respect of such Claim
(subject to this _Article IX_ ) shall be effective as of the day following the
expiration of the Claim Objection Period.

(ii) In the event the Responding Party timely delivers a Claim Objection
Notice to the Claiming Party pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)(i)_, the Claiming
Party shall have 15 days after receipt of such Claim Objection Notice to
respond thereto in a written statement. If after such 15-day period there
remains a dispute regarding the Claim, the Claiming Party and the Responding
Party shall attempt in good faith for ten days to reach a settlement of such
Claim. If such a settlement is reached with respect to the Claim, the
Claiming Partys right to payment shall be effective as of the date of
settlement.

(iii) If no such settlement can be reached after good faith negotiation

such Claim in accordance with  _Section 10.6_.

(iv) This _Section 9.2(b)_ shall not apply to any Proceeding for, or in any
way limit the rights and remedies of any Party with respect to such Partys
right to seek, specific performance, injunctive or declaratory relief or other

choice; _provided_ that Parent must conduct the defense of such Parent Control
Claim diligently and in good faith and keep the Stockholders Agent reasonably
informed of the status of such Parent Control Claim. Stockholders Agent may
retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in
(but not control) the defense of, and Parent shall in good faith consider the
input of Stockholders Agent (or its representatives) with respect to, such
Parent Control Claim. Parent shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect such Parent Control Claim without the
prior written consent of the Stockholders Agent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless Parent agrees to be
fully responsible for such Parent Control Claim. Each Parent Indemnified
Person will be entitled to make a claim against the Indemnification Escrow
Amount for any Damages the Claiming Party may suffer to the extent resulting
from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by any Parent
Control Claim to the fullest extent provided in this _Article IX_.

 

(ii) Except with respect to Parent Control Claims, which shall be governed by

retain one separate co-counsel at the Responding Partys sole cost and
expense and participate in (but not control) the defense of, and the
Responding Party shall in good faith consider the input of the Claiming Party
(or its counsel) with respect to, such Third-Party Claim. The
Responding Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Claiming Party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless the judgment or proposed settlement
involves only the payment of money damages by the Claiming Party (and, in the
case of any Parent Indemnified Person, such money damages are then fully
available to be disbursed from the Indemnification Escrow Amount), does not
impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Claiming Party or
impose any future limitations of the Claiming Partys business or operations,
and includes, as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff to the Claiming Party and its Affiliates of a release (in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Claiming Party) from all Liability in
respect of such Third-Party Claim. The Responding Party will remain
responsible for any Damages the Claiming Party may suffer to the extent
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by
such Third-Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this _Article IX_.

Control Claim), as applicable, does not elect to assume the defense, control

Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The

may suffer to the extent resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the
nature of, or caused by the Third-Party Claim to the fullest extent provided
in this _Article IX_.

(iv) Any Third Party Claim relating to Taxes of the Company (or for which
the Company may be liable) shall be governed by the provisions of _Section
6.5_ to the extent inconsistent with this _Section 9.2(c)_.

shall cooperate with each other in the defense of any Claim hereunder and
shall make reasonably available to the Party or Parties defending such Claim
such materials and assistance relating thereto as is reasonably requested from
such Person.

this Agreement or in any other Transaction Document to which a Party is a
party and all related rights to indemnification shall survive the Closing and
the consummation of the Merger for a period of 24 months following the Closing
Date. Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article IX_, the
covenants and obligations of the Parties shall survive until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Article IX_, no Company Indemnified Person or Parent
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification for any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty unless a Claim with respect
thereto is asserted in accordance with this _Article IX_ on or prior to 11:59
p.m., Eastern Time, on the date that is 24 months after the Closing Date.

 



72 (b) _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements until
Final Determination_. For each Claim for indemnification hereunder regarding
a representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement that is made
before the expiration of such representation, warranty, covenant, obligation
or agreement, such Claim and any associated right to indemnification will not
terminate until the final determination with respect to, and, if applicable,
satisfaction of such Claim.

 

Section 9.4 _Limitations_.

 

(a) _Deductible_. Neither the Company Indemnified Persons nor the Parent
Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section
9.1(a)(i)_ or _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ (other than in respect of a Special
Representation), as applicable, unless and until the aggregate amount of all
Damages of all Company Indemnified Persons and Parent Indemnified Persons,
respectively, under this _Article IX_ exceeds $500,000 (the "Deductible
Amount"). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Damages to which the Company
Indemnified Persons and Parent Indemnified Persons are entitled pursuant to
this _Article IX_ exceed the Deductible Amount, then the Company Indemnified
Persons and the Parent Indemnified Persons, respectively, will be entitled
indemnification to the extent provided in this _Article IX_ for all such
Damages in excess of the Deductible Amount and thereafter no such deductible
limitation shall be applicable to Damages to which the Company Indemnified
Persons and the Parent Indemnified Persons are entitled pursuant to this
_Article IX_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in determining
whether the aggregate amount of Damages exceeds the Deductible Amount, all
Damages shall be included in such determination.

 

(b) _Individual Claim Threshold_. Neither the Company Indemnified Persons nor
the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to _Section 9.1(a)(i)_ or _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ (other than in respect of a
Special Representation), as applicable, with respect to any Claim (or set of
Claims arising out of the same set of facts or event) that involves Damages
of less than $25,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Damages with respect to
such Claim (or set of Claims) equal or exceed $25,000, then the full amount of
such Claim (or set of Claims) shall be payable to the applicable Company
Indemnified Persons or Parent Indemnified Persons, as applicable, subject to
the limitations contained in this _Article IX_ (such amount intended to be a
threshold and not a deductible).

 

(c) _Cap_. Except as expressly contemplated by _Section 9.4(d)_, the maximum
amount of Damages in the aggregate to which the Company Indemnified Persons
or Parent Indemnified Persons, as applicable, are entitled to indemnification
shall not exceed (i) in the case of the Company Indemnified Persons, an
aggregate amount equal to the Indemnification Escrow Amount, and (ii) in the
case of the Parent Indemnified Persons, the Indemnification Escrow Amount then
held in the Indemnification Escrow Account.

 

(d) _Recourse_.

(i) The Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to make Claims for
any Damages incurred in connection with any Transaction Document to which the
Company or the Stockholders Agent is a party from any source other than the
Indemnification Escrow Account; _provided_ that the Parent Indemnified
Persons shall be entitled to make Claims for monetary Damages directly against
the Stockholders Agent in respect of any Claim for Company Transaction
Expenses pursuant to  _Section 9.1(a)(iii)_. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Parent Indemnified Persons
right to seek monetary damages from any particular Key Employee for any
alleged or actual breach of such Key Employees Noncompetition Agreement
shall not be subject to any limitation set forth in this Agreement.

(ii) Nothing contained in this _Section 9.4(d)_ shall limit Parents and the
Surviving Corporations rights to specific performance and other equitable
remedies as set forth in _Section 9.7_.

 



73 Section 9.5 _Materiality Qualifiers_. For purposes of this _Article IX_ ,
in determining (a) whether a breach of a representation or warranty made by
the Company in this Agreement (other than pursuant to _Section 3.5(a)_ or the
Company Closing Certificate with respect to the same), or in any other
Transaction Document to which the Company is a party, including any
certificate delivered hereunder, has occurred and (b) the amount of Damages
arising out of, relating to or resulting therefrom, all Materiality Qualifiers
will be ignored and each such representation and warranty will be read and
interpreted without regard to any Materiality Qualifier.

Section 9.6 _Rights to Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed by the Company or the Stockholders Agent in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions,
without the posting of any bond, to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the
Company or the Stockholders Agent, and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which Parent
or Merger Sub is entitled at law or in equity.

 

Section 9.7 _Knowledge and Investigation_. All representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements and indemnities of each Party contained in this
Agreement and in the other Transaction Documents shall be deemed material and
relied upon by the other Parties, regardless of any knowledge or investigation
or any representation made by the other Parties, and none will be waived by
any failure to pursue any action or by consummation of the Merger and the
Other Transactions.

Section 9.8 _Other Factors Not Limiting_. No representation or warranty
contained herein will limit the generality or applicability of any other
representation or warranty. The terms of this _Article IX_ will be enforceable
regardless of whether Liability is based on past, present or future acts,
claims or legal requirements and regardless of any sole, concurrent,
contributory, comparative or similar negligence, or of any sole, concurrent,
strict or similar Liability, of any Parent Indemnified Person.

Section 9.9 _Effect of Officer s Certificates_. For the avoidance of doubt,
any written certification by a Person (or any officer thereof) of the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, including any certification
contemplated in _Section 7.2_ or _7.3_ , will be deemed to constitute the
making or re-making of such representation or warranty by such Person at the
time of such certification in the manner and to the extent stated in such
certification, including for purposes of _Section 9.1(a)_.

 

Section 9.10 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, from and after the Closing, the provisions of this _Article IX_
(including the rights to specific performance set forth in _Section 9.7_)
shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of any Parent Indemnified
Person for Damages arising out of, caused by, or resulting from any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation in this
Agreement.

Section 9.11  _Mitigation_. Each of the Parent Indemnified Persons and the
Company Indemnified Persons shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate their Damages.

 

Section 9.12 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Parties agree that any
indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Adjusted Consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Law.

 



74 Section 9.13 _Insurance Proceeds and Other Recoveries_. The amount of
Damages recoverable by an indemnified Person pursuant to this ARTICLE IX
shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds or other amounts actually
recovered by such indemnified Person with respect to the Damages to which such
indemnity claim relates, net of any expenses related to the receipt of such
payment, including any premium increases or retrospective premium adjustments,
if any, occasioned by such Damages; _provided_ , that this _Section 9.14_
shall not be construed to require any Person to obtain any insurance
coverage, but if insurance coverage is available, such Party shall notify the
other and the indemnifying Persons may require a claim to be made under any
such insurance coverage.

 

Section 9.14 _No Duplication_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to
the extent an item is taken into account for purposes of calculating the
Adjusted Consideration, it shall not be counted more than once and Parent

Section where they appear); (c) terms used in the plural include the singular,
and vice versa, unless the context clearly requires otherwise; (d) unless
expressly stated herein to the contrary, and specifically excluding any

accordance with the terms thereof; (e) unless expressly stated herein to the
contrary, reference to any Law means such Law as amended, modified, codified,

no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any
party hereto by virtue of the authorship of any of the terms hereof or

competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto

extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

and controversies arising hereunder or related hereto shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without
reference to such states principles of conflicts of law. Each party hereto

any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters
contemplated herein, and agrees that process may be served upon it in any
manner authorized by the Laws of the State of Delaware for such Persons and
waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which it might
otherwise have to such jurisdiction and such process; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any party hereto shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable

78  hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made to such party contained in any Transaction Document and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such
party contained in any Transaction Document. Any such extension or waiver by

extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

 

Section 10.11 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
