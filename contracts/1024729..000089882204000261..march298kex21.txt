Section 2.7. Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or any holder of any shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred
Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:   (a) Common Stock of
Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger
Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (b)
Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company (or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiaries) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(i) shall automatically be cancelled and retired, and (ii) shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   (c)
Conversion of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock. Subject to
the terms and upon the conditions herein (including Schedule 5.2 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule), (i) each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.7(b) and the Appraisal
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal
to $182,000 ("Common Stock Merger Consideration"), and (ii) each share of
Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section
2.7(b) and the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the Common Stock Merger
Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
into which each such share of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately    -10-   prior to the Effective Time is convertible
("Preferred Stock Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub, or the holders thereof, all such shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically cease to exist and each holder of a Certificate shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive (Y) for
each share of Company Common Stock, the Common Stock Merger Consideration,
and (Z) for each share of Company Preferred Stock, the Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration, in each case, in accordance with this Section 2.7(c).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, upon surrender of any
Certificate representing fractional shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock, the holder thereof shall be paid the cash value of
such fraction, which shall be equal to such fraction multiplied by the Common
Stock Merger Consideration or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration with
respect thereto, as the case may be.   (d) Appraisal Rights.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 ("Appraisal
Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the consideration
payable as provided in Section 2.7(c), but instead such holder shall be
entitled to such rights (but only such rights) as are granted by Section 262.
At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically cease to exist, and, except as otherwise provided by
applicable law, each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, other than such rights as are granted by Section
262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to validly
perfect or shall otherwise waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262 or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine
that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then
the rights of such holder under Section 262 shall cease, and such Appraisal
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and
shall have become, the right to receive the consideration payable as provided
in Section 2.7(c). The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock, and Parent shall have the opportunity to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.   Section 2.8.
Surrender and Payment.   (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, for
the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock,
Company Options and Company Warrants, Parent shall designate, or shall cause
to be designated (pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company), a bank or trust company acceptable to
the Company, in its reasonable discretion, to act as agent for the payment of
the cash amounts contemplated pursuant to Section 2.7(c) and Section 2.9 upon
surrender of Certificates in accordance with this Article II ("Paying
Agent"), from time to time at or after the Effective Time. At or promptly
after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause Merger    
-11-   Sub to deposit, with the Paying Agent cash in the amounts sufficient
for the payment of the aggregate amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.7(c)
and Section 2.9.   (b) Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof but in no event later than the tenth
business day prior to the anticipated Closing Date (as mutually and
reasonably determined by Parent and the Company), Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of
letter of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal") (that shall (A) specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and (B) be in customary form reasonably
acceptable to the Company and Parent with no representations or warranties or
indemnities from holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred
Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants other than customary
representations and warranties from such holders with respect to ownership of
such stock, warrants or options and the right to sell such stock, warrants or
options, and (C) have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of Certificates in exchange for the amount of cash such holder shall be
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.7(c) and Section 2.9.
Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent consistent with this Section 2.8(b), the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of
cash into which the shares, options or warrants formerly represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.7(c) and Section
2.9, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Parent\'s agreement with the Paying Agent shall provide that, upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, any holder of shares
of Company Common Stock (including shares issuable upon the exercise of
Company Options and Company Warrants) and Company Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive payment of (1) the amount of cash such holder shall be
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.7(c) in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, and (2) the amount of
cash such holder shall be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.9 in
respect of any Company Options and Company Warrants, in each case, held by
them on the Closing Date, in each case, by check or, at such holder\'s
request, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s)
designated by such stockholder on the earlier of (X) the Closing Date, if
such holder surrendered such Certificate to the Paying Agent on or prior to
11:00 a.m. New York City time on the Closing Date, and (Y) the first business
day after such delivery, if such delivery is made after such time. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred
Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants that is not registered in the
stock transfer books of the Company, the proper amount of cash may be paid in
exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the
cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.   (c) Stock Transfer Books.
At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock      -12-   transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock or Company Options
and Company Warrants that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or for any other
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.   (d) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. All funds held by the Paying Agent for payment to the
holders of unsurrendered Certificates and unclaimed at the end of 6 months
after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, after which time any
holder of unsurrendered Certificates shall look as a general creditor only to
the Surviving Corporation for payment of such funds to which such holder may
be due, subject to applicable law.   (e) Lost Documents. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the amount of cash contemplated
pursuant to Section 2.7(c) or Section 2.9, as the case may be.   (f)
Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock, Company Preferred Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants, such
amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of U.S. state or local tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock, Company
Preferred Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent.   Section 2.9. Company Options and Company
Warrants.   (a) Except as separately agreed to by Parent and any Person
holding Company Options, subject to and upon the terms and conditions herein,
all stock options (the "Company Options") granted under the Company\'s 1997
Stock Incentive Plan, as amended ("Company Option Plan"), or otherwise, which
remain unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time shall immediately
vest and become exercisable pursuant to the provisions of the Company Options
at the Effective Time. Except as separately agreed to by Parent and any
Person holding Company Options, all Company Options shall be immediately
cancelled concurrently with the Effective Time and each holder of a Company
Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number
of shares (or fraction thereof) of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company      -13-   Option at the time of such cancellation,
multiplied by (ii) the positive excess of (A) the Common Stock Merger
Consideration, over (B) the per share exercise price of such Company Option
("Company Option Consideration"). Upon surrender of such Company Options,
such Company Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist and each former holder of such Company
Options shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto.   (b) Subject
to the terms and conditions herein, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub,
or holders of Company Warrants, all Company Warrants shall no longer
represent the right to receive shares of Company Common Stock upon the due
exercise thereof, and each holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, and all Company Warrants shall thereafter represent the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares (or fraction thereof) of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Warrant as of the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the positive excess of
(A) the value of the Common Stock Merger Consideration over (B) the per share
exercise price of such Company Warrant ("Company Warrant Consideration").
Upon surrender of such Company Warrants, such Company Warrants shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist and each former holder of such Company Warrants shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto.   Section 2.10. Restricted Stock. The
restrictions on each share of Company Common Stock ("Company Restricted
Stock") granted under the Company Option Plan or otherwise shall lapse
immediately prior to, and effective upon occurrence of, the Effective Time,
and each share of Company Restricted Stock shall be fully vested in each
holder thereof at such time, and each such share of Company Restricted Stock
will be treated at the Effective Time the same as, and have the same rights
and be subject to the same conditions (including the conditions set forth in
Section 2.8) hereunder as, each share of Company Common Stock not subject to
any restrictions as provided in Section 2.7(c).    ARTICLE III

Material Adverse Effect. The copies of the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, or other organizational documents (in each case, together with all
amendments thereto) of the Company and each of its Significant Subsidiaries

termination or acceleration of or entitle any party to terminate, accelerate,
modify or cancel (whether after the giving of notice or lapse of time or
both) any obligation under, or constitute a default (with or without notice
or lapse of time, or both), or result in (or with notice or the passage of
time would result in) the imposition of any lien upon or the creation of a

"Company Required Governmental Approvals").   (e) The Board of Directors of
the Company, at a meeting duly called and held, adopted resolutions that are

vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, with
each share of Company Common Stock entitled to one vote and each share of

Section 3.6. Information. The information supplied or incorporated
by reference by the Company for inclusion in any information to be sent or

there are no judgments or outstanding orders, injunctions, decrees,
stipulations or awards (whether rendered by a Governmental Authority, or by

its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.   Section 3.8. Compliance with Laws;

neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of or has

412 or 4971 of the Code, the Company has not incurred any material liability

amounts payable under any Company Plan to fail to be deductible for federal
income tax purposes by virtue of section 280G of the Code.   (g) With

such confidentiality agreement shall terminate; provided that Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company may disclose such information as may be necessary in
connection with seeking the Parent Required Governmental Approvals, the
Company Required Governmental Approvals and the Company Stockholder Approval;
provided further that if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Article IX of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time, the Confidentiality

Efforts; Obtaining Consents.   (a) Prior to the Closing, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company, on the one hand,
and each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable law and regulations to consummate and make effective as promptly
as practicable the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
necessary waivers, consents and/or approvals of third parties required in
order to preserve material contractual relationships of Parent, the Company
and their respective Subsidiaries (such waivers, consent and approvals, the
"Third Party Consents"), all necessary waivers, consents or approvals
to effect all necessary registrations, filings and submissions and to lift
any injunction or other legal bar to the consummation of the Merger or
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and, in such case, to
proceed with the consummation of the Merger as expeditiously as possible),
including through all possible appeals; provided, however, except as
otherwise provided in the Company Disclosure Schedule, notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, nothing herein shall require the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or Merger Sub to make any out-of-pocket
expenses, accrue any liability for its account or make any accommodation or
concession to Parent, Merger Sub or any third party in connection with the
foregoing.   (b) In addition to and without limitation of the foregoing,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company undertakes and agrees to (i) file
(and Parent agrees to cause any Person that may be deemed to be the ultimate
parent entity or otherwise to control Parent to file, if such filing is
required by law) as soon as practicable, and in any event prior to ten
business days after the date hereof, a Notification and Report Form under the

additional information or documentation, and (ii) not extend any waiting
period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any Governmental
Authority not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except with the prior consent of the other parties hereto (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Parent and the Company shall
take any and all commercially reasonable steps necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition, or
trade law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to
the Merger so as to enable the Effective Time to occur as soon as reasonably
possible and to avoid any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the
effect of preventing or delaying the Effective Time. Each party shall (i)
promptly notify the other party of any written communication to that party or
its Affiliates from any Governmental Authority and, subject to applicable
law, permit the other party to review in advance any proposed
written communication to any of the foregoing; (ii) not agree to participate,
or to permit its affiliates to participate, in any substantive meeting or
discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,

Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat; and (iii) furnish the other party with copies of all
correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between them and their affiliates and their respective
representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of
their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the Merger (except that the Company shall be under no obligation of any kind
to provide any other party documents, material or other information relating
to the valuation of the Company or to alternatives to the proposed Merger and
this Agreement).   (c) In addition to and without limitation to the
foregoing, in connection with the Acquisition Financing, Parent shall apply
for and use its commercially reasonable efforts to receive and maintain a
credit rating by Moody\'s Investor Services, Inc. and Standard and Poor\'s
Ratings Group, a division of The McGraw Hill Corporation.   Section 5.3.
Further Assurances.   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and not in limitation of any such provisions including Section 5.2,
each party hereby agrees to use all reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws to satisfy all
conditions to, and to consummate, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to carry out the purposes hereof, including to perform and
cause to be performed any further acts and to execute and deliver and cause
to be executed and delivered any documents that may be reasonably necessary
to carry out the provisions of this Agreement; provided that, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement,    -30-    notwithstanding
anything to the contrary stated in this Agreement, the Company shall not be
required to pay any consideration for any third-party consent or waiver.  
(b) The parties shall engage, at the Company\'s expense (payable at Closing),
a valuation firm of national reputation reasonably acceptable to the Company,
its stockholders and Parent, to deliver a letter addressed to the Company,
its stockholders and Parent and indicating that at and immediately after the
Effective Time, and after giving effect to the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company will not (i) be insolvent (either
because its financial condition is such that the sum of its debts is greater
than the fair market value of its assets or because the fair saleable value
of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its probable liability
on its existing debts as they mature), (ii) have unreasonably small capital
with which to engage in its business or (iii) have incurred debts beyond its
ability to pay as they become due.   Section 5.4. Conduct of Business.

respects.   (b) Except as contemplated by this Agreement, as set forth in
the Company Disclosure Schedule or as otherwise required to maintain the
business and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, consistent with past
practice, the Company shall not, and shall not cause or allow any of its

or public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall

of Parent and the Company, except as such release or public announcement may
be required by law, rule or regulation, in which case the party required to
issue the release or announcement shall allow Parent and the Company, as
applicable, reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of its issuance.   Section 5.6. Employment Benefits
Arrangements.   (a) For twelve months following the Closing ("Benefits
Continuation Period"), Parent shall maintain, or cause the Company to
maintain, for the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Closing who continue employment following the Closing ("Employees"),
compensation and employee benefits except for equity or equity related
compensation that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Closing. Parent agrees that, from and after the Closing, Parent will honor or
will cause the Company to honor, all obligations under the Plans, Foreign
Plans, and Individual Agreements, provided that, subject to the foregoing
sentence, from and after the Closing, the Company shall have the right to
amend, modify, alter or terminate any    -34-   specific Plan or Foreign
Plan to the extent the terms of such Plan or Foreign Plan permit such
action.   (b) For all purposes of determining eligibility and vesting under
any Plan (or similar plan maintained by the Company after Closing (a "New
Plan")), each Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service
with the Company and its Affiliates (and with any additional years of service
credited under the Plans and Foreign Plans) before the Closing, to the same
extent as such Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such
service under any similar Plans, except to the extent such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each Employee shall be immediately eligible
to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all employee benefit
plans sponsored by Parent and its Affiliates for the benefit of Employees
(such plans, collectively, the "New Plans") to the extent coverage under such
New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Plan of the Company in which
such Employee participated immediately before the Closing (such plans,
collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions of such
New Plan to be waived for such Employee and his or her covered dependents,
and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Employee and
his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old
Plan ending on the date such Employee\'s participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.   (c) Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitutes a "Change in
Control" under the Company Option Plan.   Section 5.7. Indebtedness. (a) On
the Closing Date, simultaneously with the Closing, Parent shall cause all
outstanding Obligations to be paid in full, providing funds to the Company to
do so if necessary, and immediately upon such payment and any other payments
in connection thereto, cause the Loan Agreement to be cancelled and be of no
further force and effect. Parent agrees to comply and to cause the Company to
comply with its obligations to conduct a "Change of Control Offer", as such
term is defined in Section 4.13 of the Indenture, pursuant to Section 4.13 of
the Indenture, if applicable, and to comply and to cause the Company to
comply with all of its other obligations under the Credit Agreements and any
other existing indebtedness in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.   (b) The Company shall (provided that Parent and Merger Sub
shall coordinate with the Company regarding such timing) (i) commence a cash
tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes and
(ii) solicit the consent of the holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes
regarding the amendments (the "Indenture Amendments") described on Schedule
5.7 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule to the covenants contained in the
Indenture. Such offer to purchase and consent solicitation (the "Debt Offer")
shall be made substantially on such terms and conditions as are described on
Schedule 5.7 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule; provided that, in any event,
the parties agree that the terms and conditions of the Debt Offer shall   
-35-   provide that the closing thereof shall be contingent upon the
consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time. The Company shall not
without the Parent\'s prior consent, waive any condition to the Debt Offer
described on Schedule 5.7 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, or make any
changes to the terms and conditions of the Debt Offer, except, in each case,
as provided in paragraph (c) below with respect to termination of this
Agreement. The Company covenants and agrees that, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including the terms and conditions to the Debt
Offer, it will accept for payment, and pay for, the Senior Subordinated Notes
and effect the Indenture Amendments, in each case, immediately after, and
contingent upon, the Effective Time.   (c) Promptly following the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall prepare an offer to purchase the Senior
Subordinated Notes and forms of the related letters of transmittal, as well
as all other information and exhibits that may be necessary or advisable in
connection with the Debt Offer (collectively, the "Offer Documents"). In the
event that this Agreement is terminated, the Company will have the right to
amend the Offer Documents and otherwise terminate the Debt Offer without
Parent\'s consent. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Offer Documents to be mailed to the holders of the Senior Subordinated
Notes as soon as practicable following the preparation of the Offer
Documents.   (d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
should be discovered by any party hereto, which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents mailed to holders of Senior
Subordinated Notes so that such documents would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and, to the extent required by applicable
law, the Company shall promptly prepare an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information, and, if required, shall disseminate
such amendment or supplement to the holders of the Senior Subordinated
Notes.   (e) Parent and Merger Sub shall, immediately prior to the
Effective Time deposit sufficient funds to a paying agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company to pay all of the amounts owing with respect to all
outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes, including the aggregate principal
amount outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, accrued interest
and any fees or charges associated therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement (including Section 5.4), from the date hereof
through the Closing, the Company may use any available cash and cash
equivalents at the Company and its Subsidiaries to pay amounts outstanding
under the Credit Agreements.   Section 5.8. Directors\' and Officers\'
Indemnification.   (a) For a period of six years from the Effective Time,
the provisions of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or similar
organization documents, of the Company and of each of its Subsidiaries
concerning elimination of liability and indemnification of directors and
officers shall not be amended in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any Person that is as of the date of this Agreement an
officer or director of the Company or of any such Subsidiary except as may be
required by applicable law. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and   
-36-   stand surety for, and shall cause the Company to honor, in
accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in
this Section 5.8. In addition to the foregoing, from and after the Closing
Date, to the extent permitted by applicable law Parent and the Company,
jointly and severally, shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend each Person
who is a current or former officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries against all losses and expenses (including all losses, costs,
obligations, liabilities, settlement payments, awards, judgments, fines,
penalties, damages (including compensatory, punitive and consequential
damages), demands, claims, actions, causes of action, assessments,
deficiencies and other charges and attorneys\' fees) arising out of or
pertaining to acts or omissions (or alleged acts or omissions) by them
in their capacities as such, which acts or omissions occurred at or prior to
the Closing. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the
indemnification and related rights hereunder shall be mandatory rather than
permissive, and Parent and/or the Company shall promptly advance expenses in
connection with such indemnification to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law; provided that, to the extent required by law, the Person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification. At the Closing, Parent shall assume and become liable for,
jointly and severally with the Company and each such Subsidiary, any
liability and all obligations of the Company and each such Subsidiary under
such provisions.   (b) For six years from the Closing Date, Parent shall
cause the Company to maintain officers\' and directors\' fiduciary and
liability insurance covering the Persons who are presently covered by the
Company\'s (and any Subsidiary\'s) officers\' and directors\' fiduciary and
liability insurance policies (copies of which have heretofore been made
available to Parent) with respect to actions and omissions occurring on or
prior to the Closing Date, on terms which are no less favorable to such
Persons than the terms of such current insurance in effect for the Company on
the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Company be obligated to pay aggregate annual premiums greater than 250% of
the aggregate annual premiums paid or payable as of the date of this
Agreement; provided, further, that if the aggregate annual premium for such
coverage and amount of insurance would exceed 250% of such annual rate, the
Company shall provide the greatest coverage which shall then be available at
an aggregate annual premium equal to 250% of such rate. The Company will
maintain, through the Effective Time, the Company\'s existing directors\'
and officers\' fiduciary and liability insurance in full force and effect
without reduction of coverage. The Company represents to Parent that the
annual premium in connection with the Company\'s existing directors\' and
officers\' fiduciary and liability insurance as of the date hereof is
$102,515.   (c) Following the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section
5.8 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder, and each such Person\'s
heirs, representatives, successors or assigns, it being expressly agreed that
such Persons shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section, and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.  
(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by any director or officer
in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section
5.8.    -37-     (e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in
either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.   Section 5.9.
Stockholder Approval; Drag-Along. The Company shall, promptly after the date
hereof, use reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders of the
Company their approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) at a meeting of the stockholders
called for such purpose. GSCPII shall, to the extent practicable under the
Stockholders\' Agreement, exercise its "Drag-Along Right" (as defined in the
Stockholders\' Agreement) with respect holders of Company Common
Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants who are parties to the
Stockholders\' Agreement by a date that is reasonably calculated to permit
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby no later than the
Closing Date that would otherwise be expected to occur.   Section 5.10.
Restrictions on Parent and the Company. Parent and the Company agree that,
from and after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, and except as
may be agreed in writing by the other parties hereto or as may be expressly
permitted pursuant to this Agreement, it shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Subsidiaries to, agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any action
that could reasonably be expected to delay the consummation of the Merger or
result in the failure to satisfy any condition to consummation of
the Merger.   Section 5.11. Merger Sub. Parent will take all action
necessary (i) to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and (ii) to ensure that, prior to the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall not conduct any business or activities or make any
investments other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, or
incur or guarantee any indebtedness.   Section 5.12. Company Warrants.
Subject to Section 2.9, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree to take all
actions required pursuant to the Company Warrant Agreement to ensure that the
Company Warrants, if outstanding following the Effective Time, shall
thereafter be exercisable for the Company Warrant Consideration, including,
by entering into a supplemental warrant agreement in the form required by the
Company Warrant Agreement. At the Effective Time, the Company Warrants shall
be assumed by, and shall be an obligation of, the Surviving Corporation to
pay, and a right of holders thereof to receive in full satisfaction of such
Company Warrants, Company Warrant Consideration in accordance with Article II
of this Agreement and the Company Warrant Agreement.   Section 5.13. FIRPTA
Certificate; Affidavits. Either (a) the Company shall provide to Parent on
the Closing Date (i) a certification from the Company which complies with
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(c)(3), dated no more than 30 days prior

the documentation described in clause (a) is not delivered to Parent on or
prior to the Closing Date, and to the extent that any stockholder of the
Company fails to provide the Paying Agent with the affidavit described in

(b).   Section 5.14. Notice of Developments. Each party hereto shall
give prompt written notice to the other party of (i) the occurrence, or
failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur would

party in this Merger Agreement or in any Schedule to be untrue or inaccurate

any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with, performed by or
satisfied by it under this Merger Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing,

Financing is no longer available or is no longer reasonably expected to be
available from the same financing sources and on terms and conditions

agreement hereunder.    ARTICLE VI   CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF

respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain financing with no
greater cost of capital to Parent and Merger Sub and other terms no less
favorable in the aggregate to Parent than the terms contained in the

transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 7.6. Agreement with GSCPII.
GSCPII shall have entered into a letter agreement with Parent in the form set
forth in Schedule 7.6 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.   Section 7.7.

Merger Sub contained in Section 4.5 this Agreement shall be true and correct
at and as of the Closing, as though made at and as of such time without
reference to the qualification "as of the date hereof" set forth therein;

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 8.3. Certificates.

that any condition set forth in Article VI or VII shall not be satisfied, or

Away Date"); or   (c) the Company, in the event that any condition set forth
in Article VI or VIII shall not be satisfied, or shall not be capable of
being satisfied, by the Walk-Away Date;  provided, however, that no party
may terminate this Agreement pursuant to clauses (b) or (c), if the failure
of the applicable condition in Article VI, VII or VIII (as the case may be)
to be satisfied or the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the date
referred to in the applicable paragraph results from (i) the willful and
material breach by such party of any covenant in this Agreement, or (ii) such
party\'s failure to use its required efforts to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.   Section 9.2. Procedure and Effect of Termination. In
the event of termination of this Agreement by a party hereto entitled to

shall forthwith be given by the terminating party to the other party hereto,
and this Agreement shall thereupon terminate and become void and have no
effect, and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned without
further action by the parties hereto, except that the provisions of Sections
5.1(b) and 10.4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement; provided,
however, that such termination shall not relieve any party hereto of any
liability for any willful breach of any covenant or agreement of such party
contained in this Agreement.    ARTICLE X   MISCELLANEOUS    Section

SHALL BE GOVERNED IN ALL RESPECTS, INCLUDING VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND
EFFECT, BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS EXECUTED
AND TO BE PERFORMED WHOLLY WITHIN SUCH STATE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE
CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES OF SUCH STATE.   Section 10.3. Entire Agreement.
This Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Support Agreements contain
the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement and supercede all prior agreements, understandings, and
negotiations, both written and oral between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.   Section 10.4. Expenses. Except as
otherwise set forth in this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Schedule,
each party shall be responsible for and shall pay all costs and expenses
incurred by such party in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated this Agreement, whether the Merger is or is not consummated;
provided, however, that (i) in the event that the Merger is to be consummated
the Company shall not pay in excess of the amounts disclosed in Section 10.4
of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (ii) in the event that this Agreement
is terminated for any reason whatsoever, Parent shall upon such termination
reimburse one half of the aggregate amount, of all of the out-of-pocket fees
and expenses, incurred by or on behalf of, or paid or to be paid by, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Debt Offer (including fees
and expenses of counsel, investment bankers and accountants). No later than
one business day prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Parent pay-off letters or final invoices for the amounts disclosed in
Section 10.4 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The pay-off letters or final
invoices shall provide that the amounts set forth therein represent payment
in full for all fees and expenses payable by the Company in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than in connection with
the Debt Offer.   Section 10.5. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed
in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the
same agreement, and shall become effective against the parties that have
executed and delivered the Agreement when one or more counterparts have been
signed by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and delivered to Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company.   Section 10.6. Successors and Assigns. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of
the other party. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be    
-44-   binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors or assigns, heirs, legatees, distributees,
executors, administrators and guardians. At the election of Parent, any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent may be substituted for
Merger Sub as a constituent corporation in the Merger, so long as such
substitution would not reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material
delay in the obtaining of, or significantly increase the risk of not
obtaining any Company Required Governmental Approval or Parent Required
Governmental Approval or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period, (ii) significantly increase the risk of any Governmental
Authority entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (iii)
significantly increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on
appeal or otherwise, (iv) materially delay the consummation of the Merger or
(v) otherwise negatively effect the Company or its stockholders. If the
requirements of the previous sentence are met and Parent wishes to
designate another wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to be a
constituent corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, then all references herein to
Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary, except that
all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as
of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties
made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such
designation.   Section 10.7. Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement, and the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, may be modified, waived or amended to
the extent permitted by law by an instrument or instruments in writing signed
by the party against whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment
is sought (or, in the case of a waiver, by the intended beneficiary of the
waived term or provision); provided that any such modification or amendment
must be authorized by the respective Boards of Directors of each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at
any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a
waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this
Agreement or any part of this Agreement or the right of any party thereafter
to enforce each and every such provision. The waiver by any party hereto of a
breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a
waiver of any subsequent breach.   Section 10.8. No Implied Representation.
Notwithstanding anything contained in Article III or IV or any other
provision of this Agreement, it is the explicit intent of each party hereto
that the Company is making no representation or warranty whatsoever, express
or implied, beyond those expressly given in this Agreement, including any
implied warranty or representation as to condition, merchantability or
suitability as to any of the properties or assets of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and it is understood that Parent and Merger Sub
takes the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as is and where is. It
is understood that any estimates, projections or other predictions contained
or referred to in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure
Schedule or in the materials that have been provided to Parent are not and
shall not be deemed to be representations or warranties of the Company.  
Section 10.9. Construction of Certain Provisions. It is understood and agreed
that the specification of any dollar amount in the representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific
item in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule is
not intended to imply that such amounts or higher or lower amounts, or the
items so included or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall
use    -45-   the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the
inclusion of any such item in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent
Disclosure Schedule in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described in this Agreement or
included in Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule is
or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.   Section 10.10.
Headings. The Section and Article headings contained in this Agreement are
inserted for convenience of reference only and will not affect the meaning or

insofar as it relates to director and officer indemnification, shall inure

entitled to such indemnification. Except as otherwise provided by the terms
hereof, this Agreement shall not confer upon any Person not a party hereto
(or their successors and assigns permitted by Section 10.6) any rights or
remedies hereunder.   Section 10.13. Partial Invalidity. Wherever possible,
each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but in case any one or more of the
provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement,
and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision or provisions had never been contained in this
Agreement, unless the deletion of such provision or provisions would result
in such a material change as to cause completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby to be unreasonable.   Section 10.14. Consent to
Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the
personal jurisdiction of any federal court located in the State of Delaware
or any Delaware state court, in either case, located in Wilmington, Delaware,
in the event any    -46-    dispute arises out of this Agreement or any

court sitting in the State of Delaware or a Delaware state court, in either
case, located in Wilmington, Delaware.   Section 10.15. Waiver of Jury

ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
