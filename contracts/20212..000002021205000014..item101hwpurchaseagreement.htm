Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to obtain such  consents to the assignment of the Contracts as may be required. Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that  at the Closing, Seller will not assign to Buyer any Contract that by its terms  requires, prior to such assignment, the consent of any other contracting party  thereto unless such consent has been obtained prior to the Closing Date.

Seller will promptly pay to Buyer when  received all monies received by Seller under any Asset or any claim, right or  benefit arising thereunder not transferred to Buyer pursuant to this  Section 6.4.

Except as otherwise provided herein, Buyer shall maintain, or shall caused to be maintained, for at least seven (7) years all original books, records, files, documents, papers and agreements pertaining to the Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or to the Racetrack Business before the Closing. If, at any time, Buyer proposes to dispose of any of such original documents, Buyer shall first provide Seller with sixty (60) days written notice of such proposal and shall offer to deliver the original documents it wishes to dispose of to Seller at the expense of Seller. At the end of such sixty (60) day period, Buyer may, without liability to Seller, dispose of any such original documents which Seller has not informed Buyer in writing that it desires to recover.

 7.3  _Cooperation in Third-Party Litigation_. After the Closing, Buyer shall provide such cooperation as Seller or its counsel may reasonably request in connection with (a) any proceedings for which Buyer may be entitled to indemnification from Seller under Section 9.2 hereof; and (b) the Excluded Liabilities. Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited to: (i) making available at the reasonable request of Seller or its counsel and permitting Seller and its counsel, to make and retain copies of, any and all documents in the possession of or otherwise available to Buyer and allowing Seller to make inspections of the Real Property; (ii) making available upon the reasonable request of Seller or its counsel, employees and other persons within the control of or available to Buyer to consult with and assist Seller and its counsel and to prepare for and testify in connection with any proceedings, including depositions, trials and arbitration proceedings; and (iii) making available at the reasonable request of Seller or its counsel such other resources as may be within the control of or available to Buyer. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for Buyers reasonable, documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred (including such items as travel costs, and reasonable attorneys fees but not including any employee salaries or overhead) in connection with fulfilling its obligations under this Section 7.3. 

   

 7.4  _Racetrack Operator License_. (a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Buyer shall apply in writing with the CHRB for a racetrack operator license (the "Racetrack Operator License"), shall pay all required deposit fees pursuant to Section 19480 of the California Business and Professional Code and regulations issued by the Board, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue and obtain a Racetrack Operator License. Buyer shall file a Notice of Intention to file pursuant to Rule l431 of the CHRB at least 120 days prior to the 2005 Fall meet, and shall submit its application with respect thereto at least 90 days prior to the 2005 Fall meet. Buyer shall, subject to its right to give a Termination Notice under Section 7.4(b), maintain its Racetrack Operator License for three years immediately following the Closing Date. 

   

   (b)   If in any of the three years immediately following the Closing Date, (i) the  CHRB shall allocate to Hollywood Park a number of racing dates that is less than  the number of racing dates historically allocated to Hollywood Park and (ii)  Buyer determines that continued operation of the Racetrack Business would be  reasonably likely to result in Net Cash Flow of zero dollars or less during the  current or any following year, then Buyer may provide to Seller a written notice  of Buyers intent to terminate the Racetrack Business (a  "Termination Notice") and, unless Seller notifies Buyer within  fifteen (15) days that it disagrees with Buyers Termination Notice, may  terminate the Racetrack Business. If Seller disagrees with Buyers  Termination Notice, such dispute shall be resolved by any nationally recognized  accounting firm within thirty (30) days after Seller notifies Buyer that it  disagrees with Buyers Termination Certificate. Buyer shall provide any  financial information or other documentation reasonably requested by such  accounting firm and Buyer and Seller shall each pay 50% of the costs and  expenses of such accounting firm. The decision of such accounting firm shall be  final and binding upon Buyer and Seller.

   (c)   If, prior to the date that is three years after the Closing Date, Buyer  terminates the Racetrack Business for any reason other than as expressly  provided in Section 7.4(b), Buyer expressly and irrevocably acknowledges and  agrees that Seller would suffer a considerable loss and damages including,  without limitation, the loss of the benefit of the Reinvestment Agreement and  other consequential damages arising as a result of lost profits, which the  Seller and Buyer agree are and will continue to be extremely difficult to  ascertain with any degree of certainty. Accordingly, the parties agree that in  the event of such termination, Buyer shall pay to Seller the sum of fifteen  million dollars ($15,000,000) as liquidated damages in respect of such  termination of the Racetrack Business. Such amount shall be paid within ten (10)  days following such termination. Buyer expressly and irrevocably acknowledges  and agrees that such amount is fair and reasonable under the circumstances  existing as of the date hereof.

Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement  and the Transaction Documents, effective as of the Closing, in the absence of  fraud or willful misconduct on the part of either party in connection with the  negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the  Transactions contemplated hereby or by the Transaction Documents, Buyer, on  behalf of itself and each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, on the one hand, and  Seller on behalf of itself and each of the Seller Indemnified Parties, hereby  unconditionally and irrevocably waive any rights and claims any of them may have  against each other hereunder, whether at law or in equity, relating to the  Racetrack Business, the Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and/or the Transactions  contemplated hereby.

---|--- 
    
   

 9.3  _Conditions of Indemnification_. The respective obligations and liabilities of the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party under Section 9.2 shall be subject to the following terms and conditions: 

       | 9.3.1  _Notice_. Within thirty (30) days after receipt
of notice of commencement of any action or the assertion of any claim by a
third party or Governmental Authority (but in any event at least ten (10)
days preceding the date on which an answer or other pleading must be served
in order to prevent a judgment by default in favor of the party asserting the
claim), or notice of any other matter for which indemnification may be sought,
an Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party written notice thereof
together with a copy of any claim, process or other legal pleading and, in
the event the notice relates to any other matter, a reasonably detailed
description of the nature of such other matter, and the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to undertake the defense thereof by representatives of
its own choosing that are reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding the Indemnifying Partys undertaking of such defense,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to engage its own counsel, at its
own expense, and participate in the defense of the claim; provided, however,
that the Indemnifying Party shall retain the right in its sole and absolute
discretion to make all decisions with respect to the defense, settlement or
compromise of such claim, except as otherwise provided herein; provided that
the Indemnifying Party remains liable for any payments due under any such
settlement or compromise. The failure of the Indemnified Party to give notice
of any claim or other matter within the time period specified herein shall
not adversely affect the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification
hereunder except to the extent that such failure adversely affects the right
of the Indemnifying Party to assert any reasonable defense to such claim or
otherwise results in prejudices the Indemnifying Party.

     48  
  

* * *

  
  
  
         | 9.3.2  _Assumption of Defense_. If the
Indemnifying Party, by the fifteenth day after receipt of notice of any claim
or matter (or, pursuant to the parenthetical in Section 9.3.1, by the fifth
day preceding the day on which an answer or other pleading must be served in
order to prevent judgment by default in favor of the person asserting such
claim), does not elect to defend against such claim, the Indemnified
Party will (upon further notice to the Indemnifying Party) have the right to
undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim on behalf of
and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party (but only to the
extent of the indemnification obligation); provided, however, that the
Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise such claim without the
Indemnifying Partys consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. If after electing not to defend against such claim or
proceeding, the Indemnifying Party seeks to question the manner in which the
Indemnified Party defended such claim or proceeding or the amount of or
nature of any such settlement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the burden
to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the Indemnified Party did
not defend such claim or proceeding in a reasonably prudent manner.    
---|--- 
   
       | Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of any claim or
matter at any time prior to settlement, compromise or final
determination thereof if the Indemnifying Party provides assurances,
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, that the Indemnifying Party
will be financially able to satisfy such claim in full (to the extent of the
indemnification obligation) if such claim or proceeding is decided adversely.
The Indemnifying Party shall select counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of such claim or proceeding.    
---|--- 
   
       | If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any
claim or matter in accordance with this Section 9.3, the Indemnifying Party
shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any such claim or matter, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that:

 (i)   the Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of  such settlement or judgment, or shall obtain and deliver to such Indemnified  Party prior to the execution of a settlement a general release executed by the  claimant, which general release shall release the Indemnified Party from any  liability in such matter;

          |

 (ii)   the Indemnifying Party shall not be authorized to encumber any of the assets of  any Indemnified Party or to agree to any restriction that would apply to any  Indemnified Party or to its conduct of business; and

          |

 (iii)   a condition to any such settlement shall be a complete release of such  Indemnified Party with respect to such claim. 

  
---|--- 
    
       | If, in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the
Indemnified Party, there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may direct the defense
with respect to those issues as to which a conflict exists or potentially
exists at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense.

       | 9.3.3  _Claim Adverse to Indemnifying Party_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.3, if there is a
reasonable probability that a claim may materially adversely affect the
Indemnifying Party other than as a result of money damages or other money
payments, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its own cost and
expense, to compromise or settle such claim, but the Indemnifying Party shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or
compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the
plaintiff to the Indemnified Party a release from all liability in respect of
such claim.    
---|--- 
   
       | 9.3.4  _Cooperation_. In connection with any such
indemnification, the Indemnified Party will cooperate in all commercially
reasonable requests of the Indemnifying Party.

       | 9.3.5  _Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary elsewhere in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, no
party (or its Affiliates) shall, in any event, be liable to the other party
(or its Affiliates) for any consequential damages, including, but not limited
to, loss of revenue or income, cost of capital, or loss of
business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach
of this Agreement.    
---|--- 
   
       | 9.4  _Calculation of Losses_. The amount of any Losses
payable under Section 9.2 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any
amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party in respect of such Losses under
applicable insurance policies or from any other Person responsible therefor
(calculated after reduction for reasonable fees, expenses, and indirect costs
incurred in such recovery) (any such amounts shall be referred to herein
as "Other Source Payments"). If the Indemnified Party receives any
Other Source Payments subsequent to its receipt of an indemnification payment
by the Indemnifying Party hereunder, then such Indemnified Party shall
promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party making such indemnification payment
up to the amount of such Other Source Payments (to the extent attributable to
the Losses in question) actually received by the Indemnified Party. Nothing
in this section shall be construed or interpreted to mean that an Indemnified
Party must seek recovery for any Losses payable under Section 9.2 from
applicable or potentially applicable insurance policies or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible therefor, other than as set forth in this
Agreement.

# 10\. _TERMINATION_.

   

 This Agreement may be terminated:

   

 10.1  _Injunction_. By either Buyer or Seller if any court or Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in the United States shall have issued an order (other than a temporary restraining order), decree, judgment or ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Transactions and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and non-appealable. 

  

 10.2  _Mutual Agreement_. By mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller. 

  

   10.3 _Required Consents_. By failure to obtain any Required Consents as of the Closing Date, subject to Seller\'s right to a reasonable extension in order to obtain such Required Consents.

 10.6  _Uncured Asset Loss_. By Buyer, if any loss, damage, impairment, confiscation or condemnation of all or any portion of the Assets (each, an "Asset Loss") occurs with respect to an asset which is material to the Casino Building or an asset which is material to the operation of the Racetrack Business and such Asset Loss is not cured by Seller prior to the Closing Date (it being acknowledged that Seller shall not have any obligation to do so); provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (i) in the event such Asset Loss may be cured within 180 days, but may not be cured by Seller prior to the Closing Date despite the diligent undertakings of Seller to cure such Asset Loss prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall have the right to extend the Closing Date by such reasonable period of time as necessary to cure such Asset Loss prior to the Closing Date, provided that such time period shall not exceed 180 days from the date of the Asset Loss (the "Extended Closing Date"), by providing written notice of such election to Buyer and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, this Agreement may be terminated by Buyer pursuant to this Section 10.6 solely if such Asset Loss is not cured by Seller by such Extended Closing Date or (ii) Buyer shall have the right to elect to receive the net insurance proceeds attributable to such Asset Loss (if and to the extent that such Asset Loss was an insured loss) in lieu of Sellers cure of such Asset Loss prior to the Closing Date, in which event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.6. 

   

 10.7  _Effects of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 10, all obligations of the parties hereunder (except for those pursuant to Section 10 and Sections 6.3.3, 11.1, 13.2, 13.8, 13.9 and 13.10) shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party; provided, however, that no termination shall relieve any party from any liability arising from or relating to a material breach prior to termination. 

       |  IF THE SALE IS NOT CONSUMMATED DUE TO A MATERIAL BREACH BY
BUYER HEREUNDER, THEN SELLER SHALL  BE ENTITLED TO RETAIN THE DEPOSIT AS

AND RELEASE BUYER FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY HEREUNDER, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN
SECTIONS 10, AND SECTIONS 6.3.3, 11.1, 13.2, 13.8, 13.9 AND 13.10. THE
PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT SELLERS ACTUAL DAMAGES, IN THE EVENT OF A FAILURE
TO CONSUMMATE THIS SALE DUE TO BUYERS DEFAULT, WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT
OR IMPRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE. AFTER NEGOTIATION, THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED
THAT, CONSIDERING ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING ON THE DATE OF THIS
AGREEMENT, THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT IS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE DAMAGES
THAT  SELLER WOULD INCUR IN SUCH EVENT. BY PLACING THEIR INITIALS BELOW, EACH
PARTY SPECIFICALLY CONFIRMS THE ACCURACY OF THE STATEMENTS MADE ABOVE AND THE
FACT THAT EACH PARTY WAS REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL WHO EXPLAINED, AT THE TIME
THIS AGREEMENT WAS MADE, THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

# 11\. _OTHER COVENANTS_.

   

 11.1  _Announcements_. Each party agrees not to make, nor cause to be made, any news releases or other public announcements pertaining to the Transactions without first consulting the other party and attempting to formulate a mutually satisfactory arrangement for such disclosure, and in any case will make an announcement thereafter without the consent of the other only to the extent it believes in good faith that disclosure is required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any rules of or listing agreement with any national securities exchange or the NASDAQ National Market System. The commencement of litigation relating to this Agreement or any proceedings in connection therewith shall not be deemed a violation of this Section 11.1. 

   

 11.2  _Employment Matters_.

       | 11.2.1  _Offers of Employment_. Section 11.2.1 of the
Disclosure Schedule contains a list of each current Racetrack Employee.
Beginning on the date hereof and ending August 1, 2005, Seller agrees, upon
reasonable notice from Buyer, to allow Buyer to interview those Racetrack
Employees who are department heads and supervisors of department heads. Any
such interviews shall take place during ordinary business hours and shall be
conducted in compliance with applicable law. At the end of such period, Buyer
shall provide Seller with a list of the Racetrack Employees to whom it
intends to offer employment. Such offers of employment will be contingent
upon and effective on the Closing Date. Employees who accept such offers of
employment are referred to herein as "Hired Employees." Buyer agrees to pay
to those Hired Employees listed by name on Section 11.2.1 of the
Disclosure Schedule who remain continuously employed by Buyer on the third
anniversary of the Closing Date a retention bonus as set forth in such
section (the "Retention Bonus"). If within three years following the Closing
Date any Hired Employee listed on such schedule is (i) involuntarily
terminated by Buyer without cause (where "cause" means a willful breach or
neglect of a duty, breach of fiduciary duty, insubordination, theft, fraud,
dishonesty, malfeasance or misfeasance in performance of ones
duties, commission of a felony and/or the material disregard of the policies
or procedures of Buyer), (ii) involuntarily terminated by Buyer due to the
cessation of the Racetrack Business by Buyer, or (iii) constructively
terminated by Buyer (where "constructive termination" means a reduction in
base salary, annual bonus opportunity, rank, title, reporting requirements,
authority or duties from that in effect as of the date hereof (which such
action is not cured by Buyer within ten days of receipt of notice from
the employee to Buyer); a failure to pay amounts owed or benefits when due
(which failure is not cured by Buyer within ten days of receipt of notice
from the employee to Buyer); or a relocation of the primary place of
employment of more than 20 miles from the location as of the date hereof;
provided, however, that severance benefits for constructively terminated
employees are limited to just those employees designated as eligible on
Section 11.2.1 of the Disclosure Schedule), Buyer shall (x) pay the Retention
Bonus to such employee upon termination and (y) provide, through payment by
Buyer of all applicable COBRA premiums, such employee continued medical,
dental and vision coverage (as then in effect for active employees) for a
period of six months following termination of employment to the extent such
employee elects COBRA continuation coverage. Subject to the foregoing
obligations following the Closing, each full-time Hired Employee shall
be eligible to receive benefits under Employee Benefits Plans sponsored or
maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates, or to which Buyer or its Affiliates
contribute (and for the costs of which Seller shall not be responsible), on
the same basis as similarly situated employees of Buyer who are employed in
its racetrack business. To the extent any Hired Employee has accrued but
unpaid wages (including vacation entitlements) as of the Closing Date, Seller
shall pay to such Hired Employee any such amounts immediately prior to
the Closing Date. Seller shall also pay to each Hired Employee the pro-rata
portion of his or her annual bonus for the year in which the Closing occurs,
if any, on or about the date when any such bonus has ordinarily been paid.
Each full-time Hired Employees period of service and compensation history
with Seller or its Affiliates shall be counted in determining eligibility
for, and to the extent applicable, the amount and/or vesting of, vacation
benefits or any benefits or practice as to which period of service is a
factor, including benefits under each Employee Benefit Plan maintained or
sponsored by Buyer or its Affiliates, or to which Buyer or its Affiliates
contribute to the extent that such service was recognized under any analogous
plan of Seller or its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date. Each
full-time Hired Employee shall be covered as of his date of hire under any
Employee Benefit Plan maintained or sponsored by Buyer or its Affiliates, or
to which Buyer or its Affiliates contribute, providing health care
benefits (whether or not through insurance) without regard to any waiting
period or any condition or exclusion based on any pre-existing conditions,
medical history, claims experience, evidence of insurability, or genetic
factors (except to the extent such exclusions or conditions were applicable
under a corresponding Seller Employee Benefit Plan), and shall receive full
credit for any deductible payments made before the Closing Date, to
the extent that such expenses were incurred during a period in which such
employee was covered under a corresponding Seller Employee Benefit Plan. For
the avoidance of doubt, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not assume or have transferred to
them the sponsorship of any of the Seller Employee Benefit Plans or any other
benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates.

         | Seller shall cause the interests of Hired
Employees in the SunTrust Retirement Services 401(k) Investment Plan (the "HP
Plan") to become fully vested at the Closing Date and distributable
immediately thereafter. In the event a Hired Employee receives an "eligible
rollover distribution" (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the
Internal Revenue Code) from the HP Plan, if Buyer sponsors a tax-qualified
defined contribution plan ("Buyer Plan"), Buyer shall cause the Buyer Plan to
accept a direct rollover of such eligible rollover distribution (excluding
any portion of such eligible rollover distribution comprised of the
outstanding balance of a loan from the HP Plan to such Hired Employee).    
---|--- 
   
       | 11.2.2  _Retention of Liabilities_. Seller shall be
responsible for all liabilities, if any, resulting from Sellers termination
of any Racetrack Employee prior to or on the Closing Date, including, but not
limited to, (a) hospitalization or medical claims; (b) any claim asserting
the right to participate in any medical insurance program on a "self-pay"
basis under COBRA or any comparable state or local law; (c) any claims or
litigation resulting from such terminations and/or the sale of the Assets,
regardless of when such claims may be asserted and (d) any severance
payments or benefits. Notwithstanding any other Section of this Agreement,
Buyer shall be solely responsible for all liabilities, if any, under federal
and state WARN acts incurred in connection with the Transactions. Five
business days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide to Buyer a list
of all Racetrack Employees whose employment was terminated during the period
beginning on the date hereof and ending on the date such list is provided,
noting the date of termination for each employee and whether such
termination was voluntary or involuntary on the part of the employee.

         | 11.2.3  _Multiemployer Plans_. Seller may withdraw
from any of the Multiemployer Plans listed in Section 11.2.3 of the
Disclosure Schedule at the Closing Date. With respect to such Multiemployer
Plans listed on Section 11.2.3 of the Disclosure Schedule which Seller shall
not elect to so withdraw from (the "Surviving Plans"), Buyer and Seller shall
take all steps necessary under Section 4204 of ERISA so that the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement will not constitute a partial or
complete withdrawal under Section 4201 of ERISA. In addition, between the
date hereof and the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts so that the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
will not constitute a withdrawal under the California Race Track Pension
Plan. As required by Section 4204(a)(1)(C) of ERISA, the Seller agrees that
if Buyer withdraws in a complete withdrawal, or a partial withdrawal with
respect to operations, with respect to any of the Surviving Plans during the
first 5 plan years following the Closing Date, the Seller is secondarily
liable for any withdrawal liability it would have had to the applicable
Surviving Plans with respect to the operations if the liability of the Buyer
with respect to such Surviving Plan(s) is not paid. In addition, the Seller
agrees that if Buyer shall withdraw in a complete or partial withdrawal from
the California Race Track Pension Plan and/or any of the Surviving Plans due
to a cessation of the Racetrack Business on or before the last day of the
fifth plan year beginning immediately after the Closing, the Seller shall
indemnify and hold the Buyer harmless from and against any withdrawal
liability incurred by Buyer in connection with such complete or partial
withdrawal, provided that the aggregate amount of such withdrawal liability
indemnified hereunder by Seller shall not exceed the amount of the withdrawal
liability that would have been incurred by Seller if Seller had
completely withdrawn from the applicable plan or plans on the Closing Date
(the "Withdrawal Liability Cap"). The Withdrawal Liability Cap shall be
calculated in good faith in accordance with ERISA and agreed upon by Buyer
and Seller within ninety days following the Closing Date.

 11.3  _Cooperation_. Each party hereto agrees, both before and after the Closing, to execute any and all further documents and writings and to perform such other reasonable actions which may be or become necessary or expedient to effectuate and carry out the Transactions (which shall not include any obligation to make payments). 

   

 11.4  _Excluded Assets_. If, after the Closing Date, Excluded Assets, including, but not limited to, proprietary information of Seller, shall remain on the Real Property, then Buyer shall take reasonable efforts to deliver such Excluded Assets to Seller at the expense of Seller and, so long as such information shall remain on the Real Property, Buyer shall exercise the same reasonable degree of care with respect thereto as it does with respect to its own property.

 11.5  _Tax Cooperation_. After the Closing, the parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate with each other in the preparation of all tax returns and shall provide, or cause to be provided, to such other party any records and other information reasonably requested by such party in connection therewith as well as access to, and the cooperation of, the auditors of such other party and its Affiliates. After the Closing, the parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate with the other party in connection with any tax investigation, tax audit or other tax proceeding relating to the Racetrack Business or the Assets. Any information obtained pursuant to this Section relating to taxes shall be kept confidential by the other party. 

   

 11.6  _Racetrack Business_. Provided that either (i) the CHRB allocates to Hollywood Park Racetrack a number of racing dates for each of the three years immediately following the Closing Date that is not less than the number of racing dates historically allocated to Hollywood Park Racetrack or (ii) the board of directors of the Thoroughbred Owners of California provides to the CHRB written support for allocation of such number of racing dates to Hollywood Park Racetrack, then Buyer agrees to allocate at least five million dollars ($5,000,000) for certain capital improvements to the racing surfaces and the turf course of Hollywood Park Racetrack, including a new Polytrack racing surface and turf course repairs ("Track Improvements"). Buyer shall commence such Track Improvements no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days following the last day of the meet first occurring after the date that either of the events set forth in (i) or (ii) of this Section 11.6 shall have occurred (such 120-day period to be extended if and to the extent that Buyer is prevented from doing so as a result of events constituting force majeure or any other circumstances outside of Buyers control), and once such Track Improvements have commenced, they shall be completed as soon as reasonably practicable. The parties acknowledge and agree that if the Track Improvements are required hereunder and not completed in accordance herewith, Seller will suffer loss which is extremely difficult to ascertain. Accordingly the parties agree that in such event Buyer shall be required to pay to Seller as liquidated damages the amount that is the sum of five million dollars ($5,000,000) less the amount actually spent on such Track Improvements in immediately available funds. Buyer expressly and irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that such sum is fair and reasonable under the circumstances existing as of the date hereof 

   

 11.7  _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Each party will use commercially reasonable efforts (excluding the institution of litigation) to cause all conditions to its obligations hereunder to be timely satisfied and to perform and fulfill all obligations on its part to be performed and fulfilled under this Agreement to the end that the Transactions shall be effected substantially in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable. In addition, each party will use reasonable efforts to ensure that its representations and warranties remain true and correct in all respects as of the Closing Date. 

   

 11.8  _Removal of Signage and Logos_. Each party hereby acknowledges and agrees that Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to determine the best means of, and Buyer shall be responsible for, removing the various signs and logos of Seller from the personal property items described in Sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.10. 

   

 11.9  _Race Tickets_. Seller agrees that for as long as Seller shall continue to operate the Kentucky Derby, then (i) for as long as Buyer shall conduct race meets at Hollywood Park Racetrack, Buyer shall be entitled to purchase tickets to two (2) boxes (with 6 seats in each, for a total of 12 tickets) each year at the then current market rates, and (ii) for as long as Buyer shall conduct race meets at Bay Meadows Racetrack, Buyer shall be entitled to purchase tickets to one (1) box (with 6 seats) each year at the then current market rate. In addition, Seller agrees that for as long as Seller shall continue to operate the Kentucky Oaks, then (i) for as long as Buyer shall conduct race meets at Hollywood Park Racetrack, Buyer shall be entitled to purchase tickets to two (2) boxes (with 6 seats in each, for a total of 12 tickets) each year at the then current market rates, and (ii) for as long as Buyer shall conduct race meets at Bay Meadows Racetrack, Buyer shall be entitled to purchase tickets to one (1) box (with 6 seats) each year at the then current market rate to the Kentucky Oaks. The box seats for both such events shall be in locations at least as favorable as the locations provided for use by employees of Bay Meadows Racing Association and the Hollywood Park Racetrack at the 2005 Kentucky Derby. In addition, Seller shall to provide box one (1) box (with 6 seats) to both the Kentucky Derby and Kentucky Oaks (so long as Seller shall continue to operate same) to CAL National Bank as a sponsor in respect of the operations of the Hollywood Park Racetrack pursuant to that certain Sponsorship Agreement dated April 1, 2005 between Seller and CAL National Bank, so long as such sponsorship agreement shall be in effect. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy Buyers ticket purchase requests for any additional box seats as may be available for any of Sellers events, at the then current market rates and terms.

# 12\. _PHASE II ENVIRONMENTAL DILIGENCE PRIOR TO CLOSING_

   

 12.1  _Buyer Submission of Phase II Work Plan_. At Buyers option, but in any case prior to the execution of this Agreement, Buyer shall have provided to Seller and Seller shall have approved a work plan for any Phase II or other intrusive environmental testing Buyer deems necessary for purposes of evaluating the subsurface environmental or other Hazardous Substance conditions on, at, under, in or from the Real Property that may affect Buyers redevelopment plans (such testing, the "Phase II Testing"). Buyers work plan shall include (1) a detailed description of any proposed sampling of air, soil, soil gas, or groundwater that Buyer seeks to perform, including the location of any sampling and any proposed analytical methods to evaluate such samples, and (2) an explanation of the purpose for any such sampling and analyses. If such a work plan shall have been provided by Buyer and approved by Seller, it shall be attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit K_ and referred to herein as "Work Plan". 

          |

 (a)   After approval by Seller of the Work Plan (which shall occur prior to the date  hereof), Buyer or Buyers agents shall be given access to the Real Property  to undertake and complete its Phase II Testing (described in the Work Plan) and  its Phase II Report (as defined below). The Phase II Testing and Phase II Report  shall be completed by August 1, 2005 unless extended by the mutual agreement of  Buyer and Seller (the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on August  1, 2005 (or on such mutually agreed extended date) shall be referred to herein  as the "Phase II Period"). 

  
---|--- 
    
          |

 (b)   Seller or Sellers agents may observe and be present at the Real Property  when Buyer or Buyers agents perform the Phase II Testing. Seller shall  have the right to obtain split samples at Sellers own expense and at  Sellers sole discretion. Buyer shall contemporaneously provide to Seller,  copies of all final data, laboratory reports, or analytical results of its  sampling on the Real Property received by Buyer or Buyers agents pursuant  to this Section.

 (c)   Subject to Sellers approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,  Buyer and its authorized representatives shall have the right to modify the Work  Plan if, in the course of Buyers investigation, circumstances arise that  require a modification of the Work Plan in order to accurately evaluate the  environmental or other Hazardous Substance conditions on, at, under, in or from  the Real Property or Assets. This subsection shall not extend the time period in  which Buyer must complete all Phase II Testing, which shall not extend beyond  the Phase II Period. 

  
---|--- 
    
          |

 (d)   In the event that either Seller or Buyer discovers the presence of any Hazardous  Substance on, at, under, in or from the Real Property or in the groundwater  thereunder as a result of the Phase II Testing Buyer performs pursuant to this  Article 12 for which it concludes that any applicable federal, state or local  law, ordinance, regulation or rule governing the release of hazardous materials,  toxic chemicals, hazardous substances, hazardous waste, or waste into the soil  or groundwater, requires a report to be made to a Governmental Authority, then  Seller, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall determine whether any  reporting to a Governmental Authority is required, and if Seller determines the  same is required, Seller shall have the sole and exclusive right and  responsibility to do so. In the event Seller does report any or all of the  results of the Phase II Testing, Seller shall notify Buyer promptly of such  reporting and provide a copy of the public documents that Seller submits to a  Governmental Authority and all responses received from the applicable  Governmental Authority, if any. Nothing in this Section 12.1(d), however, shall  prevent Buyer or its authorized representatives from complying with any  independent reporting obligation to which they may be subject under any Law.

          |

 (e)   Upon the expiration of the Phase II Period, Buyer may elect to (i) waive its  rights under this Article 12 to seek a purchase price reduction; or  (ii) deliver to Seller a written estimate of the anticipated costs, if any,  to investigate or remediate environmental or Hazardous Substance conditions (in  air, soil, soil gas or groundwater) on, at, under, in or from the Real Property  in order to complete Buyers planned redevelopment of the Real Property  provided that those costs for redevelopment activities shall not include costs  for redevelopment activities unrelated to environmental contamination,  including, but not limited to, grading, compliance with the California  Environmental Quality Act, demolition, removal of any subsurface structures  (e.g. pipelines or tanks) or special handling for contaminated demolition debris  (e.g. asbestos, lead-based paint or contaminated concrete) (such written  estimate an "Environmental Remediation Cost Estimate") _;_   or (iii) terminate this Agreement and receive the full amount of the Deposit  from Seller, provided that Buyer shall not be permitted to terminate this  Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.1(e) unless the Final Environmental  Remediation Cost Estimate exceeds $20 million as determined either by Buyer and  Seller together or by LLF. In the event that Buyer prepares an Environmental  Remediation Cost Estimate, Buyer shall provide that estimate in writing to  Seller along with copies of all final data, laboratory reports or analytical  results of its sampling (unless already provided pursuant to Section 12.1(b))  and an explanation of how Buyer arrived at the estimate and why such costs are  necessary to bring the Real Property into compliance with all Environmental Laws  applicable to investigation and remediation of the Real Property if it were  redeveloped consistent with Buyers redevelopment plans ("Phase II  Report"). If, within ten business days following Sellers receipt  of the Environmental Remediation Cost Estimate submitted by Buyer, Seller does  not approve such estimate, Seller shall so notify Buyer in writing and either,  at Sellers option, (i) Seller shall terminate this Agreement, in  which case Buyer shall receive the full amount of the Deposit from Seller, or  (ii) the dispute resolution provisions of Section 12.3 below will be used  to reach an agreed upon Environmental Remediation Cost Estimate. If Seller does  approve Buyers Environmental Remediation Cost Estimate, Seller shall,  within ten business days following receipt of such estimate, so notify Buyer in  writing, such estimate shall be deemed a final Environmental Remediation Cost  Estimate (the "Final Remediation Cost Estimate") and Buyer and  Seller shall allocate the Final Remediation Cost Estimate as provided in Section  12.2 below, subject to Buyers right to terminate pursuant to Section  12.1(e).

 12.2  _Allocation of Remediation Costs_. If this Agreement is not terminated by either party under this Article 12 and a Final Remediation Cost Estimate is agreed upon, Buyer shall be obligated to absorb and pay for, with no adjustment in the Purchase Price, the first $2 million of remediation costs set forth in the Final Remediation Cost Estimate. If the Final Environmental Remediation Cost Estimate exceeds $2 million, Seller shall have the option of either (i) reducing the Purchase Price by the amount in the Final Environmental Remediation Cost Estimate that exceeds $2 million, or (2) terminating this Agreement, in which event Buyer shall receive a return of the Deposit and thereafter the parties shall have no further obligations to conclude the sale contemplated herein. 

   

 12.3  _Dispute Resolution_. If Buyer and Seller cannot agree on the Final Environmental Remediation Cost Estimate, and Seller elects not to terminate this Agreement, then Buyer and Seller shall follow the steps set forth in this Section 12.3. Buyer and Seller hereby agree that LLF (i) is a third party, neutral environmental consultant, (ii) has not been retained by either party or by either partys Affiliates during the three years prior to the Closing Date, other than for its services hereunder, (iii) has experience in remediation of real property in Southern California, (iv) is acceptable to both of them as the sole and final arbitrator for resolving any disputes regarding the Environmental Remediation Cost Estimate, and (v) that the parties shall equally share the cost of LLFs fees for work performed pursuant to this Section. LLF has agreed to serve in the capacity as a third party, neutral environmental consultant for purposes of this section. If within, five business days following Buyers receipt of Sellers written notification that Seller does not approve Buyers Environmental Remediation Cost Estimate (which written notification shall include Sellers Environmental Remediation Cost Estimate and an explanation of how Seller arrived at the estimate) and Buyer and Seller have failed to reach agreement on the Environmental Remediation Cost Estimate, then Buyer and Seller shall submit their respective Environmental Remediation Cost Estimates to LLF. LLF shall review both submissions and within five business days shall prepare a brief summary of its analysis of the cost estimates and its conclusion regarding the correct cost estimate to both Buyer and Seller. LLFs conclusion regarding the correct Environmental Remediation Cost Estimate shall be binding on both Buyer and Seller, and not subject to appeal or judicial review initiated by either Buyer or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates. Such conclusion of LLF shall be deemed a Final Remediation Cost Estimate and Buyer and Seller shall allocate the Final Remediation Cost Estimate as provided in Section 12.2 of this Agreement subject to Buyers and Sellers rights of termination under Section 12.1(e) and 12.2 herein, respectively.
