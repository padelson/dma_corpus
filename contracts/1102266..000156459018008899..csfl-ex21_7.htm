AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") is dated as of April 24,
2018, by and between CenterState Bank Corporation, a Florida corporation
("CenterState"), and Charter Financial Corporation, a Maryland corporation
("Charter" and, together with CenterState, the "Parties" and each a "Party").

 

W I T N E S S E T H

 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of the Parties have determined that it is in
the best interests of their respective companies and their respective
shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, to consummate the business
combination transaction provided for in this Agreement in which Charter will,
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge
with and into CenterState (the "Merger"), with CenterState as the surviving
company in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the
"Surviving Entity");

 

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of CenterState to enter into this
Agreement, all of the directors of Charter and CharterBank (as defined herein)
have entered into voting agreements (each a "Voting Agreement" and
collectively, the "Voting Agreements"), substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A, dated as of the date hereof, with CenterState, pursuant
to which each such director has agreed, among other things, to vote all of the
Charter Common Stock owned by such director in favor of the approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, subject to the terms of
the Voting Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger; and

 

WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Code"), and that this Agreement is intended to be
and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and
361 of the Code.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER

 

The Merger.

 

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with
the Florida Business Corporation Act (the "FBCA"), and the Maryland General
Corporation Law (the "MGCL") at the Effective Time, Charter shall merge with
and into CenterState pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan of Merger,
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B and made a part hereof
(the "Plan of Merger"). CenterState shall be the Surviving Entity in the
Merger and shall continue its existence as a corporation under the laws of the
State of Florida. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence
of Charter shall cease.

 

Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.

 

 At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of CenterState in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the articles of

   

incorporation of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in accordance
with applicable Law. The bylaws of CenterState in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Entity until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law and the terms of such
bylaws.

 

Bank Merger.

 

 Except as provided below, immediately following the Effective Time and
sequentially but in effect simultaneously on the Closing Date, CharterBank, a
federal savings and loan association and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of
Charter ("CharterBank"), shall be merged (the "Bank Merger") with and into
CenterState Bank, N.A., a national banking association and a direct wholly-
owned subsidiary of CenterState ("CenterState Bank"), in accordance with the
provisions of applicable federal banking laws and regulations, and CenterState
Bank shall be the surviving bank (the "Surviving Bank"). The Bank Merger
shall have the effects as set forth under applicable federal banking laws and
regulations, and the boards of directors of the Parties shall cause the board
of directors of CenterState Bank and CharterBank, respectively, to approve a
separate plan of merger and merger agreement (the "Bank Plan of Merger") in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C, and cause the Bank Plan
of Merger to be executed and delivered as soon as practicable following the
date of execution of this Agreement. Each of CenterState and Charter shall
also approve the Bank Plan of Merger in their capacities as sole shareholders
of CenterState Bank and CharterBank, respectively. As provided in the Bank
Plan of Merger, the Bank Merger may be abandoned at the election of
CenterState Bank at any time, whether before or after filings are made for
regulatory approval of the Bank Merger unless such abandonment would cause a
material delay in the receipt of the Regulatory Approvals, but if the Bank
Merger is abandoned for any reason, CharterBank shall continue to operate as a
wholly owned subsidiary of CenterState.

 

Directors and Officers.

 

The current directors and officers of CenterState shall, from and after the
Effective Time, continue as the directors and officers, respectively, of the
Surviving Entity until their successors shall have been duly elected,
appointed or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Entity.

 

Section 1.05.Effective Time; Closing.

 

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parties will
make all such filings as may be required to consummate the Merger and the Bank
Merger under applicable Law. The Merger shall become effective as set forth
in the articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") related to the Merger,
which will include the Plan of Merger, that shall be filed with the Department
of State of the State of Florida, as provided in the FBCA, on the Closing
Date, and with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation, as
provided in the MGCL. The "Effective Time" of the Merger shall be the later
of (i) the date and time of filing of the Articles of Merger, or (ii) the date
and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Articles of
Merger, which shall be no later than five (5) Business Days after all of the
conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VI (other than conditions to be
satisfied at the Closing, which shall be satisfied or waived at the Closing)
have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof or such
later date as the Parties may agree; provided that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Parties agree, if requested by CenterState, that the Effective
Time shall occur on the first day of the month that begins after such fifth
(5th) Business Day.

 

(b)The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall take place on a date and time which shall be at or
immediately prior to the Effective Time (such date, the "Closing Date") at the
offices of CenterState, or such other place as the Parties may mutually agree.
At or prior to the Closing, there shall be delivered by CenterState and
Charter the Articles of Merger and such other certificates and other documents
required to be delivered under Article VI.

   

Additional Actions.

 

 If, at any time after the Effective Time, CenterState shall consider or be
advised that any further deeds, documents, assignments or assurances in Law or
any other acts are necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, Charter and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers and
directors shall be deemed to have granted to CenterState and its Subsidiaries,
and each or any of them, an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and
deliver, in such official corporate capacities, all such deeds, assignments or
assurances in Law or any other acts as are necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement, and the officers and directors of CenterState
and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, are authorized in the name of Charter and
its Subsidiaries or otherwise to take any and all such action.

 

Reservation of Right to Revise Structure.

 

 CenterState may at any time and without the approval of Charter change the
method of effecting the business combination contemplated by this Agreement if
and to the extent that it reasonably deems such a change to be desirable;
provided, however, that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or
kind of the consideration to be issued to (x) Holders of Charter Common Stock
as Merger Consideration or (y) holders of Charter Stock Options, each as
currently contemplated in this Agreement, (ii) reasonably be expected to
materially impede or delay consummation of the Merger, (iii) adversely affect
the federal income tax treatment of Holders of Charter Common Stock in
connection with the Merger or adversely limit or impact the qualification of
the Merger as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the
Code, or (iv) require submission to or approval of Charter's stockholders
after this Agreement has been approved by Charter's stockholders. In the event
that CenterState elects to make such a change, the Parties agree to cooperate
to execute appropriate documents to reflect the change.

 

ARTICLE II 

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 

Merger Consideration.

 

 Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the Parties or any stockholder of Charter:

 

(a)Each share of CenterState Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following the
Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

 

(b)Each share of Charter Common Stock owned directly by CenterState, Charter
or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than shares in trust accounts,
managed accounts and the like for the benefit of customers or shares held as
collateral for outstanding debt previously contracted) immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and each share of Charter Common Stock that is remitted to
Charter immediately prior to the Effective Time for purposes of repayment of
the ESOP loan balance as contemplated by Section 5.11(h) shall be cancelled
and retired at the Effective Time without any conversion thereof, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 

(c)Each share of Charter Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares described in Section 2.01(b)), shall
be converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II,
into the right to receive (i) 0.738 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of
CenterState Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration") and (ii) $2.30 in cash,
without interest (the "Cash Consideration" and, together with the Stock
Consideration, the "Merger Consideration") (provided that cash will be paid in
lieu of fractional shares as specified in Section 2.04.)

   

Section 2.02.Stock-Based Awards.

 

(a)At the Effective Time, all Rights with respect to Charter Common Stock
pursuant to stock options granted by Charter (the "Charter Stock Options")
which are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
exercisable, shall be converted at the Effective Time into an obligation of
the Surviving Entity to pay (or cause to be paid) and a right of the
applicable Charter Stock Option holder to receive, in full satisfaction of any
Rights in respect of the Charter Stock Options, a cash payment equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Charter Common
Stock underlying such Person's Charter Stock Options by (ii) $23.00 minus the
exercise price per share under such Charter Stock Options (the "Charter Stock
Option Price"), subject to any income or employment tax withholding required
under the Code or any provision of applicable Law. The Surviving Entity shall
pay the Charter Stock Option Price owed to each holder of Charter Stock
Options outstanding as of the Effective Time within ten (10) Business Days of
the Effective Time (provided that Charter has timely provided to CenterState
the information needed by CenterState to process payment within such period).

 

(b)Charter shall take all requisite action so that, as of the Effective Time,
all Charter Stock Options and any other Rights, contingent or accrued, to
acquire or receive Charter Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of
such shares, and each award of any kind consisting of Charter Common Stock
that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under
the Charter Stock Plans, or otherwise, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be, terminated and
cancelled as of the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, such
Charter Stock Options shall represent only the right to receive the payment
specified in Section 2.02(a).

 

(c)Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of restricted
stock of Charter outstanding immediately prior thereto (the "Charter
Restricted Stock") shall become fully vested and the restrictions thereon
shall lapse, and shall be treated as issued and outstanding shares of Charter
Common Stock for the purposes of this Agreement, including but not limited to
representing the right to receive the Merger Consideration, less any income or
employment tax withholding required under the Code or any provision of
applicable Law, in Section 2.01.

 

(d)Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of Charter (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Charter Stock Plans)
shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions, including obtaining
any necessary consents or amendments to the applicable award agreements and
equity plans, as may be required to effectuate the provisions of this Section
2.02. 

 

Rights as Stockholders; Stock Transfers.

 

 Prior to the Effective Time, Charter shall continue to maintain its stock
transfer records and to transfer and replace Certificates in accordance with
its existing policies and past practices with regard to such transfers and
replacements. At the Effective Time, all shares of Charter Common Stock, when
converted in accordance with Section 2.01, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each Certificate or Book-Entry Share previously evidencing such shares shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive for each such share of Charter
Common Stock, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of CenterState Common Stock in accordance with this Article II. At the
Effective Time, Holders of Charter Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall
have no rights as, stockholders of Charter, other than the right to receive
the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of CenterState
Common Stock as provided under this Article II. After the Effective Time,
there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
Charter of shares of Charter Common Stock.

 

Fractional Shares.

 

 Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no fractional shares of
CenterState Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor, or other
evidence of ownership

   

thereof, will be issued in the Merger. In lieu thereof, CenterState shall pay
or cause to be paid to each holder of a fractional share of CenterState Common
Stock, rounded to the nearest one hundredth of a share, an amount of cash
(without interest and rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by
multiplying the fractional share interest in CenterState Common Stock to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled by the CenterState Average Stock
Price.

 

Plan of Reorganization.

 

 It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement shall constitute
a "plan of reorganization" as that term is used in Sections 354 and 361 of the
Code. 

 

Exchange Procedures.

 

 As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later
than five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, and provided that Charter
has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent all
information that is necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its
obligations as specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall mail or otherwise
cause to be delivered to each Holder appropriate and customary transmittal
materials, in a form satisfactory to CenterState and Charter, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, as well as
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares as specified in Section 2.04) (the "Letter of Transmittal").

 

Section 2.07.Deposit of Merger Consideration.

 

(a)Prior to the Effective Time, CenterState shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (A) the number of shares of CenterState
Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.01(c) in book-entry form equal to
the aggregate CenterState Common Stock portion of the Merger Consideration
(excluding any fractional shares), and (B) cash in an amount sufficient to pay
(1) the Cash Consideration and (2) to the extent then determinable, any cash
payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.04 (collectively,
the "Exchange Fund").

 

(b)Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders
of Charter for one (1) year after the Effective Time (as well as any interest
or proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange
Agent to CenterState. Any stockholders of Charter who have not theretofore
complied with this Section 2.07 and Section 2.08(a) shall thereafter look only
to CenterState for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of CenterState Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor, and any dividends or distributions to which such Holder shall have
become entitled to pursuant to Section 2.08(b) deliverable in respect of each
share of Charter Common Stock such stockholder held as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case
without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for shares of Charter Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them
is not claimed prior to the date on which such shares of CenterState Common
Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent
permitted by the law of abandoned property and any other applicable Law,
become the property of CenterState (and to the extent not in its possession
shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor
any Party shall be liable to any Holder represented by any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration (or any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. CenterState and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of
Charter to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be
conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to
ownership of any shares of Charter Common

   

Stock represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Share, CenterState and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to tender to the custody of any court of
competent jurisdiction any Merger Consideration represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share and file legal proceedings interpleading all
parties to such dispute, and will thereafter be relieved with respect to any
claims thereto.

 

Section 2.08.Delivery of Merger Consideration.

 

(a)Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Share(s), accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a Holder
will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) book-
entry shares representing that number of whole shares of CenterState Common
Stock to which such Holder shall have become entitled pursuant to Section
2.01(c) (excluding any fractional share) and (ii) cash in an amount equal to
(A) the Cash Consideration to which such Holder shall have become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.01(c), (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
CenterState Common Stock which such Holder shall have become entitled pursuant
to Section 2.04, and (C) any dividends or distributions to which such Holder
shall have become entitled pursuant to Section 2.08(b). CenterState shall
direct the Exchange Agent to provide to each such Holder of Charter Common
Stock (x) the applicable Merger Consideration, (y) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.04, and
(z) and any dividends or distributions to which such Holder shall have become
entitled to pursuant to Section 2.08(b) promptly, which shall be no later than
five (5) Business Days upon receipt of a Holder's Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares and a completed Letter of Transmittal. The Exchange Agent and
CenterState, as the case may be, shall not be obligated to deliver cash and/or
shares of CenterState Common Stock to a Holder to which such Holder would
otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger until such Holder surrenders
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing the shares of Charter
Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Article II, or, an appropriate
affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in such amount as may
be reasonably required in each case by CenterState or the Exchange Agent. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing Charter
Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of Charter,
the proper amount of the Merger Consideration shall be paid or issued in
exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly
representing such Charter Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment or
issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of
the payment or issuance to a Person other than the registered Holder of the
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of CenterState that the Tax has
been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(b)All shares of CenterState Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger
shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and if ever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by CenterState in respect of the
CenterState Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares of CenterState Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of
the CenterState Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share until such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the
effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of CenterState Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of CenterState Common
Stock and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of CenterState
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment
date subsequent to surrender.

 



   

(c)CenterState (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Holder such amounts as CenterState is required to deduct and
withhold under applicable Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority and upon such remittance
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
CenterState or the Exchange Agent, as applicable.

 

Anti-Dilution Provisions.

 

 If the number of shares of CenterState Common Stock or Charter Common Stock
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time shall be increased or
decreased, or changed into or exchanged for a different number of kind of
shares or securities, in any such case as a result of a stock split, reverse
stock split, stock combination, stock dividend, recapitalization,
reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction, or there shall be any
extraordinary dividend or distribution with respect to such stock, and the
record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration to give
Holders of Charter Common Stock the same economic effects as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event.

 

ARTICLE III 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CHARTER

 

Section 3.01.Making of Representations and Warranties.

 

Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Charter to
CenterState concurrently herewith (the "Charter Disclosure Schedule"); Charter
hereby represents and warrants to CenterState that the statements contained in
this Article III are correct as of the date of this Agreement and will be
correct as of the Closing Date (as though made on and as of the Closing Date),
except as to any representation or warranty which specifically speaks as of an
earlier date (including without limitation representations made as of "the
date hereof"), which only need be correct as of such earlier date.
"Knowledge" or "knowledge" as to Charter and any other phrase of similar
import means, with respect to any matter in question relating to Charter, of
those individuals set forth in Charter Disclosure Schedule Section 3.01(a).
Charter has made a good faith effort to ensure that the disclosure on each
schedule of the Charter Disclosure Schedule corresponds to the section
referenced herein. However, for purposes of the Charter Disclosure Schedule,
any item disclosed on any schedule therein or disclosed in the Charter SEC
Reports is deemed to be fully disclosed with respect to all sections of this
Agreement under which such item may be relevant as and to the extent that it
is reasonably clear on the face of such schedule or such Charter SEC Reports
that such item applies to such other section of this Agreement. 

 

Section 3.02.Organization, Standing and Authority.

 

(a)Charter is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Maryland and is a savings and loan
holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners' Loan Act, as amended.
Charter has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Charter is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Charter. Charter
Disclosure Schedule Section 3.02(a) sets forth a complete and accurate list of
all such jurisdictions. True and complete copies of the Articles of
Incorporation of Charter (the "Charter

   

Articles") and the Bylaws of Charter (the "Charter Bylaws"), as in effect as
of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available by Charter
to CenterState.

 

(b)CharterBank is Charter's sole Subsidiary and (i) is duly organized and
validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is
duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under
applicable Law, in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state,
local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of
its business requires it to be so qualified, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not reasonably be likely, either individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Charter and (iii) has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. There are no
restrictions on the ability of CharterBank to pay dividends or distributions
except for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to
all federally chartered savings institutions. The deposit accounts of
CharterBank are insured by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund (as
defined in Section 3(y) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950, as
amended) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, all premiums and assessments
required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when due, and no
proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or, to Charter's
knowledge, threatened. There is no Person whose results of operations, cash
flows, changes in shareholders' equity or financial position are consolidated
in the financial statements of Charter other than CharterBank.

 

Section 3.03.Capitalization.

 

(a)The authorized capital stock of Charter consists of 100,000,000 shares of
Charter Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value
per share, of which no shares of preferred stock are issued or outstanding. As
of the date of this Agreement, no shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of Charter are issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding, other
than (i) 15,137,631 shares of Charter Common Stock issued and outstanding, and
(ii) 1,536,522 shares of Charter Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of outstanding Charter Stock Options (of which, a total of 1,000,044
are held by Charter executive officers, each of whom has entered into a Stock
Option Lock-Up Agreement). Charter has 84,732 shares of outstanding Charter
restricted stock awards, all of which are included in the Charter Common Stock
issued and outstanding shares in Section 3.03(a)(i). All of the issued and
outstanding shares of Charter Common Stock have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No
bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have the right to vote on
any matters on which stockholders of Charter may vote are issued or
outstanding. There are no contractual obligations of Charter or CharterBank
pursuant to which Charter or CharterBank could be required to register shares
of capital stock or other securities of Charter or CharterBank under the
Securities Act. Except as set forth in Charter Disclosure Schedule Section
3.03(a), as of the date of this Agreement, no trust preferred or subordinated
debt securities of Charter are issued or outstanding. Other than the Charter
Equity Awards issued prior to the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, rights,
exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or agreements
obligating Charter to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any shares of Charter Common Stock or any other equity interests of
Charter. No holder of capital stock of Charter will have dissenters' rights
with respect to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b)There are no voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or other
agreements in effect pursuant to which Charter or CharterBank has a
contractual or other obligation with respect to the voting or transfer of the
Charter Common Stock or other equity interests of Charter.

   

(c)Charter Disclosure Schedule Section 3.03(c) sets forth a true, correct and
complete list of all Charter Equity Awards outstanding as of the date hereof,
specifying, on a holder-by-holder basis, (i) the name of each holder of such
Charter Equity Award, (ii) the number of shares subject to each such Charter
Equity Award, (iii) the grant date of each such Charter Equity Award, (iv) the
Charter Stock Plan under which such Charter Equity Award was granted, (v) the
exercise price for each such Charter Equity Award that is a Charter Stock
Option, (vi) the expiration date of each such Charter Equity Award that is a
Charter Stock Option, and (vii) the terms of each Charter Equity Award that is
a Charter restricted stock award. Other than the Charter Equity Awards, no
equity-based awards (including any cash awards where the amount of payment is
determined in whole or in part based on the price of any capital stock of
Charter or CharterBank) are outstanding.

 

(d)Charter owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of CharterBank,
free and clear of Liens, and all of such shares or equity ownership interests
are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable
(except, with respect to CharterBank, as provided under 12 U.S.C. § 55 or any
comparable provision of applicable state law) and free of preemptive rights,
with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. CharterBank has
no or is not bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
rights, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of
CharterBank or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of
CharterBank.

 

Section 3.04.Authority; No Violation.

 

(a)Charter has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of Charter. The
Board of Directors of Charter has determined that the Merger, on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, is in the best interests of Charter
and has directed that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
be submitted to Charter's stockholders for approval at a meeting of such
stockholders and has adopted a resolution to the foregoing effect. Except for
the Requisite Charter Stockholder Approval and the adoption and approval of
the Bank Merger Agreement by the board of directors of CharterBank and Charter
as its sole shareholder, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Charter
are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Charter and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
by CenterState) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Charter,
enforceable against Charter in accordance with its terms (except in all cases
as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting insured depository institutions or the rights of
creditors generally and subject to general principles of equity (the
"Enforceability Exceptions")).

 

(b)Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Charter nor the
consummation by Charter of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by Charter with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i)
violate any provision of the Charter Articles or the Charter Bylaws or (ii)
assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in Section 3.05
are duly obtained and/or made, (x) violate any Law, statute, code, ordinance,
rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction applicable to
Charter or CharterBank or any of their respective properties or assets,
including but not limited to, 12 C.F.R. 239.63(f), or (y) violate, conflict
with, result in a breach of any provision of or the loss of any benefit under,
constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a
right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective
properties or assets of Charter or CharterBank under, any of the terms,
conditions or

   

provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Charter or
CharterBank is a party, or by which they or any of their respective properties
or assets may be bound, except (in the case of clause (ii) above) for such
violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations or creations which, either individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Charter.

 

Consents and Approvals.

 

Except for (a) the filing of applications, filings and notices, as applicable,
with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal
Reserve Board") under the BHC Act and the Home Owners' Loan Act and approval
of such applications, filings and notices, (b) the filing of applications,
filings and notices, as applicable, with the OCC in connection with the Bank
Merger, under the Bank Merger Act, and approval of such applications, filings
and notices, (c) the filing of any required applications, filings or notices,
as applicable, with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") and
the approval of such applications, filings and notices, (d) the filing with
the SEC of a proxy statement in definitive form relating to the meeting of
Charter's stockholders to be held in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any amendments or supplements
thereto, the "Proxy Statement-Prospectus"), and of the Registration Statement
in which the Proxy Statement-Prospectus will be included as a prospectus, to
be filed with the SEC by CenterState in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and declaration of effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, (e) the filing of the Certificates/Articles of Merger
with the Florida Secretary of State pursuant to the FBCA and the Maryland
State Department of Assessments and Taxation pursuant to the MGCL to the
extent required, and (f) such filings and approvals as are required to be made
or obtained under the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of various states in
connection with the issuance of the shares of CenterState Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement (the "Regulatory Approvals"), no consents or
approvals of or filings or registrations with any Governmental Authority are
necessary in connection with (i) the execution and delivery by Charter of this
Agreement or (ii) the consummation by Charter of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (including the consummation by CharterBank of
the Bank Merger). As of the date hereof, Charter is not aware of any reason
why the necessary Regulatory Approvals and consents will not be received in
order to permit consummation of the Merger and Bank Merger on a timely basis.

 

Section 3.06.Reports.

 

(a)Charter and CharterBank have timely filed (or furnished, as applicable) all
reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments required
to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file (or furnish,
as applicable) since January 1, 2016 with (i) any state regulatory authority,
(ii) the SEC, (iii) the Federal Reserve Board, (iv) the FDIC, and (v) the OCC
(each a "Regulatory Agency" and collectively, the "Regulatory Agencies"),
including any report, registration or statement required to be filed (or
furnished, as applicable) pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations of the
United States, any state, or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the failure
to file such report, registration or statement or to pay such fees and
assessments, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Charter or CharterBank, as the
case may be. Except for examinations of Charter and CharterBank conducted by
a Regulatory Agency in the Ordinary Course of Business, no Regulatory Agency
has initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of Charter,
investigation into the business or operations of Charter or CharterBank since
January 1, 2016, except where such proceedings or investigation would not
reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Charter or CharterBank. There is no unresolved
violation, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to
any report or statement relating to any examinations or inspections of Charter
or CharterBank, which would reasonably be likely to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Charter.

   

(b)An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by Charter or CharterBank pursuant to the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2016 (the "Charter
SEC Reports") is publicly available. No such Charter SEC Report, at the time
filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of registration statements
and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the
relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that information
filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement)
shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of their
respective dates, all Charter SEC Reports filed or furnished under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of Charter has
failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her under
Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or material unresolved
issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Charter SEC Reports.

 

Section 3.07.Financial Statements.

 

(a)The financial statements of Charter and CharterBank included (or
incorporated by reference) in Charter SEC Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of Charter and CharterBank, (ii) fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows,
changes in shareholders' equity and consolidated financial position of Charter
and CharterBank for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective
dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-
end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of
their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except,
in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The
books and records of Charter and CharterBank have been, since January 1, 2016,
and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and
any other applicable legal and accounting requirements. Dixon Hughes Goodman
LLP has not resigned (or informed Charter that it intends to resign) or been
dismissed as independent public accountants of Charter as a result of or in
connection with any disagreements with Charter on a matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure.

 

(b)Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Charter, neither Charter nor
CharterBank has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except,
(i) with respect to Charter and CharterBank, for those liabilities that are
reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Charter
included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended
December 31, 2017 (including any notes thereto), (ii) for liabilities incurred
in the Ordinary Course of Business consistent with past practice since
December 31, 2017, or (iii) in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c)The records, systems, controls, data and information of Charter and
CharterBank are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Charter or CharterBank or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Charter. Charter (i) has

   

implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to Charter, including CharterBank, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of Charter by others within
those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Charter's outside
auditors and the audit committee of the Charter Board of Directors (x) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Charter's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and
(y) to the knowledge of Charter, any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Charter's internal controls over financial reporting (copies of such items in
subsections (x) and (y) have previously been made available by Charter to
CenterState). To the knowledge of Charter, there is no reason to believe that
Charter's chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able
to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 

(d)Since January 1, 2016, (i) neither Charter nor CharterBank, nor, to the
knowledge of Charter, any director, executive officer, auditor, accountant or
representative of Charter or CharterBank, has received or otherwise had or
obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim,
whether written or, to the knowledge of Charter, oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods
(including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and
accruals) of Charter or CharterBank or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or written
claim that Charter or CharterBank has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Charter or CharterBank,
whether or not employed by Charter or CharterBank, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by Charter or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to
the Board of Directors of Charter or any committee thereof or to the knowledge
of Charter, to any director or officer of Charter.

 

Section 3.08.Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

 

(a)Since September 30, 2017, no event or events have occurred that have had or
would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Charter.

 

(b)Since September 30, 2017, except with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby or as required or permitted by this Agreement, Charter and
CharterBank have carried on their respective businesses in all material
respects in the ordinary course.

 

Section 3.09.Legal Proceedings.

 

(a)Neither Charter nor CharterBank is a party to any, and there are no pending
or, to Charter's knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or
other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory
investigations of any nature against Charter or CharterBank or, to Charter's
knowledge, any of their current or former directors or executive officers (i)
that would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Charter or CharterBank, or (ii)
reasonably likely to prevent, materially impede or materially delay its
ability to perform its covenants and agreements under this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

   

(b)There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction
imposed upon Charter, CharterBank or the assets of Charter or CharterBank (or

Charter and CharterBank has duly and timely filed (taking into account all
applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all jurisdictions in which
Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true,

CharterBank is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file
any material Tax Return. All material Taxes of Charter and CharterBank that

withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid
in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor,
stockholder, independent contractor or other third party. Neither Charter nor
CharterBank has granted any extension or waiver of the limitation period
applicable to any material Tax that remains in effect. The federal income Tax

assets of Charter and CharterBank. In the last six (6) years, neither Charter
nor CharterBank has been informed in writing by any jurisdiction that the
jurisdiction believes that Charter or CharterBank was required to file any Tax
Return that was not filed. Charter has made available to CenterState true,
correct, and complete copies of any private letter ruling requests, closing
agreements or gain recognition agreements with respect to Taxes requested or
executed in the last six (6) years. There are no Liens for material Taxes
(except Taxes not yet due and payable or for Taxes that are being contested in
good faith) on any of the assets of Charter or CharterBank. Neither Charter
nor CharterBank is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or
indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or
arrangement exclusively between or among Charter and CharterBank). Neither
Charter nor CharterBank (i) has been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent
of which was Charter) or (ii) has any liability for the Taxes of any Person
(other than Charter or CharterBank) under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither Charter nor
CharterBank has been, within the past two (2) years or otherwise as part of a

tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. Neither Charter nor
CharterBank has participated in a "listed transaction" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2). At no time during the past five

within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code. Neither Charter nor
CharterBank will be required to include any material item of income in, or to

required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully
reflected on the books and records of Charter, as applicable, except as,

arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and, (b) to Charter's
knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that may reasonably be expected to
give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against Charter Benefit Plans, any
fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Charter Benefit Plans
or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Charter Benefit Plans.

 

(j)None of Charter, CharterBank or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates
has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the

Plans or their related trusts, Charter, CharterBank or any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates to any material unpaid Tax or material penalty imposed under
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

 

(k)Except as provided in Charter Disclosure Schedule Section 3.11(k), neither
the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby may (either alone or in conjunction with any
other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery of,
cause Charter or CharterBank to transfer or set aside any assets to fund any
benefits under any Charter Benefit Plan, or increase in the amount or value
of, any payment, right or other benefit to any employee, officer, director or
other service provider of Charter or CharterBank. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, except as provided in Charter Disclosure Schedule
Section 3.11(k), no amount paid or

   

payable (whether in cash, in property or in the form of benefits) by Charter
or CharterBank in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either
solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction
with any other event) may be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code.

held, all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the
lawful conduct of their respective businesses and ownership of their
respective properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have
paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except
where neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and
holding such license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to
pay any fees or assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Charter, and to the
knowledge of Charter, no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary
license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. Charter and
CharterBank have complied in all material respects with and are not in

Agency relating to the origination, sale or servicing of mortgage or consumer
Loans.

 

(h)As to each Loan that is secured whether in whole or in part, by a guaranty
of the United States Small Business Administration or any other Governmental
Authority, such guaranty is in full force and effect, and to Charter's

ownership claims with respect to such BOLI or proceeds of insurance derived
therefrom and, except as disclosed in Charter Disclosure Schedule Section
3.27(b), there is no split dollar or similar benefit under Charter's BOLI.
Neither Charter nor CharterBank has any outstanding borrowings secured in
whole or in part by its BOLI.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CENTERSTATE

 

Section 4.01.Making of Representations and Warranties.

 

CenterState hereby represents and warrants to Charter that the statements
contained in this Article IV are correct as of the date of this Agreement and
will be correct as of the Closing Date (as though made on and as of the
Closing Date), except as to any representation or warranty which specifically
speaks as of an earlier date (including without limitation representations
made as of "the date hereof"), which only need be correct as of such earlier
date. "Knowledge" or "knowledge" as to CenterState and any other phrase of
similar import means, with respect to any matter in question relating to
CenterState, of the President, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief
Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Risk Officer, the
Chief Credit Officer, and the Chief Administrative Officer of CenterState. Any
item disclosed in the CenterState SEC Reports is deemed to be fully disclosed
with respect to all sections of this Agreement under which such item may be
relevant as and to the extent that it is reasonably clear on the face of such
CenterState SEC Reports that such item applies to such section of this
Agreement. 

 

Section 4.02.Organization, Standing and Authority.

 

(a)CenterState is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Florida and is a bank holding company
duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended ("BHC
Act") that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company under the
BHC Act. CenterState has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all
of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. CenterState is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on CenterState. True
and complete copies of the CenterState Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws,
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made
available by CenterState to Charter.

 

(b)Each Subsidiary of CenterState (a "CenterState Subsidiary") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable Law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified, except
where the failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be likely, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on
CenterState and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own
or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of
CenterState to pay dividends or distributions except under applicable state
law or, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for
restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to all such
regulated

   

entities. The deposit accounts of CenterState Bank are insured by the FDIC
through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by Law, all
premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been
paid when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are
pending or, to CenterState's knowledge, threatened.

(a)The authorized capital stock of CenterState consists of 100,000,000 shares
of CenterState Common Stock, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of

debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have the right to vote on any
matters on which shareholders of CenterState may vote are issued or

date of this Agreement, no trust preferred or subordinated debt securities of
CenterState are issued or outstanding. Other than equity awards granted under
a CenterState stock plan, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other
commitments or agreements obligating CenterState to issue, transfer, sell,

personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No CenterState
Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character calling
for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other
equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of such Subsidiary.

 

Section 4.04.Authority; No Violation.

 

(a)CenterState has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly and validly approved by the board of directors of CenterState.
The board of directors of CenterState has determined that the Merger, on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, is in the best interests of
CenterState and its shareholders. Except

   

for the adoption of the Bank Merger Agreement by the board of directors of
CenterState Bank and CenterState as its sole shareholder, no other corporate
proceedings on the part of CenterState are necessary to approve this Agreement
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by CenterState and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Charter) constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of CenterState, enforceable against CenterState in
accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be
limited by the Enforceability Exceptions).

 

(b)Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by CenterState, nor
the consummation by CenterState of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by CenterState with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i)
violate any provision of the CenterState Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws,
or (ii) assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in
Section 4.05 are duly obtained and/or made, (x) violate any law, statute,
code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction
applicable to CenterState, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets or (y) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of any
provision of or the loss of any benefit under, constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or
cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of
CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which CenterState or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of clause (ii) above)
for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations,
cancellations, accelerations or creations which either individually or in the
aggregate would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
CenterState.

 

Consents and Approvals.

 

Except for: (a) the filing of applications, filings and notices, as
applicable, with the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act and the Home
Owners' Loan Act and approval of such applications, filings and notices; (b)
the filing of applications, filings and notices, as applicable, with the OCC
in connection with the Bank Merger, under the Bank Merger Act, and approval of

Agreement or (B) the consummation by CenterState of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (including the consummation by CenterState
Bank of the Bank Merger). As of the date hereof, CenterState is not aware of
any reason why the necessary Regulatory Approvals and consents will not be

timely basis.

 

Section 4.06.Reports.

 

(a)CenterState and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed (or furnished,
as applicable), all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required
to file (or furnish, as applicable) since January 1, 2016 with any Regulatory
Agencies, including any report, registration or statement required to be filed
(or furnished, as applicable) pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations of
the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or

   

any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable
in connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report,
registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on CenterState and its Subsidiaries. Except for
examinations of CenterState and its Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory
Agency in the Ordinary Course of Business, no Regulatory Agency has initiated
or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of CenterState,
investigation into the business or operations of CenterState or any of its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2016, except where such proceedings or
investigation would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on CenterState. There is no
unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with
respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations or inspections
of CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries, which would reasonably be likely to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
CenterState.

 

(b)An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2016
(the "CenterState SEC Reports") is publicly available. No such CenterState SEC
Report, at the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except
that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of
this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.
As of their respective dates, all CenterState SEC Reports filed or furnished
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of
CenterState has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of
him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date
of this Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or material
unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the CenterState SEC
Reports.

 

Section 4.07.Financial Statements.

 

(a)The financial statements of CenterState and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the CenterState SEC Reports (including the
related notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in
accordance with, the books and records of CenterState and its Subsidiaries,
(ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of
operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders' equity and consolidated
financial position of CenterState and its Subsidiaries for the respective
fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the
case of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature
and amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the
SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv)
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in
the notes thereto. The books and records of CenterState and its Subsidiaries
have been, since January 1, 2016, and are being, maintained in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting
requirements. Crowe Horwath LLP has not resigned (or informed CenterState that
it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
CenterState as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with
CenterState on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

   

(b)Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on CenterState, neither CenterState
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due
or to become due), except (i) for those liabilities that are reflected or
reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of CenterState included in
its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017
(including any notes thereto), (ii) for liabilities incurred in the Ordinary
Course of Business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2017, or
(iii) in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(c)The records, systems, controls, data and information of CenterState and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of CenterState or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on CenterState.
CenterState (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to CenterState, including its Subsidiaries, is
made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
CenterState by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the
date hereof, to CenterState's outside auditors and the audit committee of
CenterState's board of directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect CenterState's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and (y) to the knowledge
of CenterState, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in CenterState's internal
controls over financial reporting. To the knowledge of CenterState, there is
no reason to believe that CenterState's outside auditors and its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 

(d)Since January 1, 2016, (i) neither CenterState nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of CenterState, any director, executive officer,
auditor, accountant or representative of CenterState or any of its
Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or, to the
knowledge of CenterState, oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of CenterState or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or written claim that
CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting
or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing CenterState or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by CenterState or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by CenterState or any of
its officers, directors, employees or agents to the board of directors of
CenterState or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of CenterState, to
any director or officer of CenterState.

   

Section 4.08.Taxes.

 

(a)Each of CenterState and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (taking
into account all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all
jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all
such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects.
Neither CenterState nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return. All material
Taxes of CenterState and its Subsidiaries that are due have been fully and
timely paid. Each of CenterState and its Subsidiaries have withheld and paid
all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with
amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, stockholder, independent
contractor or other third party. No deficiency with respect to a material
amount of Taxes has been proposed, asserted or assessed, in each case, in
writing, against CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no pending
or threatened in writing disputes, claims, audits, examinations or other
proceedings regarding any material Taxes of CenterState and its Subsidiaries
or the assets of CenterState and its Subsidiaries. In the last three (3)
years, neither CenterState nor its Subsidiaries have been informed in writing
by any jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that CenterState or its
Subsidiaries were required to file any Tax Return that was not filed. There
are no Liens for material Taxes (except Taxes not yet due and payable or Taxes
being contested in good faith) on any of the assets of CenterState or any of
its Subsidiaries. Neither CenterState nor its Subsidiaries is a party to or is
bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or
arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between
CenterState and its Subsidiaries). Neither CenterState nor its Subsidiaries
(i) have been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal
income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent of which was
CenterState) or (ii) has a liability for Taxes of any Person (other than
CenterState and its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6
(or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or
successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither CenterState nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been, within the past two (2) years or otherwise as part of a
"plan (or series of related transactions)" within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a part, a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section
355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. Neither CenterState nor its
Subsidiaries have participated in a "listed transaction" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

 

Section 4.09.Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

 

(a)Since September 30, 2017, no event or events have occurred that have had or
would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on CenterState.

 

(b)Since September 30, 2017, except with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby or as required or permitted by this Agreement, CenterState
and its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all
material respects in the ordinary course.

 

Section 4.10.Legal Proceedings.

 

(a)Neither CenterState nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and
there are no pending or, to CenterState's knowledge, threatened, legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental
or regulatory investigations of any nature against CenterState or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to CenterState's knowledge, any of their current or former
directors or executive officers (i) that would reasonably be likely to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) reasonably likely to prevent,
materially impede or

   

materially delay its ability to perform its covenants or agreements under this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b)There is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory
restriction imposed upon CenterState, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of
CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the
Merger, would apply to the Surviving Entity or any of its affiliates).

 

Compliance with Applicable Law.

 

CenterState and each of its Subsidiaries hold, and have at all times since
December 31, 2014 held, all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations
necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses and ownership
of their respective properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each
(and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection

statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not
misleading; provided, however, that in each case any information contained in
a CenterState SEC Report as of a later date shall be deemed to modify

material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or
warranty is made by CenterState with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information provided or supplied by
or on behalf of Charter or its Subsidiaries for inclusion in the Proxy

Loan Portfolio.

 

 Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on CenterState, each outstanding Loan
of CenterState and its Subsidiaries (including Loans held for resale to
investors) was originated, and has been administered and, where applicable,
serviced, and the relevant Loan files are being maintained, in all material
respects in accordance with the relevant notes or other credit or security

applicable underwriting standards, if any, of the applicable investors) and

proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the
amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or upon the receipt of
any comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC or its staff, and shall
supply Charter with copies of all correspondence between CenterState and the
SEC with respect to the Registration Statement. CenterState will provide
Charter and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement-Prospectus, and all
responses to requests for additional information by and replies to comments of
the SEC prior to filing such with, or sending such to, the SEC, and
CenterState will provide Charter and its counsel with a copy of all such
filings made with the SEC. If at any time prior to the Charter Meeting there
shall occur any event that should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Registration Statement, CenterState
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file
such amendment or supplement with the SEC (if required under applicable Law)
and cooperate with Charter to mail such amendment or supplement to Charter
stockholders (if required under applicable Law).

 

Section 5.06.Regulatory Filings; Consents.

 

(a)Each of CenterState and Charter and their respective Subsidiaries shall
cooperate and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts (i) to
promptly prepare all documentation, and to effect all filings, to obtain all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Regulatory Approvals and all other consents and
approvals of a Governmental Authority required to consummate the Merger in the
manner contemplated herein, (ii) to comply with the terms and conditions of
such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations, (iii) to resolve any
objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated

   

herein, and (iv) to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
be consummated as expeditiously as practicable; provided, however,
notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require CenterState or any of its
Subsidiaries or Charter or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action, or
commit to take any such action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in
connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of any Governmental Authority that would reasonably be likely
to have a material and adverse effect (measured on a scale relative to
Charter) on the condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations,
liquidity, assets or deposit liabilities, properties or business of
CenterState, Charter, the Surviving Entity or the Surviving Bank, after giving
effect to the Merger (together, the "Burdensome Conditions"); provided,
further, that those actions set forth in CenterState Disclosure Schedule
Section 5.06 shall not constitute a "Burdensome Condition" CenterState and
Charter will furnish each other and each other's counsel with all information
concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, trustees, officers and
shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, and such other matters as may be
necessary or advisable in connection with any application, petition or any
other statement or application made by or on behalf of CenterState or Charter
to any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Each Party hereto shall have the right to review and
approve in advance all characterizations of the information relating to such
Party and any of its Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any Governmental
Authority, other than material filed in connection therewith under a claim of
confidentiality. CenterState shall, as soon as is practicable, but no later
than thirty (30) days after the date hereof, make all filings with
Governmental Authorities. In addition, CenterState and Charter shall each
furnish to the other for review a copy of each such filing made in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any Governmental
Authority prior to its filing.

 

(b)Subject to applicable Laws (including those relating to the exchange of
information), CenterState and Charter shall keep each other apprised of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject
to applicable Laws, the Parties shall (i) promptly furnish each other with
copies of notices or other communications received by each Party (or written
or oral summaries of communications received orally), from any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
(ii) provide the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review in advance,
and accept the reasonable comments of the other Party in connection with, any
proposed communication to, including any filings with or other written
materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority.

 

(c)Charter will use its commercially reasonable efforts, and CenterState shall
reasonably cooperate with Charter at Charter's request, to obtain all
consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers or similar affirmations described
in Charter Disclosure Schedule Section 3.13(c). Each Party will notify the
other Party promptly and shall promptly furnish the other Party with copies of
notices or other communications received by such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries of any communication from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person (or another Person) is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from
such Party, its Subsidiaries or its representatives). Charter will consult
with CenterState and its representatives as often as practicable under the
circumstances so as to permit Charter and CenterState and their respective
representatives to cooperate to take appropriate measures to obtain such
consents and avoid or mitigate any adverse consequences that may result from
the foregoing.

 

Publicity.

 

 CenterState and Charter shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement without the prior consent of the other Party, which shall not be
unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld; provided, however, that a Party
may, without the prior consent of the other Party (but after such
consultation, to the extent practicable in

   

the circumstances), issue such press release or make such public statements as
may upon the advice of counsel be required by Law or the rules and regulations
of any stock exchanges. It is understood that CenterState shall assume primary
responsibility for the preparation of joint press releases relating to this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.08.Access; Current Information.

 

(a)For the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of Charter
and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this
Agreement, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, Charter
agrees to afford CenterState and its officers, employees, counsel, accountants
and other authorized representatives such access during normal business hours
at any time and from time to time throughout the period prior to the Effective
Time to Charter's and CharterBank's books, records (including, without
limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), information
technology systems, business, properties and personnel and to such other
information relating to them as the CenterState may reasonably request and
Charter shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide any
appropriate notices to employees and/or customers in accordance with
applicable Law and Charter's privacy policy and, during such period, Charter
shall furnish to CenterState, upon CenterState's reasonable request, all such
other information concerning the business, properties and personnel of Charter
and CharterBank that is substantially similar in scope to the information
provided to CenterState in connection with its diligence review prior to the
date of this Agreement.

 

(b)As promptly as reasonably practicable after they become available, Charter
will furnish to CenterState copies of the board packages distributed to the
board of directors of Charter or CharterBank, and minutes from the meetings
thereof and all committees thereof, copies of any internal management
financial control reports showing actual financial performance against plan
and previous period, and copies of any reports provided to the board of
directors of Charter or any committee thereof relating to the financial
performance, operations, or risk management of Charter.

 

(c)During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
each of Charter and CenterState will cause one or more of its designated
representatives to confer on a regular basis with representatives of the other
Party and to report the general status of the ongoing operations of Charter
and CharterBank and CenterState and its Subsidiaries, respectively. Without
limiting the foregoing, Charter agrees to provide to CenterState (i) a copy of
each report filed by Charter or CharterBank with a Governmental Authority
unless it is a confidential communication with a Governmental Authority and
Charter is prohibited by Law from sharing such report, (ii) a copy of
Charter's monthly loan trial balance, and (iii) a copy of Charter's monthly
statement of condition and profit and loss statement and, if requested by
CenterState, a copy of Charter's daily statement of condition and daily profit
and loss statement, in each case, which shall be provided as promptly as
reasonably practicable after it is filed or prepared, as applicable.

 

(d)No investigation by either Party or its representatives shall be deemed to
modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
other Party set forth in this Agreement, or the conditions to the respective
obligations of either Party to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(e)Charter shall provide to CenterState, any and all information received by
Charter in connection with the ESOP Determination.

 

(f)Charter shall not be required to give CenterState any documents (including
under Sections 5.08(a) and (b)) that disclose any confidential supervisory
information or any other matter that Charter's board of directors has been
advised by counsel that such distribution to CenterState may violate

   

a confidentiality obligation or fiduciary duty or any Law or regulation, or
may result in a waiver of Charter's attorney-client privilege. In the event
any of the restrictions in this Section 5.08(g) shall apply, Charter shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to provide appropriate consents, waivers,
decrees and approvals necessary to satisfy any confidentiality issues relating
to documents prepared or held by third parties (including work papers), and
the Parties will make appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements, including
adopting additional specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of
sensitive material and to ensure compliance with applicable Laws.

 

Section 5.09.No Solicitation by Charter; Superior Proposals.

 

(a)Charter shall not, and shall cause CharterBank and each of their respective
officers, directors and employees not to, and will not authorize any
investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, consultants,
affiliates or other agents of Charter or CharterBank (collectively, the
"Charter Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action to facilitate the making of,
any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) except as permitted by this
Section 5.09, participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any Person
(other than CenterState) any information or data with respect to Charter or
CharterBank or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) except as
permitted by this Section 5.09, release any Person from, waive any provisions
of, or fail to enforce any confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement
to which Charter is a party; or (iv) except as permitted by this Section 5.09,
enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any
Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of
intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by any of the Charter Representatives, whether or not such
Charter Representative is so authorized and whether or not such Charter
Representative is purporting to act on behalf of Charter or otherwise, shall
be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Charter. Charter and CharterBank
shall, and shall cause each of the Charter Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions,
negotiations, and communications with any Persons with respect to any existing
or potential Acquisition Proposal.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry,
offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from CenterState),
whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" means (A) any
transaction or series of transactions involving any merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving Charter or CharterBank; (B) any transaction pursuant to
which any third party or group acquires or would acquire (whether through
sale, lease or other disposition), directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the
assets of Charter or CharterBank; (C) any issuance, sale or other disposition
of (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or any similar
transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase or
securities convertible into, such securities) representing 20% or more of the
votes attached to the outstanding securities of Charter or CharterBank; (D)
any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any
third party or group beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity
securities of Charter or CharterBank; or (E) any transaction which is similar
in form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions, or any
combination of the foregoing. 

 

(b)Notwithstanding Section 5.09(a) or any other provision of this Agreement,
prior to the Charter Meeting, Charter may take any of the actions described in
Section 5.09(a) if, but only if, (i) Charter has received a bona fide
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach

   

of Section 5.09(a); (ii) the board of directors of Charter reasonably
determines in good faith, after consultation with and having considered the
advice of its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that (A)
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (B) it is reasonably necessary to take such actions to
comply with its fiduciary duties to Charter's stockholders under applicable
Law; (iii) Charter has provided CenterState with at least three (3) Business
Days' prior notice of such determination; and (iv) prior to furnishing or
affording access to any information or data with respect to Charter or
CharterBank or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, Charter receives
from such Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to
Charter than those contained in the confidentiality agreement with
CenterState. Charter shall promptly provide to CenterState any non-public
information regarding Charter or CharterBank provided to any other Person
which was not previously provided to CenterState, such additional information
to be provided no later than the date such information is provided to such
other Party.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide,
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (i) that if consummated would result in a
third party (or in the case of a direct merger between such third party and
Charter or CharterBank, the shareholders of such third party) acquiring,
directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding Charter Common Stock
or more than 50% of the assets of Charter and CharterBank, taken as a whole,
for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities and (ii) that the board
of directors of Charter reasonably determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, (A)
is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial,
legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, including all conditions
contained therein and the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, and (B)
taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed by CenterState in
response to such Acquisition Proposal as contemplated by Section 5.09(e), such
proposal, is more favorable to the stockholders of Charter from a financial
point of view than the Merger.

 

(c)Charter shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify CenterState in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any
information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought
to be initiated or continued with, Charter or the Charter Representatives, in
each case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall
indicate the name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or
making such proposal, offer or information request and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials
relating to such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or
discussion, providing copies of such materials (including e-mails or other
electronic communications), except to the extent that (i) discussions of such
materials jeopardizes the attorney-client privilege or (ii) disclosure of such
materials contravenes any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree).
Charter agrees that it shall keep CenterState informed, on a reasonably
current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposal, offer,
information request, negotiations or discussions (including any amendments or
modifications to such proposal, offer or request).

 

(d)Subject to Section 5.09(e), neither the board of directors of Charter nor
any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, or propose
to withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to CenterState in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger), the Charter Recommendation, fail to reaffirm the Charter
Recommendation within three (3) Business Days following a request by
CenterState, or make any statement, filing or release, in connection with the
Charter Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the Charter Recommendation (it
being understood that taking a neutral position or no position with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification of the
Charter Recommendation); (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into (or cause Charter or
CharterBank to enter into) any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other agreement (A) related to any Acquisition
Transaction (other than a confidentiality

   

agreement entered into in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.09(b))
or (B) requiring Charter to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e)Notwithstanding Section 5.09(d) and subject to compliance with this Section
5.09(e), prior to the approval of the Merger at the Charter Meeting, the board
of directors of Charter may approve or recommend approval of a Superior
Proposal to the Charter stockholders and withdraw, qualify, amend or modify
the Charter Recommendation or take any of the other actions otherwise
prohibited by Section 5.09 (a "Charter Subsequent Determination") after the
fifth (5th) Business Day following CenterState's receipt of a notice (the
"Notice of Superior Proposal") from Charter advising CenterState that the
board of directors of Charter has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not result from a breach of
this Section 5.09(a) constitutes a Superior Proposal if, but only if, (i) the
board of directors of Charter has determined in good faith, after consultation
with and having considered the advice of outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor, that it is reasonably necessary to take such actions to
comply with its fiduciary duties to Charter's stockholders under applicable
Law, (ii) during the five (5) Business Day period after receipt of the Notice
of Superior Proposal by CenterState (the "Notice Period"), Charter and the
board of directors of Charter shall have cooperated and negotiated in good
faith with CenterState to make such adjustments, modifications or amendments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable Charter to
proceed with the Charter Recommendation without a Charter Subsequent
Determination; provided, however, that CenterState shall not have any
obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and (iii) at the end of the Notice
Period, after taking into account any such adjusted, modified or amended terms
as may have been proposed by CenterState since its receipt of such Notice of
Superior Proposal, the board of directors of Charter has again in good faith
made the determination (A) in clause (i) of this Section 5.09(e) and (B) that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. In the event of
any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, Charter shall be required to
deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal to CenterState and again comply with
the requirements of this Section 5.09(e), except that the Notice Period shall
be reduced to three (3) Business Days.

 

(f)Nothing contained in this Section 5.09 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit Charter or the board of directors of Charter from complying with
Charter's obligations required under Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act; provided, however, that any such disclosure relating to an
Acquisition Proposal (other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act)
shall be deemed a change in the Charter Recommendation unless the board of
directors of Charter reaffirms the Charter Recommendation in such disclosure.

 

Section 5.10.Indemnification. 

 

(a)For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, and in any
event subject to the provisions of Section 5.10(c)(iv), CenterState shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former directors, officers
and employees of Charter and CharterBank (the "Indemnified Parties"), against
all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, or liabilities or amounts that are paid in
settlement (which settlement shall require the prior written consent of
CenterState, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative arising out of actions or
omissions of such persons in the course of performing their duties for Charter
or CharterBank occurring at or before the Effective Time (including the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (each a "Claim"),
regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after, the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such

   

persons have the right to be indemnified pursuant to the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of Charter or similar governing documents of
CharterBank in effect on the date of this Agreement and to the extent
permitted by applicable Maryland Law. CenterState shall pay such expenses to
each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by the provisions of
Maryland Law and the Charter Articles and Charter Bylaws.

 

(b)In connection with the indemnification provided pursuant to Section 5.10,
CenterState and/or an CenterState Bank will advance expenses, promptly after
statements therefor are received, to each Indemnified Party, to the same
extent required by the Charter Articles and the articles of incorporation of
CharterBank in effect on the date of this Agreement to the extent permitted by
applicable Law (provided the individual to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking to repay such advance if it is ultimately determined that such
individual is not entitled to indemnification), including the payment of the
fees and expenses of one counsel with respect to a matter, and one local
counsel in each applicable jurisdiction, if necessary or appropriate, selected
by such Indemnified Party or multiple Indemnified Parties (and, in each case,
reasonably acceptable to CenterState), it being understood that they
collectively shall only be entitled to one counsel and one local counsel in
each applicable jurisdiction where necessary or appropriate (unless a conflict
shall exist between them in which case they may retain separate counsel).

 

(c)Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
5.10 shall promptly notify CenterState upon learning of any Claim, provided
that, failure to so notify shall not affect the obligation of CenterState
under this Section 5.10, unless, and only to the extent that, CenterState is
materially prejudiced in the defense of such Claim as a consequence. In the
event of any such Claim (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time), (i) CenterState shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and CenterState shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for
any legal expenses or other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof
except that if CenterState elects not to assume such defense, the Indemnified
Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them, and CenterState
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties (provided that CenterState shall only be obligated to pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of one such counsel), (ii) the Indemnified
Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii) CenterState
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent and (iv) CenterState shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party if such indemnification would be in violation of any
applicable federal or state banking Laws or regulations, or in the event that
a federal or state banking agency or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Laws, whether or not related
to banking Laws.

 

(d)For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, CenterState
will maintain director's and officer's liability insurance (herein, "DandO
Insurance") that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and
directors of Charter or CharterBank (determined as of the Effective Time) with
respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or
events occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated hereby), which insurance will contain at least the same coverage
and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Party, as that coverage currently provided by Charter; provided
that, if CenterState is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for
by this Section 5.10, CenterState will provide as much comparable insurance as
is reasonably available (subject to the limitations described below in this
Section 5.10(c)); and provided, further, that officers and directors of
Charter or CharterBank may be required to make application and provide
customary representations and warranties to the carrier of the DandO Insurance
for the purpose of obtaining such insurance. In no event shall CenterState be
required to expend for such tail insurance a premium amount in excess of an
amount equal to two hundred percent (200%) of the annual premiums paid by
Charter for DandO Insurance in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the
"Maximum

   

DandO Tail Premium"). If the cost of such tail insurance exceeds the Maximum
DandO Tail Premium, CenterState shall obtain tail insurance coverage or a
separate tail insurance policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding the Maximum DandO Tail Premium. For the avoidance of doubt,
CenterState shall not be required to purchase stand-alone coverage for cyber
liability or fidelity bonds.

 

(e)This Section 5.10 shall survive the Effective Time, is intended to benefit
each Indemnified Party (each of whom shall be entitled to enforce this Section
5.10 against CenterState), and shall be binding on all successors and assigns
of CenterState. This Section 5.10 shall not be amended, altered or repealed
after the Effective Time without the prior written consent of the affected
Indemnified Party.

 

(f)If CenterState or any of its successors and assigns (i) shall consolidate
with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its property and assets to
any individual, corporation or other entity, then, in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of CenterState and
its Subsidiaries shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

 

Section 5.11.Employees; Benefit Plans.

 

(a)Following the Effective Time, CenterState shall maintain or cause to be
maintained employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the
benefit of employees who are full time employees of Charter or CharterBank on
the Closing Date ("Covered Employees") that provide employee benefits and
compensation opportunities which, in the aggregate, are substantially
comparable to the employee benefits and compensation opportunities that are
made available on a uniform and non-discriminatory basis to similarly situated
employees of CenterState or its Subsidiaries, as applicable; provided,
however, that in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to
participate in any closed or frozen plan of CenterState or its Subsidiaries,
including any such plan that is closed or frozen with respect to new employee
of CenterState. CenterState shall give the Covered Employees full credit for
their prior service with Charter and CharterBank (i) for purposes of
eligibility (including initial participation and eligibility for current
benefits) and vesting under any qualified or non-qualified employee benefit
plan maintained by CenterState and in which Covered Employees may be eligible
to participate and (ii) for all purposes under any welfare benefit plans,
vacation plans, severance plans and similar arrangements maintained by
CenterState.

 

(b)With respect to any employee benefit plan of CenterState that is a health,
dental, vision or other welfare plan in which any Covered Employee is eligible
to participate, for the plan year in which such Covered Employee is first
eligible to participate, CenterState or its applicable Subsidiary shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause any pre-existing condition
limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such CenterState or
Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee and his or
her covered dependents to the extent such condition was or would have been
covered under the Charter Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) recognize any
health, dental, vision or other welfare expenses incurred by such Covered
Employee and his or her covered dependents in the year that includes the
Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Covered Employee is first
eligible to participate) for purposes of any applicable copayment, deductibles
and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such health, dental,
vision or other welfare plan. Neither CenterState nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall terminate the existing coverage of any Covered Employee or his or her
dependents under any of the Charter or CharterBank health plans prior to the
time such Covered Employees and their dependents become eligible to

   

participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to all employees
of CenterState or any CenterState Subsidiary and their dependents.

 

(c)Prior to the Effective Time, Charter shall take, and shall cause
CharterBank to take, all actions requested by CenterState no later than ten
(10) days prior to the Effective Time that may be necessary or appropriate to
(i) cause one or more Charter Benefits Plans to terminate as of the Effective
Time, or as of the date immediately preceding the date that includes the
Effective Time, (ii) cause benefit accruals and entitlements under any Charter
Benefit Plan to cease as of the Effective Time, or as of the date immediately
preceding that date that includes the Effective Time, (iii) cause the
continuation on and after the Effective Time of any contract, arrangement or
insurance policy relating to any Charter Benefit Plan for such period as may
be requested by CenterState, or (iv) facilitate the merger of any Charter
Benefit Plan into any employee benefit plan maintained by CenterState or a
CenterState Subsidiary; provided that Charter shall not be required to take
any action that would result in the violation by Charter of any contract with
a third party. All resolutions, notices, or other documents issued, adopted or
executed in connection with the implementation of this Section 5.11(c) shall
be subject to CenterState's reasonable prior review and approval, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If CenterState requires
Charter to terminate a medical plan having a flexible spending arrangement
("FSA") under Code Section 125, Charter and each of its Subsidiaries may
continue its FSA through the Effective Time.

 

(d)Nothing in this Section 5.11 shall be construed to limit the right of
CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date,
Charter and CharterBank) to amend or terminate any Charter Benefit Plan or
other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is
permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall anything in this
Section 5.11 be construed to require CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, following the Closing Date, Charter and CharterBank) to retain the
employment of any particular Covered Employee for any fixed period of time
following the Closing Date, and the continued retention (or termination) by
CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries of any Covered Employee subsequent to
the Effective Time shall be subject in all events to CenterState's or its
applicable Subsidiary's normal and customary employment procedures and
practices, including customary background screening and evaluation procedures,
and satisfactory employment performance.

 

(e)If, within the period ending on the later of (i) six (6) months after the
Effective Time or (ii) forty-five (45) days after the completion of the
Informational Systems Conversion, unless otherwise addressed in an employment
agreement entered into with CenterState Bank or an employment, change in
control or severance agreement set forth in Charter Disclosure Schedule
Section 3.11(a), any Covered Employee who is terminated by CenterState or its
Subsidiaries other than "for cause" (as defined under the policies of
CenterState and/or its Subsidiaries) or resigns because he or she was offered
a position with a material reduction in rate of base pay or that is outside a
50-mile radius of the current address of his or her primary work location at
Charter, then CenterState shall, subject to such Covered Employee's execution
of appropriate releases, pay severance to such Covered Employee in an amount
equal to two (2) weeks of base salary for each twelve (12) months of such

however, that in no event will the total amount of severance for any single
Covered Employee be less than four (4) weeks of such base salary nor greater
than twenty-six (26) weeks of such base salary. Any severance to which a
Covered Employee may be entitled in connection with a termination occurring
more than six (6) months after the Effective Time will be as set forth in the
severance policies of CenterState and its Subsidiaries as then in effect.

number of shares of Charter Common Stock held by the ESOP's unallocated
suspense account to Charter to repay the full outstanding balance of the loan
between the Charter ESOP and Charter (the "Charter ESOP Loan") (and with such
Charter Common Stock valued on the ESOP Termination Date) and, if after
remitting such shares there remains any unpaid amount under the Charter ESOP
Loan, such unpaid amount, including any unpaid but accrued interest, shall be
forgiven by Charter at the Effective Time. All remaining shares of Charter
Common Stock held by the Charter ESOP as of the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Charter shall

(5) Business Days following the date all Regulatory Approvals required to
consummate the Merger and the Bank Merger in the manner contemplate herein
have been obtained, all necessary documents with the IRS for a determination
letter for termination of the Charter ESOP. As soon as practicable following
the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS regarding the
qualified status of the Charter ESOP upon its termination, the account
balances in the Charter ESOP shall either be disbursed to participants and
beneficiaries or transferred to an eligible tax qualified retirement plan or
individual retirement account as a participant or beneficiary may direct.
Charter shall adopt the necessary amendment(s) and board resolution(s) to
effect the provisions of this Section 5.11(h).

 

(i)CenterState shall take all commercially reasonable actions necessary to
cause the trustee of the CenterState Banks, Inc. Employee Savings Trust, if
requested to do so by a Covered Employee, to accept a direct "rollover" in
cash of all or a portion of such employee's distribution from the Charter Bank
401(k) Plan (provided that the CenterState Banks, Inc. Employee Savings Trust
shall only accept cash and not in-kind rollovers). In the case of a Covered
Employee with an outstanding loan under the Charter Bank 401(k) Plan,
CenterState shall use commercially reasonable efforts to permit the Covered
Employee to rollover such outstanding loan balance to the CenterState Banks
Inc. Employee Savings Trust (subject to the requirements and limitations of
the applicable provisions of the Code), provided, however, that the Covered
Employee may transfer such loan only if such Covered Employee elects to
rollover his or her entire account balance under the Charter Bank 401(k) Plan.

 

(j)Charter shall establish a retention bonus pool to be paid to certain
Charter employees as shall be determined by Charter after consultation with
CenterState (including in amounts of payments and timing of payments), with
the aggregate amount of such retention bonuses payable pursuant to the
retention bonus pool not to exceed $850,000 in the aggregate. CenterState may
establish an additional retention bonus pool, with such recipients, amounts of
payments and timing of payments designated by CenterState. 

   

Notification of Certain Changes.

 

 Charter and CenterState shall promptly advise the other Party of any change
or event having, or which could reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect or which it believes would, or which could reasonably be
expected to, cause or constitute a material breach of any of its or its
respective Subsidiaries' representations, warranties or covenants contained
herein. and Charter shall provide on a periodic basis written notice to
CenterState of any matters that Charter becomes aware of which, if existing,
occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth or described in such Charter Disclosure Schedule or which is
necessary to correct any information in such Charter Disclosure Schedule which
has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby; provided, that any failure to
give notice in accordance with the foregoing shall not be deemed to constitute
a violation of this Section 5.12 or the failure of any condition set forth in
Section 6.03(a) or Section 6.03(b), as the case may be, to be satisfied, or
otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give
such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently
result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 6.03(a) or Section
6.03(b), as the case may be, to be satisfied.. No supplement or amendment to
the Charter Disclosure Schedule or provision of information relating to the
subject matter of the Charter Disclosure Schedule after the date of this
Agreement shall operate to cure any breach of a representation or warranty
made herein or have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of
or compliance by Charter with the respective covenants and agreements of such
parties set forth herein.

 From and after the date hereof, CenterState and Charter shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the integration of Charter with

indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Charter or
CharterBank prior to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Charter, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of CenterState or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Charter and CenterState

stockholder litigation and shall not settle any such litigation prior to such
consultation and consideration;

   

provided, however, that Charter shall not settle any such shareholder or
stockholder litigation if such settlement requires the payment of money
damages, without the written consent of CenterState (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the payment of any such
damages by Charter is reasonably expected by Charter, following consultation
with outside counsel, to be fully covered (disregarding any deductible to be
paid by Charter) under Charter's existing director and officer insurance
policies.

Agreement (collectively, "Charter Expenses"). Charter shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the aggregate amount of all Charter
Expenses to not exceed the total expenses disclosed in Charter Disclosure
Schedule Section 5.20. Charter shall promptly notify CenterState if or when
it determines that it expects to materially exceed its estimate for Charter
Expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.21,

similar financial advisory fees in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement other than those expressly set forth in Charter
Disclosure Schedule Section 3.23.

employees, consultants and advisors have provided, and will continue to
provide one another with information which may be deemed by the Party
providing the information to be non-public, proprietary and/or confidential,
including, but not limited to, trade secrets of the disclosing Party. Each
Party agrees that it will, and will cause its representatives to, hold any
information so obtained pursuant to this Article V in accordance with the
terms of the confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement, dated as of
February 28, 2018 between CenterState and Charter.

 

Tax Matters.

 

 The Parties intend that the Merger qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement constitute a
"plan of reorganization" as that term is used in Sections 354 and 361 of the
Code. Except as expressly contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, from
and after the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each of
CenterState and Charter shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the

within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

Trust Preferred Securities.

 

 Prior to the Effective Time, CenterState and Charter shall take all actions
necessary for CenterState to enter into, and CenterState shall enter into,
supplemental indentures with the trustee(s) of the indentures for Charter's
outstanding floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures
(the "Charter Debentures") issued in connection with the issuance of the trust
securities of CBS Financial Capital Trust I and CBS Financial Capital Trust II
in order to evidence the assumption by CenterState of such indentures as of
the Effective Time. The form of the supplemental indenture shall be reasonably
acceptable to CenterState, and, pursuant to such supplemental indenture,
CenterState will agree to assume the covenants, agreements and obligations of
Charter under the indenture, including the obligations to make all payments
when due in respect of the Charter Debentures.

 Neither CenterState nor Charter may rely on the failure of any condition set

CenterState) or Section 6.03(a) (in the case of a breach of a representation
or warranty by Charter).

Business Day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, CenterState
shall have the option to increase the Merger Consideration by either (1)

paying, as part of the Merger Consideration, a cash payment in addition to,

within such five (5) Business Day period, then it shall give prompt written
notice to Charter of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio or the
Additional Cash Consideration, as applicable, whereupon no termination shall
have occurred pursuant to this Section 7.01(i) and this Agreement shall remain

Agreement to the "Exchange Ratio" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the
Exchange Ratio as increased pursuant to this Section 7.01(i), if applicable,
and any references in this Agreement to the Cash Consideration shall

Section 7.02.Termination Fee; Expenses.

 

(a)In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities foregone by
CenterState while structuring and pursuing the Merger, Charter shall pay to
CenterState a termination fee equal to $14,485,624 ("Termination Fee"), by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by

terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(g) or Charter terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(h), Charter shall pay CenterState the
Termination Fee within one (1) Business Day after receipt of CenterState's
notification of such termination; and (ii) in the event that after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been made known to senior management of Charter or has
been made directly to its stockholders generally or any Person shall have
publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
Charter and (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated (x) by either
CenterState or Charter pursuant to Section 7.01(c) because the Requisite
Charter Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained or (y) by
CenterState pursuant to Section 7.01(d) or Section 7.01(e) and (B) prior to
the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination,
Charter enters into any agreement or consummates an Acquisition Transaction
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition
Proposal as that referred to above), then Charter shall, on the earlier of the
date it enters into such agreement and the date of consummation of such
Acquisition Transaction, pay CenterState the Termination Fee, provided, that
for purposes of this Section 7.02(a)(ii), all references in the definition of
Acquisition Transaction to "20%" shall instead refer to "50%."

 

(b)If CenterState or Charter terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.01(b) and the denial of the applicable Regulatory Approval by the applicable
Governmental Authority is caused solely by CenterState and its Subsidiaries,
CenterState shall, on the date of termination, pay to Charter the sum of
$2,000,000 (the "Reverse Termination Fee"). The Reverse Termination Fee shall
be paid to Charter in same-day funds. 

 

(c)Charter and CenterState each agree that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, CenterState would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if Charter fails promptly to pay any amounts
due under this Section 7.02, Charter shall pay interest on such amounts from
the date payment of such amounts were due to the date of actual payment at the
rate of interest equal to the sum of (i) the rate of interest published from
time to time in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition (or any successor
publication thereto), designated therein as the prime rate on the date such
payment was due, plus (ii) 200 basis points, together with the costs and
expenses of CenterState (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit.

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Parties agree that if a Party pays or causes to be paid to the other Party the
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.02(a) or the Reverse Termination
fee in accordance Section 7.02(b), as applicable, the Party paying such
Termination Fee or Reverse Termination (or any successor in interest thereof)
will not have any further obligations or liabilities to the other Party with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Effect of Termination.

 

 Except as set forth in Section 7.02(d), termination of this Agreement will
not relieve a breaching Party from liability for any breach of any covenant,

(b)Each Party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise
under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues,
and therefore each such Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives
any right such Party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation
directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party certifies and
acknowledges that (i) no representative, agent or attorney of any other Party
has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not, in
the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (ii) each Party
understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (iii) each
Party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (iv) each

   

Party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things,
the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 9.03.

 

(c)Each Party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect of
any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in any federal or state court of competent
jurisdiction located in the State of Florida (the "Florida Courts"), and,
solely in connection with claims arising under this Agreement or the
transactions that are the subject of this Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Florida Courts, (ii) waives any objection
to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the Florida Courts, (iii)
waives any objection that the Florida Courts are an inconvenient forum or do
not have jurisdiction over any Party and (iv) agrees that service of process
upon such Party in any such action or proceeding will be effective if notice
is given in accordance with Section 9.05.

 

Expenses.

 

 Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.02, each Party will bear all
expenses incurred by it in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including fees and expenses of its own financial
consultants, accountants and counsel. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall limit either Party's rights to recover any liabilities or damages
arising out of the other Party's willful breach of any provision of this
Agreement.

 

Notices.

 

 All notices, requests and other communications hereunder to a Party, shall
be in writing and shall be deemed properly given if delivered (a) personally,
(b) by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), with adequate
postage prepaid thereon, (c) by properly addressed electronic mail delivery
(with confirmation of delivery receipt), or (d) by reputable courier service
to such Party at its address set forth below, or at such other address or

Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries.

 

 This Agreement, including the Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules hereto,
represents the entire understanding of the Parties and hereto with reference
to the transactions contemplated hereby, and this Agreement supersedes any and
all other oral or written agreements heretofore made. Except for the
Indemnified Parties' rights under Section 5.10, CenterState and Charter hereby
agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set
forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other Party, in accordance with
and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended
to, and does not, confer upon any Person (including any Person or employees
who might be affected by Section 5.11), other than the Parties, any rights or
remedies hereunder, including, the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth herein. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations between the Parties and are for the
sole benefit of the Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may
not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 

Severability.

 

 In the event that any one or more provisions of this Agreement shall for any
reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, by any court
of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement and the Parties shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to substitute a valid, legal and
enforceable provision which, insofar as practical, implements the purposes and
intents of this Agreement.

 

Enforcement of the Agreement.

 

 The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction without having to show or prove economic damages and without the
requirement of posting a bond, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 

Section 9.09.Interpretation.

 

(a)When a reference is made in this Agreement to sections, exhibits or
schedules, such reference shall be to a section of, or exhibit or schedule to,
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and captions
and headings contained in this Agreement are included solely for

   

convenience of reference; if there is any conflict between a caption or
heading and the text of this Agreement, the text shall control. Whenever the
words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

 

(b)The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement and the other agreements and documents contemplated herein. In
the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises under
any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement or document
contemplated herein, this Agreement and such other agreements or documents
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of
authorizing any of the provisions of this Agreement or any other agreements or
documents contemplated herein.

 

(c)The Charter Disclosure Schedule and the CenterState Disclosure Schedule, as
well as all other schedules and all exhibits to this Agreement, shall be
deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement.
Any matter disclosed pursuant to any section of either Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed disclosed for purposes of any other section of Article III or
Article IV, respectively, to the extent that applicability of the disclosure
to such other section is reasonably apparent on the face, notwithstanding the
absence of a specific cross-reference, of such disclosure. No item is
required to be set forth in either Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect. The mere
inclusion of an item in either Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by either Party
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect,
or that any breach or violation of applicable Laws or any contract exists or
has actually occurred. This Agreement shall not be interpreted or construed
to require any Person to take any action, or fail to take any action, if to do
so would violate any applicable Law.

 

(d)Any reference contained in this Agreement to specific statutory or
regulatory provisions or to any specific Governmental Authority shall include
any successor statute or regulation, or successor Governmental Authority, as
the case may be. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the
masculine, feminine, and neuter genders will be deemed to be interchangeable,
and the singular includes the plural and vice versa. As used herein, (i) the
term "made available" means any document or other information that was (a)
provided by one Party or its representatives to the other Party or its
representatives prior to the date hereof or (b) included in the virtual data
room of a Party prior to the date hereof, and (ii) the word "or" is not
exclusive. 

 

(e)Unless otherwise specified, the references to "Section" and "Article" in
this Agreement are to the Sections and Article of this Agreement. When used
in this Agreement, words such as "herein", "hereinafter", "hereof", "hereto",
and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole, unless the context clearly
requires otherwise.

 

Assignment.

 

 No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or
obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other Party,
and any purported assignment in violation of this Section 9.10 shall be void.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

 

Counterparts.

 

 This Agreement may be executed and delivered by facsimile or by electronic
data file and in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered
one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the
other Party, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same

   

counterpart. Signatures delivered by facsimile or by electronic data file
shall have the same effect as originals.

 

[Signature Page Follows]

   

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be executed in
counterparts by their duly authorized officers, all as of the day and year
first above written.

EXHIBIT A

 

STOCKHOLDER VOTING AGREEMENT

 

This Stockholder Voting Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into as of the
24th day of April, 2018, by and between CenterState Bank Corporation, a
Florida corporation ("CenterState"), and the undersigned holder
("Stockholder") of Common Stock (as defined herein).

 

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, Stockholder, either in his or her sole
capacity or jointly, is entitled to dispose of (or to direct the disposition
of) and to vote (or to direct the voting of) the number of shares of common
stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), of Charter Financial
Corporation ("Charter"), indicated on the signature page of this Agreement
under the heading "Total Number of Shares of Common Stock Subject to this
Agreement" and any shares of Common Stock acquired (such shares of Common
Stock, which shall (a) include any shares of Common Stock acquired after the
date of this Agreement and (b) exclude any securities beneficially owned by
Stockholder as a trustee or fiduciary whereStockholder does not have voting
power, are collectively referred to herein as the "Shares");

 

WHEREAS, CenterState and Charter propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"; for purposes
of this Agreement, capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein
shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement),
pursuant to which, among other things, Charter will merge with and into
CenterState (the "Merger"); and

 

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of CenterState to enter into the
Merger Agreement, Stockholder is executing this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of, and as a material inducement to,
CenterState entering into the Merger Agreement and proceeding with the
transactions contemplated thereby, and in consideration of the expenses
incurred and to be incurred by CenterState in connection therewith,
Stockholder and CenterState, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as
follows:

 

1.Agreement to Vote Shares. Stockholder agrees that, while this Agreement is
in effect, at any meeting of stockholders of Charter, however called, or at
any adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstances in which Stockholder is
entitled to vote, consent or give any other approval, except as otherwise
agreed to in writing in advance by CenterState, Stockholder shall:

 

    



 |  

(a)

 |  

appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be counted as
present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(b)

 |  

vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, all the Shares as to which
Stockholder has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or direct the
voting, (i) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, any
amendments or modifications of the terms thereof adopted in accordance with
the terms thereof); (ii) in favor of any proposal to adjourn or postpone such
meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies to approve the Merger
Agreement; (iii) against any action or agreement that would result in a breach
of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or
agreement of Charter contained in the Merger Agreement or of Stockholder
contained in this Agreement; and (iv) against any Acquisition Proposal or any
other action, agreement or 

---|---|--- 

 

1

   

    



 |  |  

transaction that is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to impede,
interfere or be inconsistent with, delay, postpone, discourage or materially
and adversely affect consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement or this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 

 

Stockholder further agrees not to vote or execute any written consent to
rescind or amend in any manner any prior vote or written consent, as a
stockholder of Charter, to approve or adopt the Merger Agreement unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. 

 

2.No Transfers. While this Agreement is in effect and prior to any meeting of
stockholders of Charter called in connection with the Merger, Stockholder
agrees not to, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, pledge, assign or
otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option, commitment or other
arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge,
assignment or other disposition of, any of the Shares; provided, however, that
the following transfers shall be permitted: (a) transfers by will or
operation of law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee; (b)
transfers pursuant to any pledge agreement, subject to the pledgee agreeing in
writing, prior to such transfer, to be bound by the terms of this Agreement;
(c) transfers in connection with estate and tax planning purposes, including
transfers to relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, subject to each
transferee agreeing in writing, prior to such transfer, to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement; (d) the disposition or surrender of Shares in
connection with the vesting, settlement or exercise of equity rights as
permitted by the Merger Agreement; (e) transfers to any immediate family
member of Stockholder, or to a trust for the benefit of Stockholder or his or
her immediate family members or upon Stockholder's death; provided that, as a
precondition to such permitted transfer, the transferee has agreed in writing
to abide by the terms of this Agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to
CenterState; and (f) such transfers as CenterState may otherwise permit in its
sole discretion. Any transfer or other disposition in violation of the terms
of this Section 2 shall be null and void. 

 

3.Representations and Warranties of Stockholder. Stockholder represents and
warrants to and agrees with CenterState as follows:

 

    



 |  

(a)

 |  

Stockholder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter into and perform
his, her or its obligations under this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(b)

 |  

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Stockholder, and
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by CenterState,
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Stockholder
enforceable against Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors generally and subject to general principles
of equity. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(c)

 |  

The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder does not, and the
performance by Stockholder of his, her or its obligations hereunder and the
consummation by Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will not,
violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under, any agreement,
instrument, contract or other obligation or any order, arbitration award,
judgment or decree to which Stockholder is a party or by which Stockholder is
bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which Stockholder is subject or,
in the event that Stockholder is a corporation, limited liability company,
partnership, trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or other organizational
document of Stockholder. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(d)

 |  

Stockholder is the direct or joint owner of the Shares. Stockholder does not
have sole or shared voting or dispositive power over any shares of capital
stock of Charter other than the Shares or any other securities convertible
into or exercisable or exchangeable for such capital stock, other 

---|---|--- 

 

2

   

    



 |  |  

than any Charter Stock Options. Stockholder has the right to vote the Shares,
and none of the Shares are subject to any voting trust or other agreement,
arrangement or restriction with respect to the voting of the Shares, except as
contemplated by this Agreement. The Shares do not include shares over which
Stockholder exercises control in a fiduciary capacity for any other person or
entity that is not an Affiliate of Stockholder, and no representation by
Stockholder is made with respect thereto. 

---|---|--- 

 

4.No Solicitation. From and after the date hereof until the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 6 hereof, Stockholder, in his, her or its
capacity as a stockholder of Charter, shall not, nor shall Stockholder in such
capacity authorize any stockholder, member, partner, officer, director,
advisor or representative of Stockholder or any of his, her or its Affiliates
to (and, to the extent applicable to Stockholder, such Stockholder shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to not permit any of his, her or its
representatives or affiliates to), (a) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly
encourage, or take any action to facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer
or proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposal, or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to
any Person (other than CenterState) any information or data with respect to
Charter or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (c) enter into any
agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding or similar arrangement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
(d) solicit proxies with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than the
Merger and the Merger Agreement) or otherwise encourage or assist any party in
taking or planning any action that would reasonably be expected to compete
with, restrain or otherwise serve to interfere with or inhibit the timely
consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement, or (e) initiate a stockholders' vote or action by consent of
Charter's stockholders with respect to an Acquisition Proposal.

 

5.Specific Performance; Remedies; Attorneys' Fees. Stockholder acknowledges
that it is a condition to the willingness of CenterState to enter into the
Merger Agreement that Stockholder execute and deliver this Agreement and that
it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to CenterState if
Stockholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and
that, in the event of any such failure, CenterState will not have an adequate
remedy at law. Accordingly, Stockholder agrees that injunctive relief or
other equitable relief is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will
not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that CenterState has an
adequate remedy at law. In addition, after notice to Stockholder, CenterState
shall have the right to inform any third party that CenterState reasonably
believes to be, or to be contemplating, participating with Stockholder or
receiving from Stockholder assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the
terms of this Agreement and of the rights of CenterState hereunder, and that
participation by any such third party with Stockholder in activities in
violation of Stockholder's agreement with CenterState set forth in this
Agreement may give rise to claims by CenterState against such third party.
All expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses.

 

6.Term of Agreement; Termination. The term of this Agreement shall commence
on the date hereof. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by the
written consent of the parties hereto, and this Agreement shall be
automatically terminated upon the earlier to occur of: (a) termination of the
Merger Agreement, (b) the consummation of the Merger, or (c) three (3) years
from the date hereof; provided, however, that the transfer restrictions in
Section 2 hereof shall be automatically terminated upon the receipt of the
Requisite Charter Stockholder Approval. Upon such termination, no party shall
have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder; provided, however, that
such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any breach of
this Agreement prior to such termination.

 

3

   

7.Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or modified, and no provision hereof may be modified or waived,
except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of
any provision hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other
provision hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a
continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party. 

 

8.Severability. In the event that any one or more provisions of this
Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Agreement, and the parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as
practical, implements the purpose and intents of this Agreement. 

 

9.Capacity as Stockholder. This Agreement shall apply to Stockholder solely
in his, her or its capacity as a stockholder of Charter, and it shall not
apply in any manner to Stockholder in any capacity as a director, officer or
employee of Charter or in any other capacity. For avoidance of doubt, the
parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Agreement shall limit or
restrict Stockholder or any of his, her or its Affiliates who is or becomes
during the term hereof a member of the board of directors or an officer of
Charter or CharterBank from acting, omitting to act or refraining from taking
any action, solely in such person's capacity as a member of the board of
directors or as an officer of Charter or CharterBank consistent with his or
her fiduciary duties in such capacity under applicable law, including under
Section 5.09 of the Merger Agreement.

 

10.Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to any
applicable conflicts of law principles or any other principle that could
require the application of the law of any other jurisdiction. The sole and
exclusive venue for any civil action, counterclaim, proceeding, or litigation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be the courts of record of
the State of Florida in Polk County or the United States District Court,
Middle District of Florida. Each party consents to the jurisdiction of such
Florida courts in any such civil action, counterclaim, proceeding, or
litigation and waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such civil
action, counterclaim, proceeding, or litigation in such Florida courts.
Service of any court paper may be effected on such party by mail, as provided
in this Agreement, or in such other manner as may be provided under applicable
laws, rules of procedure or local rules.

 

11.WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.
EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.

 

4

   

12.Further Assurances. Stockholder agrees not to commence or participate in,
and to take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in any class action
with respect to, any claim, derivative or otherwise, against CenterState,
Charter or any of their respective successors relating to the negotiation,
execution or delivery of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger. From time to time prior to the termination of this
Agreement, at CenterState's request and without further consideration,
Stockholder shall execute and deliver such additional documents and take all
such further action as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the
actions and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

13.Disclosure. To the extent such information is required to be included,
Stockholder hereby permits CenterState to publish and disclose in the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus and S-4 (including, without limitation, all related
documents and schedules filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission)
his, her or its identity and ownership of shares of Common Stock and the
nature of Stockholder's commitments, arrangements and understandings pursuant
to this Agreement.

 

14.Notices. Any notice, consent, demand, request or other communication given
to a party hereto in connection with this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be deemed to have been given to such party (i) when delivered personally
to such party, or (ii) provided that a written acknowledgment of receipt is
obtained, five (5) days after being sent by prepaid certified or registered
mail, or (iii) two (2) days after being sent by a nationally recognized
overnight courier, to the address (if any) specified below for such party (or
to such other address as such party shall have specified by ten (10) days'
advance notice given in accordance with this Section 14).

No waiver, amendment, modification or change of any provision of this
Agreement shall be effective unless and until made in writing and signed by
the Banks. No waiver, forbearance or failure by any Bank of its rights to
enforce any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver or estoppel
of such Bank's right to enforce any other provision of this Agreement or a
continuing waiver by such Bank of compliance with any provision hereof.

 

4

   

Except to the extent Federal law is applicable, this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the

NON-COMPETITION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

 

This Non-Competition and Non-Disclosure Agreement (the "Agreement"), is
entered into as of the 24th day of April, 2018, by and between CenterState
Bank Corporation, a Florida corporation ("CenterState"), and the undersigned
individual ("Director").

 

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
April 24, 2018 (the "Merger Agreement") by and between CenterState and Charter
Financial Corporation, a Maryland corporation ("Charter"), Charter will merge
with and into CenterState (the "Merger"), as a result of which CharterBank, a
federal savings and loan association and wholly-owned subsidiary of Charter
("CharterBank"), will merge with and into CenterState Bank, N.A., a national
banking association and wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterState ("CenterState
Bank");

 

WHEREAS, Director is a stockholder of Charter and/or CharterBank and, as a
result of the Merger and pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, Director and/or the Charter stockholders are expected to
receive significant consideration in exchange for the shares of Charter common
stock held by Director;

 

WHEREAS, prior to the date hereof, Director has served as a member of the
board of directors of Charter and/or CharterBank, and, therefore, Director has
knowledge of the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets (each as
hereinafter defined);

 

WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger, CenterState will succeed to all of the
Confidential Information and Trade Secrets, for which CenterState, as of the
Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), will have paid valuable
consideration and desires reasonable protection; and

 

WHEREAS, it is a material prerequisite to the consummation of the Merger that
certain directors of Charter and CharterBank, including Director, enter into
this Agreement;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and the mutual covenants
and undertakings herein contained, CenterState and Director, each intending to
be legally bound, covenant and agree as follows:

 

1.Restrictive Covenants. 

 

(a)Director acknowledges that (i) CenterState has separately bargained for the
restrictive covenants in this Agreement; and (ii) the types and periods of
restrictions imposed by the covenants in this Agreement are fair and
reasonable to Director and such restrictions will not prevent Director from
earning a livelihood.

 

(b)Having acknowledged the foregoing, solely in the event that the Merger is
consummated, Director covenants and agrees with CenterState as follows:

 

(i)From and after the Effective Time, Director will not disclose or use any
Confidential Information (other than Trade Secrets) for a period of twelve
(12) months from the Effective Time or Trade Secrets for so long as they
remain Trade Secrets, except for any disclosure that is required by applicable
law or court order. In the event that Director is required

 

1

   

by law or court order to disclose any Confidential Information, Director will:
(A) if and to the extent permitted by such law or court order, provide
CenterState with prompt notice of such requirement prior to the disclosure so
that CenterState may waive the requirements of this Agreement or seek an
appropriate protective order at CenterState's sole expense; and (B) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that any Confidential
Information disclosed will be accorded confidential treatment. If, in the
absence of a waiver or protective order, Director is nonetheless, in the
opinion of his counsel, required to disclose Confidential Information,
disclosure may be made only as to that portion of the Confidential Information
that counsel advises Director is required to be disclosed. Nothing contained
in this Agreement limits the Director's ability to file a charge or complaint
with, communicate with (except with respect to information covered by 17
C.F.R. 240.21F-4(b)(4)(i) or 17 C.F.R. 240.21F-4(b)(4)(ii), which relate to
legal representation), or otherwise participate in any investigation or
proceeding that may be conducted by (i) the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (the "EEOC") or the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
or (ii) any other federal, state or local governmental agency or commission
that has jurisdiction over the Bank or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates
(the "Government Agencies") if and to the extent that it is not permitted by
applicable law to limit the Director's ability to file such a charge or
complaint with, communicate with, or otherwise participate in any
investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by such Government Agency;
in each such case, including by providing documents or other information,
without notice to the Bank or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. This
Agreement does not limit the Director's right to receive an award for
information provided to (1) the SEC or (2) the EEOC or any other Government
Agency, if and to the extent that it is not permissible by law to limit the
Director's right to receive an award for information provided to the EEOC or
such other Government Agency. In addition, pursuant to the Defend Trade
Secrets Act of 2016, the Director understands that an individual may not be
held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law
for the disclosure of a trade secret that (i) is made (A) in confidence to a
federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or
to an attorney; and (B) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a
suspected violation of law; or (ii) is made in a complaint or other document
that is filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding. Further, an
individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a
suspected violation of law may disclose the employer\'s trade secrets to the
attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding if the
individual (y) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and
(z) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

 

(ii)Except as expressly provided on Schedule I to this Agreement, for a period
beginning at the Effective Time and ending two (2) years after the Effective
Time, Director will not (except on behalf of or with the prior written consent
of CenterState), on Director's own behalf or in the service or on behalf of
others, solicit or attempt to solicit any customer of CenterState, CenterState
Bank, Charter or CharterBank (each a "Protected Party"), including known
actively sought prospective customers of CharterBank as of the Effective Time,
for the purpose of providing products or services that are Competitive (as
hereinafter defined) with those offered or provided by any Protected Party.

 

(iii)Except as expressly provided on Schedule I to this Agreement, for a
period beginning at the Effective Time and ending two (2) years after the
Effective Time, Director will not (except on behalf of or with the prior
written consent of CenterState), either directly or indirectly, on Director's
own behalf or in the service or on behalf of others, act as a director,
manager, officer or employee of any business which is the same as or
essentially the same as the business conducted by any Protected Party and
which has an office located within the Restricted Territory (as hereinafter
defined).

 

2

   

(iv)For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending two (2) years
after the Effective Time, Director will not on Director's own behalf or in the
service or on behalf of others, solicit or recruit or attempt to solicit or
recruit, directly or by assisting others, any employee of any Protected Party,
whether or not such employee is a full-time employee, whether or not such
employment is pursuant to a written agreement, and whether or not such
employment is for a determined period or is at will, to cease working for such
Protected Party; provided that the foregoing will not prevent the placement of
any general solicitation for employment not specifically directed towards
employees of any Protected Party or hiring any such person as a result
thereof.

 

(c)For purposes of this Section 1, the following terms shall be defined as set
forth below:

 

(i)"Competitive," with respect to particular products or services, shall mean
products or services that are the same as or substantially similar to the
products or services of any Protected Party.

 

(ii)"Confidential Information" shall mean data and information:

 

(A)relating to the business of Charter and its subsidiaries, including
CharterBank, or the business of CenterState or its subsidiaries, including
CenterState Bank, regardless of whether the data or information constitutes a
Trade Secret;

 

(B)disclosed to Director or of which Director became aware as a consequence of
Director's relationship with Charter and/or CharterBank;

 

(C)having value to Charter and/or CharterBank and, as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
CenterState and CenterState Bank; and

 

(D)not generally known to competitors of Charter or CenterState.

 

Confidential Information shall include Trade Secrets (as hereinafter defined),
methods of operation, names of customers, price lists, financial information
and projections, personnel data and similar information; provided, however,
that the terms "Confidential Information" and "Trade Secrets" shall not mean
data or information that (x) has been disclosed to the public, except where
such public disclosure has been made by Director without authorization from
Charter or CenterState, (y) has been independently developed and disclosed by
others, or (z) has otherwise entered the public domain through lawful means.

 

(iii)"Restricted Territory" shall mean each county in Florida, Georgia, or
Alabama where CharterBank operates a banking office at the Effective Time and
each county contiguous to each of such counties.

 

(iv)"Trade Secrets" shall mean information, without regard to form, including
technical or nontechnical data, formulas, patterns, compilations, programs,
devices, methods, techniques, drawings, processes, financial data, financial
plans, product plans or a list of actual or potential customers or suppliers,
that is not commonly known by or available to the public and which
information:

 

3

   

(A)derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known
to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who
can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and

 

(B)is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to
maintain its secrecy.

 

(d)Director acknowledges that irreparable loss and injury would result to
CenterState upon the breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section
1 and that damages arising out of such breach would be difficult to ascertain.
Director hereby agrees that, in addition to all other remedies provided at law
or in equity, CenterState may petition and obtain from a court of law or
equity, without the necessity of proving actual damages and without posting
any bond or other security, both temporary and permanent injunctive relief to
prevent a breach by Director of any covenant contained in this Section 1, and
shall be entitled to an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits and
other benefits arising out of any such breach. In the event that the
provisions of this Section 1 should ever be determined to exceed the time,
geographic or other limitations permitted by applicable law, then such
provisions shall be modified so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent
permitted by law. If such provision(s) cannot be modified to be enforceable,
the provision(s) shall be severed from this Agreement to the extent
unenforceable. The remaining provisions and any partially enforceable
provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

 

2.Term; Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time by the
written consent of the parties hereto, and this Agreement shall be
automatically terminated upon the earlier of (a) termination of the Merger
Agreement, (b) two (2) years following the Effective Time, or (c) upon a
Change in Control of CenterState. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions
of Section 1 shall only become operative upon the consummation of the Merger
but, in such event, shall survive the consummation of the Merger until the
earlier of two (2) years after the Effective Time or a Change in Control of
CenterState. Upon termination of this Agreement, no party shall have any
further obligations or liabilities hereunder, except that termination of this
Agreement will not relieve a breaching party from liability for any breach of
any provision of this Agreement occurring prior to the termination of this
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control of
CenterState" means (a) any person or group of persons within the meaning of
§13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, becomes the
beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 50% or more of the (1)
outstanding voting securities of CenterState or CenterState Bank, or (2) the
assets of CenterState or CenterState Bank, taken as a whole, or (b)
individuals serving on the board of directors of CenterState as of the
Effective Time cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the
board of directors of CenterState (the "Incumbent Board"), provided that any
person becoming a director subsequent to the Effective Time whose election was
approved by a vote of at least three-quarters of the directors comprising the
Incumbent Board, or whose nomination for election by CenterState's
shareholders was approved by the nominating committee serving under an
Incumbent Board, shall be considered a member of the Incumbent Board.

 

3.Notices. Any notice, consent, demand, request or other communication given
to a party hereto in connection with this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be deemed to have been given to such party (a) when delivered personally
to such party or (b) provided that a written acknowledgment of receipt is
obtained, five (5) days after being sent by prepaid certified or registered
mail, or (c) two (2) days after being sent by a nationally recognized
overnight courier, to the address (if any) specified below for such party (or
to such other address as such party shall have specified by ten (10) days'
advance notice given in accordance with this Section 3).

of Charter or any of its subsidiaries, and in consideration of the premises
and the mutual covenants contained herein and in the Merger Agreement, the
mutual benefits to be derived hereunder and thereunder, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged,
the undersigned, intending to be legally bound, hereby agrees as follows:

 

1.Definitions. Unless otherwise defined in this letter, capitalized terms used
in this letter have the meanings given to them in the Merger Agreement. For
purposes of this letter, Charter and each of its subsidiaries are individually
referred to as a "Charter Entity" and collectively, as the "Charter Entities".

 

2.Release of Certain Claims.

 

(a)The undersigned hereby releases and forever discharges, effective upon the
consummation of the Merger under the Merger Agreement, each Charter Entity,
and its respective directors and officers (in their capacities as such), and
their respective successors and assigns, and each of them (individually and
collectively, the "Released Parties") of and from any and all liabilities,
claims, demands, debts, accounts, covenants, agreements, obligations, costs,
expenses, actions or causes of action of every nature, character or
description (collectively, "Claims"), which the undersigned, solely in his
capacity as an officer, director or employee of any Charter Entity, has or
claims to have, or previously had or claimed to have, in each case as of the
Effective Time, against any of the Released Parties, whether or not in law,
equity or otherwise, based in whole or in part on any facts, conduct,
activities, transactions, events or occurrences known or unknown, matured or
unmatured, contingent or otherwise (individually, a "Released Claim," and
collectively, the "Released Claims"), except for (i) compensation for services
that have accrued but not yet been paid in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice or other contract rights relating to severance,

disclosed in writing to CenterState on or prior to the date of the Merger
Agreement, and (ii) the items listed in Section 2(b) below.

 

(b)For avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Released
Claims do not include any of the following:

 

(i)any Claims that the undersigned may have in any capacity other than as an

of any Charter Entity;

 

(ii)the Claims excluded in (i) and (ii) of Section 2(a) above;

 

(iii) any Claims that the undersigned may have under the Merger Agreement;

 

(iv)any Claims that, under applicable law, the undersigned cannot hereby
release and discharge;

 

(iv) any right to indemnification that the undersigned may have under the
articles of incorporation or bylaws of any Charter Entity, Maryland law, or
the Merger Agreement; or

 

(v)any rights or Claims listed on Schedule I to this Agreement.

 

3.Forbearance. The undersigned shall forever refrain and forebear from
commencing, instituting or prosecuting any lawsuit, action, claim or
proceeding before or in any court, regulatory, governmental, arbitral or other
authority to collect or enforce any Released Claims which are released and
discharged hereby.

 

4.Miscellaneous.

 

(a)This letter shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Florida (without regard for the conflicts of law principles
thereof).

 

(b)This letter contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Released Claims released hereby, and this letter supersedes all prior
agreements, arrangement or understandings (written or otherwise) with respect
to such Released Claims and no representation or warranty, oral or written,
express or implied, has been made by or relied upon by any party hereto,
except as expressly contained herein or in the Merger Agreement.

 

(c) In the event that any one or more provisions of this letter shall for any
reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by any court
of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provisions of this letter, and the parties shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to substitute a valid, legal and
enforceable provision which, insofar as practical, implements the purpose and
intents of this letter. 

 

(d)This letter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
undersigned and the Released Parties and their respective heirs, legal
representatives, successors and assigns.

 

(e)This letter may not be modified, amended or rescinded except by the written
agreement of the undersigned and the Released Parties, it being the express
understanding of the undersigned and the Released Parties that no term hereof
may be waived by the action, inaction or course of delaying by or between the
undersigned or the Released Parties, except in strict accordance with this
paragraph, and further that the waiver of any breach of this letter shall not
constitute or be construed as the waiver of any other breach of the terms
hereof.

 

2

   

(f)The undersigned represents, warrants and covenants that the undersigned is
fully aware of the undersigned's rights to discuss any and all aspects of this
matter with any attorney chosen by him or her, and that the undersigned has
carefully read and fully understands all the provisions of this letter, and
that the undersigned is voluntarily entering into this letter.

 

(g)This letter shall become effective upon the consummation of the Merger, and
its operation to extinguish all of the Released Claims released hereby is not
dependent on or affected by the performance or non-performance of any future
act by the undersigned or the Released Parties (other than the failure of
CenterState to pay the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement). If
the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason, this letter shall be of no
force or effect.

 

(h)If any civil action, arbitration or other legal proceeding is brought for
the enforcement of this letter, or because of an alleged dispute, breach,
default or misrepresentation in connection with any provision of this letter,
the successful or prevailing party or parties shall be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, sales and use taxes and all expenses
even if not taxable as court costs (including, without limitation, all such
fees, taxes, costs and expenses incident to arbitration, appellate, bankruptcy
and post‑judgment proceedings), incurred in that proceeding, in addition to
any other relief to which such party or parties may be entitled. Attorneys'
fees shall include, without limitation, paralegal fees, investigative fees,
administrative costs, sales and use taxes and all other charges billed by the
attorney to the prevailing party (including any fees and costs associated with
collecting such amounts).

 

(i)IN ANY CIVIL ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM, PROCEEDING, OR LITIGATION, WHETHER AT
LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHICH ARISES OUT OF, CONCERNS, OR RELATES TO THIS CLAIMS
LETTER, ANY AND ALL TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS CLAIMS LETTER, THE
PERFORMANCE OF THIS CLAIMS LETTER, OR THE RELATIONSHIP CREATED BY THIS CLAIMS
LETTER, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE,
TRIAL SHALL BE TO A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION AND NOT TO A JURY. EACH
PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY. ANY
PARTY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS CLAIMS LETTER WITH
ANY COURT, AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THIS CLAIMS
LETTER OF THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. NEITHER PARTY HAS MADE
OR RELIED UPON ANY ORAL REPRESENTATIONS TO OR BY ANY OTHER PARTY REGARDING THE
ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION. EACH PARTY HAS READ AND UNDERSTANDS THE
EFFECT OF THIS JURY WAIVER PROVISION. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN
ADVISED BY ITS OWN COUNSEL WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSACTIONS GOVERNED BY THIS
CLAIMS LETTER AND SPECIFICALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION.

 

(j)The parties acknowledge that a substantial portion of the negotiations,
anticipated performance and execution of this letter occurred or shall occur
in Polk County, Florida. Any civil action, counterclaim, proceeding, or
litigation arising out of or relating to this letter shall be brought solely
and exclusively in the courts of record of the State of Florida in Polk County
or the United States District Court, Middle District of Florida. Each party
consents to the jurisdiction of such Florida court in any such civil action,
counterclaim, proceeding, or litigation and waives any objection to the laying
of venue of any such civil action, counterclaim, proceeding, or litigation in

STOCK OPTION LOCK-UP AGREEMENT

 

This Option Lock-Up Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into as of the
24th day of April, 2018, by and between CenterState Bank Corporation, a
Florida corporation ("CenterState"), and the undersigned holder (the "Option
Holder") of options to acquire ("Charter Stock Options") from Charter shares
of Charter Common Stock (as defined herein).

 

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Option Holder holds and has the sole
authority to exercise (subject to vesting and other applicable requirements)
vested and unvested stock options to acquire from Charter the aggregate number
of shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Charter Common
Stock"), of Charter Financial Corporation a Maryland corporation ("Charter"),
indicated on the signature page of this Agreement under the heading "Total
Number of Shares of Charter Common Stock Subject to Stock Options" (the
"Charter Stock Options");

 

WHEREAS, CenterState and Charter propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to
which, among other things, Charter will merge with and into CenterState (the
"Merger"); capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have
the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of CenterState to enter into the
Merger Agreement, the Option Holder is executing this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of, and as a material inducement to,
CenterState entering into the Merger Agreement and proceeding with the
transactions contemplated thereby, which include, among other things, the
cancellation of Charter Stock Options for a cash payment pursuant to Section
2.02(a) of the Merger Agreement in connection with the consummation of the
Merger, and in consideration of the expenses incurred and to be incurred by
CenterState in connection therewith, the Option Holder and CenterState,
intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

 

1.Limitation on Exercise of Stock Options. While this Agreement is in effect,
the Option Holder shall not exercise any Charter Stock Options in a manner
that would result in more than 50% of the shares of Charter Common Stock
subject to such Charter Stock Options as of the date of this Agreement (as set
forth on the signature page of this Agreement under the heading "Total Number
of Shares of Charter Common Stock Subject to Stock Options") being issued to
such Option Holder without the prior written consent of CenterState.

 

2.No Transfers. While this Agreement is in effect, the Option Holder agrees
not to, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise
dispose of, or enter into any contract, option, commitment or other
arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge,
assignment or other disposition of, any Charter Stock Options, except as
CenterState may otherwise permit in writing in its sole discretion. Any
transfer or other disposition in violation of the terms of this Section 2
shall be null and void. 

 

3.Representations and Warranties of The Option Holder. The Option Holder
represents and warrants to and agrees with CenterState as follows:

 

1

   



 

    



 |  

(a)

 |  

The Option Holder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter into and
perform his or her obligations under this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(b)

 |  

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Option Holder, and
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by CenterState,
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the Option Holder
enforceable against the Option Holder in accordance with its terms, except as
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors generally and subject to general principles
of equity. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(c)

 |  

The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Option Holder does not,
and the performance by the Option Holder of his or her obligations hereunder
and the consummation by the Option Holder of the transactions contemplated
hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under, any
agreement, instrument, contract or other obligation or any order, arbitration
award, judgment or decree to which the Option Holder is a party or by which
the Option Holder is bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which the
Option Holder is subject. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(d)

 |  

The Option Holder is the direct owner of the Charter Stock Options. 

---|---|--- 

 

4.Specific Performance; Remedies; Attorneys' Fees. The Option Holder
acknowledges that it is a condition to the willingness of CenterState to enter
into the Merger Agreement that the Option Holder execute and deliver this
Agreement and that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to
CenterState if the Option Holder fails to comply with the obligations imposed
by this Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure, CenterState will
not have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the Option Holder agrees
that injunctive relief or other equitable relief is the appropriate remedy for
any such failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis
that CenterState has an adequate remedy at law. In addition, after notice to
the Option Holder, CenterState shall have the right to inform any third party
that CenterState reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating,
participating with the Option Holder or receiving from the Option Holder
assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and
of the rights of CenterState hereunder, and that participation by any such
third party with the Option Holder in activities in violation of the Option
Holder's agreement with CenterState set forth in this Agreement may give rise
to claims by CenterState against such third party. All expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses.

 

5.Term of Agreement; Termination. The term of this Agreement shall commence
on the date hereof. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by the
written consent of the parties hereto, and this Agreement shall be
automatically terminated upon the earliest to occur of: (a) termination of the
Merger Agreement, (b) the consummation of the Merger, or (c) one (1) year from
the date hereof. Upon such termination, no party shall have any further
obligations or liabilities hereunder; provided, however, that such termination
shall not relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement
prior to such termination.

 

6.Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or modified, and no provision hereof may be modified or waived,
except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of
any provision hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other
provision hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a
continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party. 

 

2

   



 

7.Severability. In the event that any one or more provisions of this
Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Agreement, and the parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as
practical, implements the purpose and intents of this Agreement. 

 

8.Capacity as Option Holder. This Agreement shall apply to the Option Holder
solely in his, her or its capacity as a holder of options to acquire shares of
Charter Common Stock, and it shall not apply in any manner to the Option
Holder in any capacity as a director, officer or employee of Charter or in any
other capacity. For avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree
that nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the Option Holder or
any of his or her or Affiliates who is or becomes during the term hereof a
member of the board of directors or an officer of Charter or CharterBank from
acting, omitting to act or refraining from taking any action, solely in such
person's capacity as a member of the board of directors or as an officer of
Charter or CharterBank consistent with his or her fiduciary duties in such
capacity under applicable law, including under Section 5.09 of the Merger
Agreement.

 

9.Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to any
applicable conflicts of law principles or any other principle that could
require the application of the law of any other jurisdiction. The sole and
exclusive venue for any civil action, counterclaim, proceeding, or litigation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be the courts of record of
the State of Florida in Polk County or the United States District Court,
Middle District of Florida. Each party consents to the jurisdiction of such
Florida courts in any such civil action, counterclaim, proceeding, or
litigation and waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such civil
action, counterclaim, proceeding, or litigation in such Florida courts.
Service of any court paper may be effected on such party by mail, as provided
in this Agreement, or in such other manner as may be provided under applicable
laws, rules of procedure or local rules.

 

10.WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.
EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.

 

11.Further Assurances. The Option Holder agrees not to commence or
participate in, and to take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in
any class action with respect to, any claim, derivative or otherwise, against
CenterState, Charter or any of their respective successors relating to the
negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement
or the consummation of the Merger. From time to time prior to the termination
of this Agreement, at CenterState's request and without further consideration,
the Option Holder shall execute and deliver such additional documents and take
all such further action as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to effect
the actions and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

3

   



 

12.Disclosure. To the extent such information is required to be included, the
Option Holder hereby permits CenterState to publish and disclose in the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus and Registration Statement (including, without
limitation, all related documents and schedules filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission) his or her identity and ownership of shares of Charter
Stock Options and the nature of the Option Holder's commitments, arrangements
and understandings pursuant to this Agreement.

 

13.Notices. Any notice, consent, demand, request or other communication given
to a party hereto in connection with this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be deemed to have been given to such party (i) when delivered personally
to such party, or (ii) provided that a written acknowledgment of receipt is
obtained, five (5) days after being sent by prepaid certified or registered
mail, or (iii) two (2) days after being sent by a nationally recognized
overnight courier, to the address (if any) specified below for such party (or
