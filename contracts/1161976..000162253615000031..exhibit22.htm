Indemnification Procedures.   (i) If a Buyer Indemnitee or a Seller Indemnitee (each, an &#8220;Indemnified Entity&#8221;)   believes that a Claim, demand or other circumstance exists that has given or may reasonably be expected   to give rise to a right of indemnification under this Article 8 (whether or not the amount of Losses relating   thereto is then quantifiable), such Indemnified Entity shall assert its Claim for indemnification by giving   written notice thereof (a &#8220;Claim Notice&#8221;) to the party from which indemnification is sought (the   &#8220;Indemnifying Party&#8221;) as promptly as reasonably possible but in any event, (a) if the event or occurrence   giving rise to such Claim for indemnification is, or relates to, a Claim, brought by a Person not a party to   this Agreement or affiliated with any such Indemnified Entity (a &#8220;Third Party,&#8221; and such Claim, a &#8220;Third   Party Claim&#8221;), within ten (10) Business Days following receipt of notice of such Claim by such   Indemnified Entity, or (b) if the event or occurrence giving rise to such Claim for indemnification is not,   or does not relate to, a Claim brought by a Third Party, within thirty (30) days after the discovery by the   Indemnified Entity of the circumstances giving rise to such Claim for indemnity. Each Claim Notice shall   describe the Claim in reasonable detail, including the nature of, and factual and legal basis for, any such   Claim for indemnification, and the provisions of this Agreement upon which such Claim for   indemnification is made. The failure by the Indemnified Entity to timely notify the Indemnifying Party   shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligation hereunder except to the extent   that the defense of such Claim is materially prejudiced by the failure to give such timely notice. After   delivery of the Claim Notice, the Indemnified Entity shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within ten   (10) Business Days after the Indemnified Entity&#8217;s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents   (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Entity relating to the Third Party Claim.   (ii) If any Claim by an Indemnified Entity under this Article 8 relates to a Claim filed   or made against an Indemnified Entity by a Third Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to   participate in the defense thereof and may elect at any time to negotiate a settlement or a compromise of   such Claim or to defend such Claim with its own counsel. Should an Indemnifying Party elect to assume   the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Entity   for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Entity in connection with the defense   thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Entity shall have the right to   participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel   employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall   control such defense; provided that, with respect to any matter which, in the written opinion of the   Indemnified Entity&#8217;s counsel, there is a material conflict of interest between the Indemnified Entity and   the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Entity shall be entitled to control such defense, to the extent of   the matter giving rise to such conflict and subject to the Indemnifying Party&#8217;s right to participate in such   defense.

Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon   the Indemnifying Party&#8217;s request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of all records and information   reasonably available to such Indemnified Entity relating to such Claim, and making such Persons   available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any   material provided hereunder. The party in charge of the defense shall keep the other Parties fully apprised   at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. In the event   the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of (or otherwise elects to negotiate or settle or compromise) a   Third Party Claim as described above, the Indemnified Entity shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for   all costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with such defense (or   negotiation, settlement or compromise) to the extent, if applicable, that such costs and expenses either (i)   do not exceed the amount of the remaining Deductible or (ii) exceed the Cap.   8E. General.   (i) The amount of any and all Losses under this Article 8 shall be determined net of   any amounts recovered or for which there is a right of recovery by an Indemnified Entity or its Affiliates   under or pursuant to any insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement arrangement or Contract.   (ii) The Buyer Indemnitees shall, and shall cause their Affiliates and respective   Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with Seller and to take all commercially reasonable actions to   avoid, minimize and mitigate Losses that would otherwise be subject to indemnification under Section   8B, including with respect to claims for indemnity under Section 8B(i)(a) for breach of the   representations and warranties included in Section 4K including not undertaking, nor soliciting nor   importuning any Governmental Entity or other Person to require or undertake, any environmental   sampling, correction, investigation, monitoring or remediation unless affirmatively required to do so by   applicable Environmental Laws in effect as of the Closing Date. In addition to any other limitations on   indemnification that may apply, with respect to any Claim for indemnification that any of the Buyer   Indemnitees may assert regarding Environmental Laws, Seller shall not have any obligation with respect   to such Claim to the extent the Losses for which indemnification are sought (a) relate to a breach of   obligations under this Section 8E(ii), (b) arise out of any action to meet a cleanup or remedial standard   under Environmental Law that is more stringent or costly than the minimum standard applicable as of the   Closing Date for the continued use of the relevant property or facility as it was used as of the Closing   Date or which does not employ any available risk-based standards or institutional controls or (c) are   ordinary costs of any post-Closing decommissioning, construction, demolition or renovation of any asset   of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   (iii) Intentionally deleted.   (iv) If on or before the Closing Date a Party has actual knowledge of the existence of   Claims or other events or occurrences for which it or its officers, directors, employees or Affiliates would   be entitled to indemnification under this Article 8, such Party shall notify the other Parties of such Claims   or other events or occurrences prior to the Closing.   (v) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing (except for   disputes under Section 2C, which disputes will be resolved in accordance with the dispute mechanism set   forth in Section 2C, indemnification under Section 6P, Buyer&#8217;s responsibility pursuant to Section 6L(iv),   indemnification under Section 6C, indemnification under Section 6M and the obtaining of injunctive or   other equitable relief as provided in Section 10P), its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and   all Claims, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws or otherwise (including any Claims   arising under any Environmental Laws), relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and the     </FONT></DIV>

The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed   severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or   enforceability of the other provisions hereof.   10C. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,   each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall, taken together, be considered one and   the same Agreement.

Third-Party Beneficiaries and Obligations. This Agreement shall inure to the   benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing   in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the   Parties or their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights, remedies or liabilities under or by   reason of this Agreement, other than sections which are specifically for the benefit of the Seller Group,   the Indemnified D&amp;O Parties and the Released Persons as applicable (including under Section 6D,   Section 6E, Section 8A, Section 8C, Section 6P, Section 6Q and this Section 10E, as applicable), each of   which is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby or to be paid thereunder and may be   enforced by such Persons. The Parties further agree that the rights of third-party beneficiaries shall not   arise unless and until the Closing occurs. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the   product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in   such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with this   Agreement without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and   warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with   particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the   Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of   actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.   10F. Governing Law.

(iii) In connection with Buyer&#8217;s investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries,   Buyer has received, directly or indirectly, through its Affiliates or Representatives, from or on behalf of   Seller or its Affiliates or Representatives, certain projections, including projected statements of operating   revenues, income from operations and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and the business   transactions and events underlying such statements) and certain business plan information, projections,   presentations, predictions, calculations, estimates and forecasts of the Company and its Subsidiaries and   other similar data. Buyer, on behalf of itself and all Buyer Parties, acknowledges and agrees that there are   uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans, statements,   predictions, presentations, calculations and other similar data, that Buyer is well aware of such   uncertainties, that Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and   accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans, statements, calculations, presentations, predictions   and other similar data so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such   estimates, projections, forecasts, plans, statements, calculations, predictions and other similar data), and   that neither Buyer, nor any Buyer Party, shall have any Claim under any circumstances against Seller or   any other Person with respect thereto or arising therefrom. Accordingly, Seller makes no representations   or warranties whatsoever to Buyer or any other Person, and expressly disclaims all liability and   responsibility, in each case with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans, statements,   calculations, presentations, predictions and other similar data (including the reasonableness of the   assumptions underlying such projections, forecasts, plans, statements, calculations, presentations,   predictions and other similar data) or with respect to (a) the performance or success of the Company and   its Subsidiaries at any time after the date hereof, and no such Person shall be entitled to rely on such   estimates, projections, forecasts, plans, statements, calculations, presentations, predictions and other   similar data for any purpose, including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this   Agreement and (b) the possibility or likelihood of the occurrence of any environmental condition, release   or hazard, or any mechanical or technical issue, problem, or failure, or of any interruption in service, or of   any increase, decrease or plateau in the volume of product or service, or revenue derived therefrom, or of   the possibility, likelihood or potential outcome of any complaints, controversies or disputes with respect   to existing or future customers or suppliers, in each case, related to the Company, its Subsidiaries or their   respective assets.   10O. Payments under Agreement. Each Party agrees that all amounts required to be   paid hereunder shall be paid in United States currency and, except as otherwise expressly set forth in this   Agreement, without discount, rebate or reduction and subject to no counterclaim or offset (other than   withholding Tax obligations required to be withheld by Law), on the dates specified herein (with time   being of the essence).   10P. Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in   the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is   otherwise breached or threatened to be breached and that an award of money damages would be   inadequate in such event. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that the Parties and the third party beneficiaries   of this Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable   relief, without proof of actual damages, including an injunction or injunctions or orders for specific   performance to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of   this Agreement (including any order sought by Seller to cause Buyer to perform its agreements and   covenants contained in this Agreement). Each Party further agrees (i) that no other Party or any other   Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as   a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 10P and each Party irrevocably waives any   right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument     </FONT></DIV>

Each Party further agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any   action for equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or threatened breach of this   Agreement. The Parties agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance or other equitable relief   is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of   monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the Parties otherwise have an adequate   remedy at Law. If, on or prior to the Outside Date, any Party brings any action to enforce specifically the   performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other Party, the Outside Date shall automatically   be extended (x) for the period during which such action is pending, plus ten (10) Business Days or (y) by   such other time period established by the court presiding over such action, as the case may be.   10Q. No Partnership Created. Nothing in this Agreement (including Section 6A or   Section 6B) is intended to give Buyer, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company&#8217;s   or its Subsidiaries&#8217; operations prior to the Closing and, without limiting its obligations under this   Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall exercise complete control over their respective   operations. Furthermore, in no event shall this Agreement be deemed to create a partnership between   Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates, on the other hand, and in no   event shall any fiduciary or similar duty be deemed owed by Seller or any of its Affiliates to Buyer or any   of its Affiliates.   10R.
