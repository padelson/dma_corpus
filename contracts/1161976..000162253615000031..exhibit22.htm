TransCanada Facility USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"). Unless

A attached hereto. WHEREAS, Seller owns 100% of the issued and outstanding
membership interests in Talen Ironwood Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited

conditions of this Agreement; WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, TransCanada Energy USA, Inc. and TransCanada

Seller a Limited Guarantee, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B-2,
dated as of the date hereof, pursuant to which the Guarantors have guaranteed
the payment of all obligations of Buyer under this Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE,
in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements in this Agreement and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the Parties intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE 1
DEFINITIONS 1A. Definitions. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement have the
meanings ascribed to them by definition in this Agreement or in Exhibit A
hereto. The definitions on Exhibit A are incorporated into this Agreement as
if fully set forth herein and all references to a section in such Exhibit A
are references to such section of this Agreement. 1B. Usage. (i) Whenever the
words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." (ii) Words
denoting any gender shall include all genders (including the neutral gender).
Where a word is defined herein, references to the singular shall include
references to the plural and vice versa. (iii) A reference to any Party to
this Agreement or any other agreement or document shall include such Party's
successors and permitted assigns. (iv) All references to "$" and dollars shall
be deemed to refer to United States currency unless otherwise specifically  

   

 ![](exhibitpurchaseandsaleag006.jpg) 

\- 2 - (v) All references to a day or days shall be deemed to refer to a
calendar day or calendar days, as applicable, unless otherwise specifically
provided. (vi) Any reference to any agreement or contract referenced herein or
in the Company Disclosure Letter shall be a reference to such agreement or
contract, as amended, modified, supplemented or waived from time to time.
(vii) The phrase "to the extent" means "the degree by which" and not "if".
(viii) All references to an Article, Section or Exhibit shall be deemed to
refer to such Article, Section or Exhibit of this Agreement, unless otherwise
specified. The terms "hereof," "herein," "hereunder" and derivative words
refer to this entire Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires. The
words "either," "or," "neither," "nor" and "any" are not exclusive. (ix) For
the purpose of calculating any amount hereunder, the Parties shall use
applicable currency exchange rates as in effect as of the close of business on
the Closing Date, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, with all amounts
converted into United States dollars as of such date. ARTICLE 2 PURCHASE AND
SALE 2A. Purchase and Sale of the Seller Interests. (i) In accordance with the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Closing, Buyer shall purchase and acquire from Seller, and Seller shall sell,
transfer, convey, assign and deliver to Buyer, all of the Seller Interests, in
each case free and clear of any Liens, other than Liens arising under
applicable securities Laws (the "Purchase"), in consideration of the payment
of the Closing Purchase Price as adjusted by the Adjustment Amount pursuant to
Section 2C(iii) and the other provisions of this Agreement. (ii) The aggregate
purchase price (the "Closing Purchase Price") payable at the Closing for the
Seller Interests shall be an amount equal to: (a) $654,000,000 (the "Base
Purchase Price"), plus (c) the amount (if any) by which the Estimated Closing
Net Working Capital exceeds the Targeted Net Working Capital, minus (d) the
amount (if any) by which the Targeted Net Working Capital exceeds the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, plus (e) the Estimated Closing Cash,
without deduction or withholding of any kind. (iii) The Parties intend that
the Purchase of the Seller Interests contemplated herein be treated as a sale
of the assets, and assumption of the liabilities, of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for U.S. federal income Tax purposes. Within one hundred and
twenty (120) days after the Closing, Buyer shall provide to Seller an
allocation of the Closing Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to Section 2C,
together with any other amounts properly includable in the purchase price for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes, among the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the "Purchase Price Allocation"). The Purchase Price Allocation
shall be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder. In the event that any adjustment
to the Closing Purchase Price occurs pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
Buyer shall provide to Seller a revised Purchase Price Allocation prepared in
accordance with this Section 2A(iii). None of Buyer, Seller, the Company, the
Subsidiaries of the Company or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall
take, or permit any Affiliate to take, any position for any Tax purpose
(whether in connection with audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with the final Purchase Price Allocation, as revised from time to
time as finally determined in accordance with Section 6M(vii), except as
required pursuant to a "determination" within  

   

 ![](exhibitpurchaseandsaleag007.jpg) 

\- 3 - the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of
state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law). 2B. Delivery of Estimated Closing
Statement. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
will prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement and worksheet setting forth
Seller's good faith estimate of: (i) Closing Cash (the "Estimated Closing
Cash"), (ii) Closing Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital") and (iii) the Closing Purchase Price resulting therefrom. 2C.
Purchase Price Adjustment. (i) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing
Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the "Closing
Statement") setting forth Buyer's calculation (together with reasonable
supporting detail of each such calculation) of the Closing Cash, Closing Net
Working Capital and the resulting Final Purchase Price. The Closing Statement
shall be prepared in accordance with the definitions in this Agreement. During
the sixty (60) days immediately following Seller's receipt of the Closing
Statement and any period of dispute thereafter with respect to such Closing
Statement, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to,
(a) assist Seller in the review of the Closing Statement and provide Seller
and its Representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to
the books, records (including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other
documents, and the right to make copies of such books and records), supporting
data, facilities and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
purposes of their review of the Closing Statement, and (b) cooperate with
Seller and its Representatives in connection with such review, including by
providing on a timely basis material other information necessary or useful in
connection with the review of the Closing Statement and access to the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' accountants and advisors. The Closing
Statement (including the Closing Cash, Closing Net Working Capital and Final
Purchase Price set forth thereon) shall become final and binding upon the
Parties sixty (60) days following Seller's receipt thereof unless Seller gives
written notice of its disagreement containing particulars of specific items
objected to (a "Notice of Disagreement") to Buyer prior to such date; provided
that the Closing Statement shall alternatively become final and binding upon
the Parties upon Seller's delivery, prior to the expiration of such sixty
(60)-day period, of written notice to Buyer of its acceptance of the Closing
Statement delivered by Buyer. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature and amount of any disagreement so asserted. (ii)
If a timely Notice of Disagreement is delivered by Seller, then the Closing
Statement (as revised in accordance with this Section 2C(ii)), and the Closing
Cash, Closing Net Working Capital and Final Purchase Price set forth thereon
shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the earlier of (a) the date
all matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement are finally resolved in
writing by Seller and Buyer and (b) the date all matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement not resolved in writing by Seller and Buyer are finally
resolved in writing by a nationally recognized accounting, consulting or
valuation firm (other than a so-called "Big Four" accounting firm) mutually
selected by Seller and Buyer (such firm, the "Arbiter", or absent such
agreement then upon written notice to the other Party, each Party shall each
have five (5) Business Days to select a nationally recognized accounting,
consulting or valuation firm (other than a so-called "Big-Four" accounting
firm) and such selected firms shall together select the Arbiter, and if any
Party does not select a such a firm, then the firm selected by the other Party
shall be the Arbiter) in accordance with this Section 2C(ii). The Closing
Statement shall be revised to the extent necessary to reflect any mutual
resolution in writing by Seller and Buyer and/or any final resolution made by
the Arbiter in accordance with this Section 2C(ii). During the thirty (30)
days immediately following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, or such
longer period as Seller and Buyer may agree in writing, Seller and Buyer shall
seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences which they may have
with respect to any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and all  

   

 ![](exhibitpurchaseandsaleag008.jpg) 

\- 4 - discussions related thereto shall (unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and
Seller) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (as in effect
as of the date of this Agreement) and any applicable similar state rule. At
the end of such thirty (30)-day period or such agreed-upon longer period,
Seller and Buyer shall submit to the Arbiter for review and resolution all
matters (but only such matters) which remain in dispute and which were
properly included in the Notice of Disagreement. The Parties shall instruct
the Arbiter to, and the Arbiter shall, make a final determination of the items
included in the Closing Statement (to the extent such amounts are in dispute)
in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement
(which final determination shall be requested by the Parties to be delivered
not more than thirty (30) days following submission of such disputed matters),
and such determination by the Arbiter shall be final and binding and shall not
be subject to court review or otherwise appealable. Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate with the Arbiter during the term of its engagement. Seller and Buyer
shall instruct the Arbiter not to, and the Arbiter shall not, assign a value
to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item assigned
by Seller or Buyer or less than the smallest value for such item assigned by
Seller or Buyer. Seller and Buyer shall also instruct the Arbiter to, and the
Arbiter shall, make its determination based solely on presentations and
written materials submitted by Seller and Buyer to the Arbiter (with
substantially simultaneous delivery to the other Party) that are in accordance
with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on
the basis of an independent review). The fees and expenses of the Arbiter
pursuant to this Section 2C(ii) shall be paid by Buyer, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand, in relation to the proportional difference between
the Arbiter's final determination of the Final Purchase Price and each of
Buyer's and Seller's initial position as to Final Purchase Price, as
applicable. The Closing Statement shall be revised to the extent necessary to
reflect any mutual resolution in writing by Seller and Buyer and/or any final
resolution made by the Arbiter in accordance with this Section 2C(ii). The
"Adjustment Finalization Date" shall refer to the date the Closing Statement
becomes final and binding on the Parties pursuant to this Section 2C. (iii) If
the Closing Purchase Price is less than the Final Purchase Price (such
shortfall, the "Adjustment Amount"), then, subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Agreement, within five (5) Business Days after the
Adjustment Finalization Date, Buyer shall pay by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to Seller the Adjustment Amount, together with interest
thereon pursuant to Section 2C(v). (iv) If the Closing Purchase Price is
greater than the Final Purchase Price (such shortfall, the "Excess Amount"),
then, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, within five
(5) Business Days after the Adjustment Finalization Date, Seller shall pay by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to Buyer the Excess Amount,
together with interest thereon pursuant to Section 2C(v). (v) Any payment
pursuant to Section 2C(iii) or Section 2C(iv) shall be made together with
interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest most
recently published by the Wall Street Journal as the "prime rate" at large
U.S. money center banks on the Closing Date, calculated on the basis of the
number of days elapsed from the Closing Date to the date of payment. (vi)
Buyer agrees that (a) the payment of the Excess Amount (if any) in accordance
with Section 2C(iv) and (b) the working capital adjustment, and cash
adjustment provided for in this Section 2C, and the dispute resolution
provisions provided for in this Section 2C, shall be the exclusive remedies
for the matters addressed or that could be addressed by this Section 2C. (vii)
Buyer agrees that following the Closing it will not, and it will cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries not to, take any actions with respect to the
accounting books, records, policies and procedures of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that would obstruct or prevent the preparation of the Closing
Statement as provided in this Section 2C.

remedies for the matters addressed or that could be addressed by this Section
2C. (ix) On the date which is 5 Business Days after the later of (a) the date

or turned over to Talen Ironwood, LLC under the Amended and Restated
Collateral Agency Agreement or Ironwood Indenture, as applicable, and (b) the

Residual Reserve Amount. (x) On the date which is 5 Business Days after the
later of (a) the date the amounts held in the Project Accounts (other than the

to pay to Seller, the Excess Project Account Amount (if any) paid by Seller
pursuant to Section 6O(viii). (xi) Buyer shall take (or cause the Company or
its Subsidiaries to take) all such actions and exercise all such rights
available to the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Buyer under the Ironwood
Indenture, the Amended and Restated Collateral Agency Agreement and/or the
other Financing Documents (as such term is defined in the Ironwood Indenture)
to cause the Collateral Agent, the Trustee (as such term is defined under the
Amended and Restated Collateral Agency Agreement) and the Depositary Bank (as
such term is defined under the Amended and Restated Collateral Agency
Agreement) to assign, transfer and turn over the Residual Reserve Amount and

legally binding obligation of Seller enforceable against Seller in accordance

and other Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and as limited by the
availability of specific performance and the application of equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). 3C. Legal

all necessary action on the part of Buyer. This Agreement constitutes
(assuming the due execution and delivery by Seller) a valid and legally
binding obligation of Buyer enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its
terms, except as limited by the application of bankruptcy, moratorium and
other Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and as limited by the
availability of specific performance and the application of equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). 5C. Legal
Proceedings. There are no Claims pending or, to Buyer's knowledge, threatened
in writing, against Buyer before any Governmental Entity that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
material adverse effect on Buyer's ability to perform its obligations
hereunder. Buyer is not subject to any Order that prohibits the consummation
of the Purchase or would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a material adverse effect on Buyer's ability to perform
its obligations hereunder. 5D. Noncontravention. Assuming receipt of the HSR
Approval and the Governmental Authorizations set forth on Exhibit D, the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Buyer do not, and the
consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, (i)
contravene or violate any provision of the Organizational Documents of Buyer,
or (ii) constitute a material default of, give any third party the right to
terminate, modify or accelerate any obligation under, or require any
authorization, consent, approval, exemption or other action by, or notice to,
any Governmental Entity, except, with respect to the foregoing clause (ii) as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result
in a material adverse effect on Buyer's ability to perform its obligations
hereunder. 5E. Compliance with Laws. Except for such noncompliance that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
material adverse effect on Buyer's ability to perform its obligations
hereunder, Buyer is in compliance with all Laws applicable to it.  

   

 ![](exhibitpurchaseandsaleag021.jpg) 

\- 17 - 5F. Brokers. Neither Buyer nor any of its current Affiliates have any
liability or obligation to pay fees or commissions to any broker, finder or
agent with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for
which Seller or its Affiliates could become liable or obliged. 5G. Investment
Intent. Buyer is acquiring the Seller Interests for its own account for
investment and not with a view to any distribution or other disposition of all
or any part thereof in violation of federal or state securities Laws. Buyer
acknowledges that it is able to fend for itself, can bear the economic risk of
its investment in the Seller Interests and has such knowledge and experience
in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of an investment in the Seller Interests. Buyer is an "accredited
investor" as such term is defined in Regulation D under the U.S. Securities
Act. Buyer understands that the Seller Interests have not been registered
pursuant to the Securities Act or any applicable state securities Laws, that
the Seller Interests will be characterized as "restricted securities" under
federal securities Laws and that under such Laws and applicable regulations
the Seller Interests cannot be sold or otherwise disposed of without
registration under the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom. 5H. Available
Funds. Buyer has cash available to enable it to complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, pay all amounts payable by Buyer hereunder and
all fees and expenses required to be paid by Buyer in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. In no event shall the receipt by, or the
availability of any funds or financing to, Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
any other financing be a condition to Buyer's obligation to consummate the
Closing. 5I. Investigation. Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted its own
independent investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and is relying
on its own investigation and analysis in entering into and proceeding with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer is sophisticated and knowledgeable
about the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate and is
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the Purchase as contemplated by
this Agreement and is able to bear the substantial economic risk of such
investment for an indefinite period of time. Buyer has such knowledge and
experience as to be aware of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the
purchase of the Seller Interests. Buyer has been afforded access to the books
and records, facilities and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
purposes of conducting a due diligence investigation and has conducted a due
diligence investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries to its
satisfaction. 5J. Solvency; Fraudulent Conveyance. Immediately after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer and each of its
Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing)
(i) shall be able to pay their respective debts as they become due and (ii)
shall own assets which have a fair saleable value (if sold as an entirety with
reasonable promptness in an arm's length transaction under present conditions)
in excess of their liabilities (whether liquidated, unliquidated, fixed,
contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured, unsecured or
otherwise). Immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, Buyer and each of its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing) shall have adequate capital to carry on their
respective businesses. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation
is being incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors of Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing). 5K. Legal Impediments. There are no facts
relating to Buyer, any applicable Law or any Contract to which Buyer is a
party that would disqualify Buyer from obtaining control of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or that would prevent, delay or limit the ability of Buyer to
effect the Closing.  

   

 ![](exhibitpurchaseandsaleag022.jpg) 

\- 18 - 5L. No Conflicting Contracts. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
is a party to any Contract to build, develop, acquire or operate any electric
generation, or otherwise owns assets or is engaged in a business, that would
reasonably be expected to impair or cause a material delay in any Governmental
Entity's granting of a consent to the transactions contemplated hereby, and
neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates has any plans to enter into any such
Contract, acquire any such assets or engage in any such business prior to the
Closing Date. 5M. Regulatory Status. Buyer is not a "public utility" as
defined in the FPA. Schedule 5M identifies each of Buyer's "affiliates" (under
and as defined in the FPA and the rules and regulations of FERC promulgated
thereunder) that are "public utilities" as defined in the FPA and are subject
to regulation by FERC as public utilities. Each of Buyer's "affiliates" (under
and as defined in the FPA and the rules and regulations of FERC promulgated
thereunder) selling electric energy, capacity and certain ancillary services
at wholesale subject to the jurisdiction of FERC under the FPA has been
authorized by FERC to make wholesale sales of electric energy, capacity and/or
certain ancillary services at market- based rates pursuant to Section 205 of
the FPA, except for any such affiliate that owns one or more "qualifying
facilities" as defined in the FERC rules and regulations promulgated under the
Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended, that are entitled
to exemption from regulation under Section 205 of the FPA. Buyer is not
subject to regulation as a "public utility" or "public service company" (or
similar designation) with respect to its rates, securities issuances or
capital structure by any state Governmental Entity. 5N. Plant Closings and
Mass Lay-Offs. For a period of ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer
does not plan or contemplate any plant closings, reductions in force or
terminations of Transferred Employees that, in the aggregate, would trigger
the WARN Act. To facilitate the covenants set forth in this Section 5N, on or
before the Closing Date Seller shall provide Buyer with a list of employee
layoffs, by date and location, implemented by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the ninety (90)-day period preceding the Closing. 5O. No Other
Representations or Warranties. It is the explicit intent of each Party hereto
that Buyer is not making any representation or warranty whatsoever, express or
implied, except those representations and warranties expressly set forth in
this Article 5. ARTICLE 6 COVENANTS 6A. Access to Information. (i) During the
Interim Period, Seller shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to grant
to Buyer and its authorized Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to its senior officers,
properties, Books and Records that are in the possession or under the control
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent relating to the
transition of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' respective businesses and
the Seller Interests to Buyer; provided that (i) such access does not
unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) such access shall occur in such a manner as Seller
reasonably determines to be appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) all requests for such
access shall be directed to the Person(s) listed on Exhibit E hereto or such
other Person(s) as Seller may designate in writing from time to time
(collectively, the "Designated Contacts"), and (iv) nothing herein shall
require Seller to cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to provide
access, or to disclose any information, to Buyer or any of its Representatives
if such access or disclosure (w) would cause significant competitive harm to
Seller or any of its Affiliates, (x) would waive any legal privilege, (y)
would be in violation of applicable Laws or (z) would be in violation of the
provisions of  

   

 ![](exhibitpurchaseandsaleag023.jpg) 

\- 19 - any Contract to which Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company is a party; provided that Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to disclose information that would otherwise be limited by clause (x)
or clause (z) in a manner that does not result in the loss of such privilege
or does not result in the violation of such Contract (including to request,
but shall not be required to obtain, a waiver of any confidentiality
obligations upon Buyer's reasonable written request). Other than the
Designated Contacts or as expressly provided in the preceding sentence, Buyer
is not authorized to and shall not (and shall cause its Representatives and
Affiliates not to) contact (except in the ordinary course of Buyer's business
on matters unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) any
officer, director, employee, customer, supplier, regulator, distributor,
lessee, lessor, lender, noteholder, direct or indirect equityholder or other
material business relation or contact of Seller or any of its Affiliates, in
each case, prior to the Closing without the prior written consent of Seller.
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, abide by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement with respect to any access or information furnished
to it or its Representatives pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall the access provided for in this Section 6A or any
other obligation of any Person hereunder include any right of Buyer or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives to conduct any sampling or analysis of
environmental media, including sampling of the nature commonly referred to as
a "Phase II Environmental Investigation," such as air, any soil or groundwater
testing. (ii) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall preserve and retain, or cause the Company or its applicable Subsidiary
to preserve, retain and maintain in an accessible form, all corporate,
accounting, legal, auditing or other books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to the conduct of the businesses and operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date; provided,
however, that Buyer shall preserve, retain and maintain in an accessible form,
or cause the Company or its applicable Subsidiary to preserve and retain, all
Tax books and records until the later of (a) the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Closing Date and (b) six (6) months after the last date required for
retention of such books and records under applicable Law. (iii) After the
Closing Date, Buyer will, and will cause the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives to permit Seller (and its Representatives) to
have reasonable access to, and to inspect and copy (including in electronic
form), all materials referred to in Section 6A(ii) and to meet with officers
and employees of Buyer, the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives on a mutually convenient basis in
order to obtain explanations with respect to such materials, and to obtain
additional information; provided, however, that in the event that Buyer
transfers all or a portion of the business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any third party during the period referred to in Section
6A(ii), Buyer may transfer to such third party all or a portion of the books,
records, files and documents related thereto, provided such third party
transferee expressly assumes in writing the obligations of Buyer under this
Section 6A(iii) in an agreement in which Seller has third party beneficiary
right. In addition, on and after the Closing Date, at Seller's request and
cost, Buyer shall make available to Seller, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives, reasonable access, during normal business hours
and upon reasonable advance notice, to those officers and employees of the
Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company requested by Seller in connection
with any third party Claim against Seller or its Affiliates for which such
officers and employees have knowledge, including to provide testimony, to be
deposed, to act as witnesses and to assist counsel, in which case all of the
provisions set forth in Section 6A(i) shall apply mutatis mutandis for the
benefit of Buyer and its Affiliates in the place and stead of Seller. 6B.
Conduct of the Company Pending Closing. (i) During the Interim Period, except
as (w) set forth on Schedule 6B of the Company Disclosure Letter, (x)
consented to by Buyer in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), (y) contemplated by this Agreement or (z)
as otherwise

\- 20 - required by any applicable Law, Permit or Material Contract, Seller
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to (a) conduct their respective
businesses in the ordinary course of business, (b) use commercially reasonable
efforts to preserve their respective businesses as currently conducted,
including preserving relationships with Governmental Entities, customers and
suppliers and other Persons having business relationships with the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and (c) progress the activities related to ongoing steam
power augmentation and other capital improvement work, consistent with past
practice and in accordance with prudent electric industry practice as an owner
and operator of power generating facilities. Each of Buyer and Seller shall,

deliver, or cause their Affiliates to execute and deliver the Transition
Services Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, during the Interim Period,
except as (w) set forth on Schedule 6B of the Company Disclosure Letter, (x)
consented to by Buyer in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), (y) contemplated by this Agreement or (z)

with a promotion based on job performance or workplace requirements, (3) as
may be required under existing Contracts, including any Employee Benefit Plan
or applicable Law, (4) any increases for which Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall be solely obligated, or
(5) in the event of an adoption, amendment or grant that affects a broad
cross-section of employees of Seller or any of its Affiliates in addition to
affecting the Business Employees, (A) adopt or amend in any respect any
Employee Benefit Plan, if such adoption or amendment would result in new or
increased material costs to Buyer or its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing
Date or (B) grant to any Business Employee any increase in base salary, wages,
bonuses, incentive compensation, pension, severance or termination pay; (i)
create, incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable with respect to

its Subsidiaries) without Buyer's consent; (m) settle, commence or voluntarily

of or mitigate the existence of emergency situations or damage to the
environment or (II) protect material equipment or other material assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, so long as Seller shall, upon receipt of
notice of any such actions, promptly inform Buyer of any such actions taken
outside the ordinary course of business. For all purposes of this Agreement,
the "commercially reasonable efforts" of Seller shall not require Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Representatives to expend any money
other than de minimis amounts, commence any litigation or

\- 22 - arbitration proceeding, waive or surrender any material right, offer
or grant any accommodation or concession (financial or otherwise) or otherwise
suffer any detriment. 6C. Support Obligations. (i) Buyer recognizes that
certain of the Non-Company Affiliates have provided credit support to or on
behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries or other Non-Company Affiliates
that currently hold assets to be transferred prior to Closing pursuant to
Section 6O(iii) (the "Transferred Assets"), including guarantees, letters of
credit, escrows, sureties and performance bonds, security agreements and other
similar arrangements, which are outstanding as of the date hereof as set forth
on Exhibit F (such support obligations, to the extent related to the Company,
its Subsidiaries or the Transferred Assets as entered into, modified or
replaced from time to time in the ordinary course of business are hereinafter
referred to as the "Support Obligations"). (ii) Prior to the Closing, Seller
and Buyer shall cooperate to replace the Support Obligations and Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to replace the Support Obligations and, as
requested by Seller, effect the full and unconditional release of the Support
Obligations listed on Schedule 6C(ii) (provided that such release may not
require the termination in full of the underlying guarantees, letters of
credit, escrows, sureties and performance bonds, security agreements and other
similar arrangements to the extent such broader obligation relates to other
obligations of the Non- Company Affiliates), effective as of the Closing Date,
of the applicable Non-Company Affiliate from all Support Obligations and all
obligations and liabilities in respect thereof by: (a) furnishing a letter of
credit to replace each existing letter of credit that is a Support Obligation
containing terms and conditions equal to or more favorable to the beneficiary
thereof than the terms and conditions of such existing letter of credit; (b)
providing a Buyer guarantee to replace each existing guarantee that is a
Support Obligation containing terms equal to or more favorable to the
beneficiary thereof than the terms of such existing guarantee (other than with
respect to the credit rating of the guarantor); provided that if the
beneficiary of any existing guarantee does not accept such a replacement
guarantee, Buyer shall offer such beneficiary another form of acceptable
credit support and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the release
of each existing guarantee; or (c) instituting an escrow arrangement or
posting a surety or performance bond, or otherwise novating, assigning or
replacing any other Support Obligation on terms and conditions equal to or
more favorable to the beneficiary thereof than the terms and conditions of the
existing Support Obligations. In each case Buyer shall ensure any credit
support provided pursuant to this Section 6C(ii) satisfies all of the credit
support provisions of the applicable Contract, Law or Permit to which it
relates. For the avoidance of doubt, it is specifically acknowledged and
agreed by the Parties that Seller shall not be obligated to incur, pay,
reimburse or provide or cause any of its Affiliates to incur, pay, reimburse
or provide, any liability, compensation, consideration or charge in order to
replace the Support Obligations. (iii) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate, and
each shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, to cause the beneficiary
or beneficiaries of such Support Obligations to (a) remit any cash and cash
equivalents (including any interest payable thereon) to Seller or the
applicable Non-Company Affiliate held under any escrow or cash collateral
arrangement that is a Support Obligation promptly following the replacement of
such escrow or cash collateral arrangement pursuant to Section 6C(ii) and  

   

 ![](exhibitpurchaseandsaleag027.jpg) 

\- 23 - (b) terminate, surrender and redeliver to Seller, the applicable Non-
Company Affiliate or Seller's other designee each original copy of each
Support Obligation. (iv) If Buyer is not successful, following the use of
commercially reasonable efforts, in obtaining the full and unconditional
release, effective as of the Closing Date, of each Non-Company Affiliate from
all Support Obligations (each such Support Obligation, which is not released,
until such time as such Support Obligation is released in accordance herewith,
a "Continuing Support Obligation"), then: (a) from and after the Closing,
Buyer shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain promptly
the full and unconditional release of the Non-Company Affiliates from each
Continuing Support Obligation and evidence reasonably satisfactory to Seller
of each such release; (b) Buyer shall indemnify Seller and any applicable Non-
Company Affiliates for any Losses incurred by such Person in connection with
each Continuing Support Obligation (including reimbursement immediately
following demand therefor with respect to any demand or draw upon, or
withdrawal from, any Continuing Support Obligation); (c) Buyer shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates, including the Company and its Subsidiaries, not
to, effect any amendments or modifications or any other changes to, assign,
authorize or transfer to a third party, any Contracts or obligations to which
any of the Continuing Support Obligations relate, or otherwise take any action
that could increase, extend or accelerate the liability of Seller or any Non-
Company Affiliate under any Continuing Support Obligation, without Seller's
prior written consent; (d) to the extent that any Non-Company Affiliate has
any performance obligations under any Continuing Support Obligations from and
after the Closing, Buyer shall (I) at any Non-Company Affiliate's request and
without creating any agency relationship or agency liability in respect
thereof, perform such obligations of such Non-Company Affiliate to the maximum
extent practicable, or (II) otherwise take such actions as may be requested
from time to time by the applicable Non-Company Affiliate so as to put such
Non-Company Affiliate in the same position as if Buyer had performed or was
performing such obligations; and (e) Buyer shall deliver to Seller, on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates at the Closing and maintain at all times until
the full and unconditional release of each Continuing Support Obligation in
accordance with this Section 6C, a letter of credit or guarantee or other
credit support in a form reasonably acceptable to Seller from a third party
reasonably acceptable to Seller in an amount equal to the maximum amount of
all Continuing Support Obligations, it being understood that Seller may reject
any such credit support from any Person that maintains, or has maintained in
the prior six (6) months, less than an Investment Grade credit rating. The
"commercially reasonable efforts" of Buyer shall not require Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Representatives to commence any litigation or
arbitration proceeding or waive or surrender any material right. 6D.
Confidentiality; Publicity. Prior to the Closing, except for a press release
the form of which is to be agreed by Buyer and Seller and to be issued on
execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "Signing Press Release"), no
Party will make any public announcement or issue any public communication
regarding this Agreement or the proposed transaction, or any matter related to
the foregoing, without the prior written consent of the other Party, except
that Seller may make announcements from time to time to its Affiliates'
employees, customers, suppliers and other business relations and otherwise as
Seller may reasonably determine is necessary to comply with applicable Law  

   

 ![](exhibitpurchaseandsaleag028.jpg) 

\- 24 - or the requirements of any Contract to which Seller, the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company is a party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer
and Seller shall cooperate to prepare the Signing Press Release and joint
press releases to be issued promptly following the Closing Date, respectively,
following which any Party may issue an additional press release that is
consistent in all respects with the initial joint press releases and does not
add material non-public information not included by the Parties in the initial
press releases. From and after the Closing, the Parties agree to keep the
terms of this Agreement confidential, except to the extent and to the Persons
to whom disclosure is required by applicable Law or for purposes of compliance
with financial reporting obligations; provided, that the Parties may disclose
such terms to the Parties' respective Representatives as necessary in
connection with the ordinary conduct of their respective businesses (so long
as such Persons agree to, or are bound by Contract to, the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement and this Section 6D as if original parties hereto
and thereto). Buyer acknowledges that all information provided to it and to
any of its Affiliates, and Representatives by Seller or its Affiliates or
Representatives (including pursuant to Section 6A) is subject to the terms of
a confidentiality agreement between Seller and TransCanada Corporation (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), dated as of May 26, 2015, the terms of which are
hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference; provided, that if there
is any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, then the terms of this Agreement shall control and
govern to the extent of such inconsistency. 6E. Expenses. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, each Party will pay its own costs and
expenses incurred in anticipation of, relating to and in connection with the

another date for making such filings is otherwise provided on Exhibit D (in
which case the Parties shall be obligated to make such filings no later than
such other specified date); (b) comply as soon as reasonably practicable and
after consultation with the other Party with any request for additional

connection with the Purchase; (c) take, or cause to be taken, all other

or submission and in connection with any investigation or inquiry, in each
case related to any Governmental Authorization, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party; and (f) furnish the other Party with such
necessary information and commercially reasonable assistance as such other
Party and its Affiliates may reasonably request in connection with their
preparation of necessary filings, registrations or submissions of information
to any Governmental Entities in connection with this Agreement and the
Purchase, including any filings necessary or appropriate under the provisions
of the HSR Act or required by the FERC. (iii) With respect to the Governmental
Authorizations, each of Buyer and Seller shall, subject to any restrictions
under applicable Law: (a) promptly notify the other Party of and, if in
writing, furnish such Party with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise of the contents of) any material communication to it
from a Governmental Entity and permit the other Party to review and discuss in
advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the other Party in
relation to) any proposed material written communication to a Governmental
Entity (including any filing therewith); (b) keep the other Party informed of
any material developments, meetings or discussions with any Governmental
Entity; and (c) not independently participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Entity without giving the other Party prior notice of such
meeting or discussion and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Entity, the
opportunity to attend or participate. (iv) Without limiting the foregoing or
the provisions of Section 6O(i), in connection with the Governmental
Authorizations, each of Buyer and Seller will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the Governmental Authorizations. (v) Buyer acknowledges that
certain consents pertaining to the Material Contracts as identified in
Schedule 4C may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and such consents have not been obtained as of the date of
this Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates, to reasonably cooperate to the extent reasonably necessary to
facilitate the obtaining of such consents as soon as practicable in advance of
Closing; provided that such cooperation shall not include any requirement of
Seller or any of its Affiliates to expend money other than de minimis amounts,
commence any litigation or arbitration proceeding, waive or surrender any
right, or offer or grant any other accommodation or concession (financial or
otherwise) to any third party. Seller shall continue to reasonably cooperate
with Buyer following the Closing Date to obtain any of the foregoing consents
which were not obtained prior to the Closing. (vi) The "commercially
reasonable efforts" of Buyer shall not require Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Representatives to commence any litigation or
arbitration proceeding or waive or surrender any material right. 6G. Seller
Marks. (i) Buyer shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to (a)
as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event more than sixty (60) days
after the Closing Date, cease using any names, marks, trade names, trademarks,
corporate symbols or logos incorporating "Talen," "Talen Energy" or any name
or word confusingly similar thereto or constituting an abbreviation or
extension thereof (collectively and together with all other names, marks,
trade names, trademarks and corporate symbols and logos owned by Seller or any
of its Affiliates, the "Seller Marks"), and (b) with respect to any assets of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries bearing any Seller Mark, as soon as
reasonably practicable, but in no event more than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, relabel such assets or remove from such assets any and all
Seller Marks. Thereafter, Buyer shall not use any Seller Mark or any  

   

 ![](exhibitpurchaseandsaleag030.jpg) 

\- 26 - name or term confusingly similar to any Seller Mark in connection with
the sale of any products or services, in the corporate or doing business name
of any of its Affiliates or otherwise in the conduct of its or any of its
Affiliates' businesses or operations. (ii) In the event that Buyer breaches
this Section 6G, Seller shall be entitled to specific performance of this
Section 6G and to injunctive relief against further violations, as well as any
other remedies at law or in equity available to Seller. 6H. Intentionally
deleted. 6I. Insurance. Buyer shall be solely responsible for providing (i)
insurance to the Company and its Subsidiaries for any claims made after the
Closing, regardless of when the event or occurrence relating to any claim
arose and (ii) for any event or occurrence after the Closing. 6J. Termination
of Affiliate Arrangements. (i) Except as set forth on Schedule 6J of the
Company Disclosure Letter, prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause
the Non-Company Affiliates to, take such actions as may be necessary to
terminate, sever or assign to Seller or a Non-Company Affiliate (in each case
with appropriate mutual releases) (with all of the foregoing in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) effective upon or before the
Closing all Contracts between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and Seller or any Non-Company Affiliate, on the other hand (such
terminated, severed or assigned Contracts in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer, collectively, the "Terminated Affiliate Arrangements").
Prior to the Closing, (a) any amounts due and owing by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to any Affiliate of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries
shall be paid in full and (b) any amounts due and owing to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries by any Affiliate of the Company or of any of its
Subsidiaries shall be paid in full. (ii) Without limiting the generality of
Section 6J(i), as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ten (10)
days after the date of this Agreement, the Parties shall jointly make a filing
with FERC seeking to obtain an approval under, or waiver of, FERC's capacity
release requirements, as may be necessary to effectuate the permanent release
and assignment to Buyer, or its designee, of the Firm Capacity Agreement.
Seller shall cause its applicable Affiliate, as the holder of such Firm
Capacity Agreement, to join in such filing. 6K. Distributions. Notwithstanding
any other provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, prior to the
Adjustment Calculation Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
entitled to declare and pay dividends or other distributions, effect a return
of capital or otherwise cause the distribution of all Cash owned or held by or
for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to otherwise use
such Cash to pay or repay any liabilities of Seller, the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company (subject to any limitations or restrictions that may
be contained in the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' credit facilities or
any other instrument evidencing indebtedness of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries). Buyer acknowledges that all such Cash of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is the exclusive property of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
Seller. 6L. Employee, Labor and Benefits Matters. (i) Employee Benefit Plans.
From and after the Closing, no Transferred Employee shall have any right to
accrue any further benefits, nor any right to continue as an active
participant under the Benefit Plans, except for the employee designated in
Schedule 6L(i) who shall be deemed eligible for the Talen Energy Retiree
Health Plan (salaried) upon such employee's retirement as detailed in the
existing agreement with such employee referenced in Schedule 6L(i).  

   

 ![](exhibitpurchaseandsaleag031.jpg) 

\- 27 - (ii) WARN Act. On or before the Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer
with a true and complete list of employee layoffs, by date and location,
implemented in the ninety (90)-day period preceding the Closing. (iii) Any
Business Employee shall be referred to as a "Transferred Employee" for all
periods after the Closing Date. (iv) Buyer shall assume and be solely
responsible for all liabilities in respect of claims made by any Transferred
Employee for notice, retention, severance, retrenchment or other termination
pay or benefits relating to the termination of employment of any Transferred
Employee by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer only if such action occurs after
the Closing and at the direction of Buyer. (v) Buyer hereby agrees that
effective as of the Closing Date and continuing for at least one (1) year
following the Closing Date, or the date of termination of the relevant
Transferred Employee if earlier, Buyer will provide (or cause to be provided)
to each Transferred Employee (a) base salary or wages no less favorable than
the base salary or wages provided to such employee immediately prior to the
Closing and (b) other compensation (including bonus opportunity at "target")
and employee benefits that are, in the aggregate with respect to such
employee, substantially comparable in value to the compensation and employee
benefits provided to such employee immediately prior to the Closing. In
addition and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: for at least
one (1) year following the Closing Date Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to each Transferred Employee who is
terminated or receives notice of termination on or prior to the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, severance benefits equal to the
greater of (A) the severance benefits for which such Transferred Employee was
eligible as of immediately prior to the Closing, and (B) the severance
benefits provided for under the severance plans, policies or arrangements of
Buyer and its Affiliates. Buyer hereby agrees that, from and after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to,
grant all Transferred Employees credit for any service with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries earned prior to the Closing Date for
eligibility and vesting purposes under any benefit plan, program or
arrangement established, continued or maintained by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date (the "New
Plans") to the same extent such service was recognized under a similar
Employee Benefit Plan, except, in each case, to the extent such treatment
would result in duplicative benefits. For greater certainty, Transferred
Employees will have previous service recognized in the Buyer defined benefit
pension plan for eligibility and vesting but not for benefit accrual. In
addition, Buyer hereby agrees that Buyer shall, or shall use commercially
reasonable efforts and request from the Company and its Subsidiaries' medical,
dental and vision providers, if applicable, to, (x) waive all pre-existing
condition exclusion and actively-at-work requirements and similar limitations,
eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under
any New Plans to the same extent such conditions were not applicable under any
Employee Benefit Plan and (y) take into account any covered expenses incurred
on or before the Closing Date by any Transferred Employee (or covered
dependent thereof) for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Closing Date under
any applicable New Plan. Buyer and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
assume the obligation to provide health continuation coverage required by
Section 4980B of the Code under a New Plan with respect to any Transferred
Employee and his or her "qualified beneficiaries" (as defined in Section
4980B(g)(1) of the Code) who experience a "qualifying event" (as defined in
Section 4980B(f)(3) of the Code) on or after the Closing Date. Effective on
the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the
Transferred Employees the right to participate in a tax-qualified "401(k)"
plan sponsored, established or maintained by Buyer, the Company or their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (the "Buyer 401(k) Plan"). Each Transferred
Employee who, prior to the Closing, participated in a 401(k) plan sponsored or
maintained by Seller or its Affiliates (the "Seller 401(k) Plan") shall be
given the opportunity as soon as administratively practicable after the
Closing Date to receive a distribution of his or her account balance under the  

   

 ![](exhibitpurchaseandsaleag032.jpg) 

\- 28 - 401(k) Plan (in cash, but also including any promissory notes for
associated participant loans) and elect to roll over such account into the
Buyer 401(k) Plan. (vi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6L
with respect to any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately
following the Closing whose terms and conditions of employment are covered by
a collective bargaining agreement between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and a labor union, the terms and conditions of such employee's
employment shall be governed by the terms of the applicable collective
bargaining agreement, and Buyer shall cause the Company or such Subsidiary to
take or cause to be taken such actions as are required pursuant to the terms
of any applicable collective bargaining agreement covering employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately following the Closing in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. (vii) In the event that
this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing pursuant to Article 9, until
the date that is two (2) years from and after the date of such termination of
this Agreement, (a) Buyer shall not employ, and shall cause its Affiliates not
to employ, any Business Employee without Seller's prior written consent and
(b) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, solicit for hire or employment any
Business Employee or employee or officer of Seller or any of its Affiliates to
whom Buyer or its Representatives had been directly or indirectly introduced
or otherwise had first contact with as a result of its consideration of the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that this paragraph shall
not apply to any solicitation (or any hiring as a result of any solicitation)
(x) that consists of a general advertisement or solicitation by Buyer through
the use of media advertisements, the Internet, or professional search firms
that is not targeted at Business Employees or employees of Seller or its
Affiliates or (y) of any person who is no longer a Business Employee or
employed by Seller or its Affiliates. (viii) Seller agrees that for a period
of two (2) years from and after Closing, neither Seller nor Seller's
Affiliates nor Subsidiaries will solicit for hire or make an offer of
employment or hire any Transferred Employee or Business Employee; provided,
however, that this section shall not prohibit (i) any such offer pursuant to
any general advertisement or other general solicitation which is not
specifically directed at such persons or (ii) the offer or hiring of any such
person whose employment has been terminated by the Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries. (ix) Seller or one of its Affiliates will fully vest all
Transferred Employees in any Employee Benefit Plan or Seller 401(k) Plan at
time of Close, regardless of actual service with Seller. (x) Following the
Closing, Seller will pay to all Transferred Employees all incentive
compensation or bonuses (at the applicable target rate established by Seller,
or at an assessed rate higher than such target rate) for the year in which the
Closing occurs, prorated to the date of the Closing, which payment will be
made to such Transferred Employees at the same time that similar incentive
compensation and bonuses are paid to active employees of Seller and its then
Affiliates in respect of such bonus year; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to union-represented Business
Employees, Seller will pay all quarterly bonuses (if any are owed) pro-rated
in such quarter to the Closing Date. For greater certainty, Transferred
Employees in the Long Term Incentive program will remain eligible for all
grants made and not yet awarded or paid out, prorated to the date of the
Closing. (xi) Except as restricted by applicable Law, within fourteen (14)
days after the Closing, Seller will provide to Buyer in both paper and
electronic format all employee personnel records in its possession which
solely relate to the Transferred Employees including, but not limited to, all
I-9 forms, drug and alcohol testing records, performance management agreements
and all employee testing and qualification records which solely relate to the
Transferred Employees.  

   

 ![](exhibitpurchaseandsaleag033.jpg) 

\- 29 - (xii) Business Employees on Seller's Long Term Disability Plan shall
remain the responsibility of Seller until such time as the Business Employee
is fully fit to resume full-time duties in the position last held prior to the
commencement of such Business Employee's Long Term Disability Plan
eligibility. If the Business Employee is fit to return within one (1) year of
the Closing Date, Buyer or Buyer's Affiliate shall provide such Business
Employee with a position generally equivalent to that held prior to such
Business Employee's disability, at a rate of pay at least equivalent to such
Business Employee's pay at the time of such Business Employee's disability,
and benefits as provided for in the New Plans. Should no position be available
in such a situation, Buyer or Buyer's Affiliate will provide severance to the
Business Employee as detailed in Section 6L(v). If the Business Employee
becomes fit for full-time employment later than one (1) year after the
Closing, the responsibility to employ or provide severance to such Business
Employee will remain the responsibility of Seller. 6M. Tax Matters. (i) Seller
Tax Returns. Seller shall prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, in a manner consistent with past practice, all Tax Returns that
are required to be filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
all taxable periods of the Company and its Subsidiaries ending on or prior to
the Closing Date. Seller shall deliver any such Tax Return to Buyer in the
form proposed for filing at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date
thereof and shall consider in good faith all reasonable comments provided by
Buyer with respect thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, any federal income Tax
Return for the consolidated group that includes Seller and the Company and its
Subsidiaries for any taxable period shall not be provided to Buyer. Seller
shall pay or cause to be paid, within the time and in the manner required by
applicable Law, all Seller Pre-Closing Taxes due with respect to the Tax
Returns required to be filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect
to all taxable periods of the Company and its Subsidiaries ending on or prior
to the Closing Date. (ii) Buyer's Tax Returns. Buyer shall prepare and timely
file or cause to be prepared and timely filed, in a manner consistent with
past practice, all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by the Company
and its Subsidiaries with respect to a Straddle Period of Company and its
Subsidiaries. Buyer shall deliver any such Tax Return to Seller in the form
proposed for filing at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date
thereof and shall consider in good faith all reasonable comments provided by
Seller with respect thereto. Buyer shall not and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries after Closing) to amend
any such Tax Return without Seller's prior written consent, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Subject to Section
6M(iii), Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid, within the time and in the
manner required by applicable Law, all Taxes due with respect to Tax Returns
required by applicable Law, all Taxes due with respect to Tax Returns required
to be filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to Straddle
Periods of the Company and its Subsidiaries. (iii) Straddle Period. Seller
shall, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the due date of any Tax Return
that relates to a Straddle Period of Company or its Subsidiaries, pay to Buyer
any Taxes due with respect to such Tax Return that are Seller Pre-Closing
Taxes. In the case of any Straddle Period of Company or its Subsidiaries, the
amount of any Taxes that are Seller Pre-Closing Taxes or otherwise
attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined as follows: (A)
Taxes other than Property Taxes shall be allocated based on an interim closing
of the books as of the end of the day on the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date, and (B) Property Taxes shall be allocated based on the ration
that the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date bears to the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period; provided that any Taxes arising
from or imposed with respect to any action taken or transaction effected, in
each case outside the ordinary course of business, by Seller or its Affiliates
or any of the

Subsidiaries with respect to (1) Pre-Closing Tax Periods of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or (2) the portion of any Straddle Period of the Company and
its Subsidiaries ending on or before the Closing Date, shall, in each case, be
for the account of Seller, and Buyer shall pay over to Seller the amount of
any such refund (including any interest received thereon), net of any
reasonable costs, within ten (10) day after such amount has been received;
provided, however, that Seller shall not be entitled to any such refund to the
extent such refund was taken into account as an asset in the determination of
the final Closing Date Net Working Capital. (v) Tax Cooperation. Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any Party, in
connection with the preparation or filing of Tax Returns with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries and any Tax Contest of other proceeding (each a
"Tax Proceeding") with respect to any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period of
the Company and its Subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon a Party's request) the provision of records and information which
are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The requesting Party shall
reimburse the cooperating Parties for all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by such cooperating Parties. (vi) Transfer Taxes. Seller shall be
responsible for any Transfer Taxes imposed with respect to the sale or
transfer of the Seller's Interests (and any indirect transfer of assets held

sale or transfer of the Seller Interests to Buyer shall be timely prepared and
filed by the Party responsible for such filing under applicable Law. The Party
preparing any such Tax Return shall provide such Tax Return to the other Party
in the form proposed for filing at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
due date thereof and shall incorporate all reasonable comments provided by
such other Party with respect thereto. (vii) Purchase Price Allocation. If
Seller objects to the Purchase Price Allocation, then Seller shall provide
Buyer written notice thereof within thirty (30) days after receiving the
Purchase Price Allocation. If the Parties are unable to agree on any matter
set forth in the Purchase Price Allocation, the Parties shall refer such
dispute to the Arbiter, which firm shall make a final and binding
determination as to the matters in dispute within thirty (30) days following
its appointment, and promptly shall notify the parties in writing of its
resolution. Any Purchase Price Allocation determined pursuant to the decision
of the Arbiter shall incorporate, reflect and be consistent with Section 1060
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Each party
shall be liable for and pay one-half of the fees and other costs charged by
the Arbiter. Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonably efforts to
update the Purchase Price Allocation in a manner consistent with Section 1060
of the Code following any adjustment to the allocable Purchase Price or any
other amounts constituting consideration for U.S. federal income Tax purposes
pursuant to this Agreement. Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonably

delayed. Each of Seller and Buyer agrees to promptly advise the other
regarding the existence of any Tax audit, controversy or litigation related to
the Purchase Price Allocation. (viii) Tax Proceedings. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller, at its expense, shall, at
its option, have the right to conduct and control the defense of any Tax
Proceeding of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any Pre-Closing
Period of Company or its Subsidiaries; provided, that Seller shall not take
any action in connection with such Tax Proceeding if such action could have an
adverse effect on Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and
its Subsidiaries after the Closing) that is material without the prior written
consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Buyer, at its expense, shall have the right to conduct and control
the defense of any Tax Proceeding of Company or its Subsidiaries relating to
any Straddle Period of such Company or its Subsidiaries, provided, that to the
extent any such Tax Proceeding would have an adverse effect on Seller that is

interim period, none of Seller, the Company nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall, and Seller shall instruct its Representatives not to,

Buyer and its agents and Representatives, in an effort to facilitate such
third party's evaluation of an acquisition of all or substantially all of the
Company's equity securities or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole or any other transaction that would expressly prevent

Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including the limitations set forth in
this Section 6O(i)), each of Buyer and Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied and for
the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not
be required to: (i) sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of or hold
separate any assets, categories of assets, rights, product lines, licenses,

results of operations, cash flows, condition (financial or otherwise) or
prospects of any of Buyer or its Affiliates or the Company. (ii) As used in
this Agreement, the "commercially reasonable efforts" of Seller or Buyer, as
applicable, shall not require Seller or Buyer or any of their Subsidiaries,
Affiliates or Representatives to expend any money to remedy any breach of any
representation or warranty hereunder or to commence any litigation or
arbitration proceeding (or solely in the case of Seller to offer or grant any
accommodation or concession (financial or otherwise) to any third party or to
otherwise suffer any detriment or to provide financing to Buyer for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby). (iii) Prior to the

employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (b)
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date (including this

extent permitted under applicable Law. In the event of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, (x) each Indemnified DandO Party will be

this Agreement, other than those set forth in Sections 4M or 6M or the
Fundamental Representations, shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of
this Article 8 and shall terminate on the close of business on the date that
is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (the "Standard Limitation Date").
The Fundamental Representations of Seller set forth in this Agreement or in
any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing
until twenty (20) years after the Closing Date. The representations and
warranties and pre- Closing covenants of Seller set forth in either Section 4M
or Section 6M of this Agreement or in any related certificate delivered
pursuant to such sections of this Agreement shall survive the Closing and

warranties and pre-Closing covenants of Buyer set forth in this Agreement or
in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the
Closing solely for purposes of Article 8 and shall terminate on the Standard
Limitation Date; provided that Buyer's obligations to pay the Closing Purchase
Price (in whole or in part) and the other amounts payable by Buyer as and when

Notice is duly given in good faith under this Article 8 with respect to any
Claim for indemnification for breach of any such representation, warranty or
covenant, prior to the expiration of the applicable Limitation Date, the Claim
with respect to such alleged breach of such representation, warranty or
covenant shall continue until such Claim is finally resolved pursuant to this

extent resulting from (a) any breach of any of the  

   

 ![](exhibitpurchaseandsaleag042.jpg) 

\- 38 - representations and warranties made by Seller to Buyer contained in
Article 3 or Article 4, (b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller
contained in this Agreement requiring performance by Seller, (c) the
litigation matter set forth on Schedule 8B(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter
(the "Litigation Matter"), (d) the amount, if any, by which the funds
available in the Escrow are insufficient to pay when due the principal and
premium, if any, and interest due and to become due on the Ironwood Senior
Secured Notes on and prior to the earlier of the stated maturity of principal
thereof or upon redemption or prepayment (the "Escrow Matter"), (e) the
failure to pay the amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 6O(vii) and
6O(viii) without duplication of clause (d), and together with the Litigation
Matter, the "Specified Matters"). For purposes of determining whether there
has been a breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement and the
amount of Losses associated therewith for purposes of this Article 8, all
limitations or qualifications based on materiality, Material Adverse Effect,
or other terms of similar import or effect shall be disregarded. (ii)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 8: (a) Except in respect
of a Tax Indemnity, the Specified Matters or an indemnity in respect of the
breach of a Fundamental Representation, no Buyer Indemnitee shall assert any
Claim, and no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification, in each
case pursuant to Section 8B(i) unless and until the Loss relating to such

clause (a) (any Claim involving Losses equal to or less than such amount being
referred to as "De Minimis Claims"); (b) Except in respect of a Tax Indemnity,
the Specified Matters or an indemnity in respect of the breach of a
Fundamental Representation, no Buyer Indemnitee shall assert any Claim, and no
Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification, in each case pursuant
to Section 8B(i) unless and until the aggregate Losses of all Buyer
Indemnitees indemnifiable pursuant to Section 8B(i) (other than De Minimis
Claims) exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to 0.6% of the Base
Purchase Price (the "Deductible"), and then, subject to the other provisions
of this Article 8, the Buyer Indemnitees shall only be entitled to
indemnification to the extent such aggregate Losses are in excess of the
Deductible and not from the first dollar; and (c) Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) in no event shall the aggregate
liability paid or payable to the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to this Article 8
exceed an amount equal to 10% of the Base Purchase Price (the "Cap") except
for any Losses arising out of a breach of any of the Fundamental
Representations, the Specified Matters or a Tax Indemnity and (ii) in no event
shall the aggregate liability paid or payable to the Buyer Indemnitees
pursuant to this Article 8 (inclusive of those (I) set forth in clause (i) of
this Section 8B(ii)(c) and (II) in respect of a breach of the Fundamental
Representations, a Tax Indemnity or Losses arising out of the Specified
Matters) exceed an amount equal to the Final Purchase Price. 8C.
Indemnification by Buyer. From and after the Closing (but subject to the
provisions of this Agreement), Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its officers,
directors, employees and Affiliates (collectively, "Seller Indemnitees")
against, and hold each of them harmless from, any Losses suffered or incurred

Seller contained in this Agreement, (ii) any breach of any covenant or
agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement requiring performance by Buyer,
(iii) the conduct of the respective businesses of the Company and its

premium, if any, and interest due and to become due on the Ironwood Senior
Secured Notes on and prior to the earlier of the stated maturity  

   

 ![](exhibitpurchaseandsaleag043.jpg) 

\- 39 - of principal thereof or upon redemption or prepayment. For purposes of
determining whether there has been a breach of any representation or warranty
in this Agreement and the amount of Losses associated therewith for purposes
of this Article 8, all limitations or qualifications based on materiality,
Material Adverse Effect, or other terms of similar import or effect shall be
disregarded. 8D. Indemnification Procedures. (i) If a Buyer Indemnitee or a
Seller Indemnitee (each, an "Indemnified Entity") believes that a Claim,
demand or other circumstance exists that has given or may reasonably be
expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under this Article 8
(whether or not the amount of Losses relating thereto is then quantifiable),
such Indemnified Entity shall assert its Claim for indemnification by giving
written notice thereof (a "Claim Notice") to the party from which
indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") as promptly as reasonably
possible but in any event, (a) if the event or occurrence giving rise to such
Claim for indemnification is, or relates to, a Claim, brought by a Person not
a party to this Agreement or affiliated with any such Indemnified Entity (a
"Third Party," and such Claim, a "Third Party Claim"), within ten (10)
Business Days following receipt of notice of such Claim by such Indemnified
Entity, or (b) if the event or occurrence giving rise to such Claim for
indemnification is not, or does not relate to, a Claim brought by a Third
Party, within thirty (30) days after the discovery by the Indemnified Entity
of the circumstances giving rise to such Claim for indemnity. Each Claim
Notice shall describe the Claim in reasonable detail, including the nature of,
and factual and legal basis for, any such Claim for indemnification, and the
provisions of this Agreement upon which such Claim for indemnification is
made. The failure by the Indemnified Entity to timely notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification
obligation hereunder except to the extent that the defense of such Claim is
materially prejudiced by the failure to give such timely notice. After
delivery of the Claim Notice, the Indemnified Entity shall deliver to the
Indemnifying Party, within ten (10) Business Days after the Indemnified
Entity's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Indemnified Entity relating to the Third Party Claim.
(ii) If any Claim by an Indemnified Entity under this Article 8 relates to a
Claim filed or made against an Indemnified Entity by a Third Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and
may elect at any time to negotiate a settlement or a compromise of such Claim
or to defend such Claim with its own counsel. Should an Indemnifying Party
elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable to the Indemnified Entity for legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Entity in connection with the defense thereof. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Entity shall have
the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its
own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it
being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall control such
defense; provided that, with respect to any matter which, in the written
opinion of the Indemnified Entity's counsel, there is a material conflict of
interest between the Indemnified Entity and the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Entity shall be entitled to control such defense, to the extent of
the matter giving rise to such conflict and subject to the Indemnifying
Party's right to participate in such defense. Except with the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Entity, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, no Indemnifying Party shall settle or
compromise any such Third Party Claim or permit a default judgment or consent
to an entry of judgment unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (a)
relates solely to money damages, (b) provides for a full, unconditional and
irrevocable release of the Indemnified Entity with respect to the Claim(s)
being settled and (c) does not contain any admission or finding of wrongdoing
on behalf of the Indemnified Entity. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party
shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, neither the Indemnified
Entity nor any of its Affiliates shall admit any liability with respect to,
consent to the entry of any judgment, or settle, compromise or discharge, any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.
If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim,  

   

 ![](exhibitpurchaseandsaleag044.jpg) 

\- 40 - the Parties shall, and shall cause their officers, directors,
employees and Affiliates to, cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such
Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
Indemnifying Party's request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of all
records and information reasonably available to such Indemnified Entity
relating to such Claim, and making such Persons available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The party in charge of the defense shall keep the
other Parties fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or
any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. In the event the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of (or otherwise elects to negotiate or
settle or compromise) a Third Party Claim as described above, the Indemnified
Entity shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for all costs and expenses
incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with such defense (or
negotiation, settlement or compromise) to the extent, if applicable, that such
costs and expenses either (i) do not exceed the amount of the remaining
Deductible or (ii) exceed the Cap. 8E. General. (i) The amount of any and all
Losses under this Article 8 shall be determined net of any amounts recovered
or for which there is a right of recovery by an Indemnified Entity or its
Affiliates under or pursuant to any insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement
arrangement or Contract. (ii) The Buyer Indemnitees shall, and shall cause
their Affiliates and respective Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with
Seller and to take all commercially reasonable actions to avoid, minimize and
mitigate Losses that would otherwise be subject to indemnification under
Section 8B, including with respect to claims for indemnity under Section
8B(i)(a) for breach of the representations and warranties included in Section
4K including not undertaking, nor soliciting nor importuning any Governmental
Entity or other Person to require or undertake, any environmental sampling,
correction, investigation, monitoring or remediation unless affirmatively
required to do so by applicable Environmental Laws in effect as of the Closing
Date. In addition to any other limitations on indemnification that may apply,
with respect to any Claim for indemnification that any of the Buyer
Indemnitees may assert regarding Environmental Laws, Seller shall not have any
obligation with respect to such Claim to the extent the Losses for which
indemnification are sought (a) relate to a breach of obligations under this
Section 8E(ii), (b) arise out of any action to meet a cleanup or remedial
standard under Environmental Law that is more stringent or costly than the
minimum standard applicable as of the Closing Date for the continued use of
the relevant property or facility as it was used as of the Closing Date or
which does not employ any available risk-based standards or institutional
controls or (c) are ordinary costs of any post-Closing decommissioning,
construction, demolition or renovation of any asset of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. (iii) Intentionally deleted. (iv) If on or before the
Closing Date a Party has actual knowledge of the existence of Claims or other
events or occurrences for which it or its officers, directors, employees or
Affiliates would be entitled to indemnification under this Article 8, such
Party shall notify the other Parties of such Claims or other events or
occurrences prior to the Closing. (v) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that,
from and after the Closing (except for disputes under Section 2C, which
disputes will be resolved in accordance with the dispute mechanism set forth
in Section 2C, indemnification under Section 6P, Buyer's responsibility
pursuant to Section 6L(iv), indemnification under Section 6C, indemnification
under Section 6M and the obtaining of injunctive or other equitable relief as
provided in Section 10P), its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
and all Claims, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws
or otherwise (including any Claims arising under any Environmental Laws),
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and the  

   

 ![](exhibitpurchaseandsaleag045.jpg) 

\- 41 - Company Disclosure Letter and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Article 8. (vi) If any fact, circumstance or condition forming a basis for a
Claim for indemnification under this Article 8 shall overlap with any fact,
circumstance, condition, agreement or event forming the basis of any other
Claim for indemnification under this Article 8 there shall be no duplication
in the calculation of the amount of Losses. (vii) An Indemnifying Party shall
not be required to indemnify an Indemnified Entity to the extent of any Losses
that a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator shall have determined by
final, non-appealable judgment to have resulted from the fraud, gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnified Entity seeking
indemnification or its officers, directors, employees or Affiliates. (viii) In
no event shall any Indemnified Entity be entitled to recover or make a Claim
for any amounts in respect of, and in no event shall "Losses" be deemed to
include, (a) consequential, incidental or indirect damages, lost profits or
punitive, special or exemplary damages and, in particular, no "diminution of
value", "multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or similar valuation
methodology shall be used in calculating the amount of any Losses, (b) in the
case of any Buyer Indemnitee, any Loss to the extent included as a liability,
expense, reserve or contra asset in, or to the extent the matter giving rise
thereto was set forth in, the Financial Statements, or to the extent included
in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, (c) any liabilities that
arise out of changes after the Closing Date in applicable Laws or (d) any Loss
to the extent relating to actions taken or omitted to be taken by the
Indemnified Entity or any of its officers, directors, employees or Affiliates
after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if
any Buyer Indemnitee is indemnified for Losses pursuant to any provision of
this Article 8 by Seller, such Buyer Indemnitee shall not be entitled to
double recovery of any amount related to the same Losses from any other
source. (ix) Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for Tax purposes. ARTICLE 9 TERMINATION
9A. Grounds for Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing: (i) by either Buyer or Seller if the Closing shall not
have occurred within six (6) months after the date of this Agreement (which
date may be extended by any Party, by notice to the other Parties, for one
additional three (3)-month period if (A) one or more applicable Governmental
Authorizations have not been obtained by the date that is six (6) months after
the date of this Agreement and (B) the lack of any such Governmental
Authorizations is the sole reason that the unwaived conditions set forth in
Article 7 to consummate the Closing are unfulfilled as of the date that is six
(6) months after the date of this Agreement) (the "Outside Date"); provided,
that (a) Buyer shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9A(i) if the failure of the Closing to occur is the result of a
material breach by Buyer of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements hereunder and (b) Seller shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9A(i) if the failure of the Closing to
occur is the result of a material breach by Seller of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder; (ii) by Buyer,
if there has been a violation or breach by Seller of any covenant,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which has prevented the
satisfaction of any

\- 42 - condition to the obligations of Buyer to consummate the Closing set
forth in Article 7 (and such violation or breach has not been waived by Buyer)
and such violation or breach is not capable of being cured or, if capable of
being cured, shall not have been cured prior to the earlier of (a) ten (10)
days after written notice thereof from Buyer and (b) the Outside Date;
provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section

Third-Party Beneficiaries and Obligations. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended

successors and permitted assigns, any rights, remedies or liabilities under or
by reason of this Agreement, other than sections which are specifically for
the benefit of the Seller Group, the Indemnified DandO Parties and the Released
Persons as applicable (including under Section 6D, Section 6E, Section 8A,
Section 8C, Section 6P, Section 6Q and this Section 10E, as applicable), each
of which is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby or
to be paid thereunder and may be enforced by such Persons. The Parties further
agree that the rights of third-party beneficiaries shall not arise unless and
until the Closing occurs. The representations and warranties in this Agreement
are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit
of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with this Agreement without
notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of
the knowledge of any of the Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the
Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date. 10F. Governing Law. This Agreement, and all
claims or causes of action (whether at law or in equity, in contract or in

MANNER PROVIDED FOR NOTICES IN SECTION 10A OF THIS AGREEMENT. NOTHING IN THIS

PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND,

assigns. Any attempted assignment in violation of the terms of this Section
10I shall be null and void, ab initio. 10J. Headings. The headings contained
in this Agreement and descriptions of the Company Disclosure Letter are for
reference purposes only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and

of this Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced and
construed as if no such caption or description of the Company Disclosure
Letter had been used in this Agreement.

Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of days, such number shall refer to

Parties hereby confirms that they and their respective counsel have reviewed,
negotiated and adopted this Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding
of the Parties and the language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule
of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. In the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises with respect to this
Agreement, the terms and provisions of the execution version of this Agreement
shall control and prior drafts of this Agreement shall not be considered or
analyzed for any purpose (including in support of parole evidence proffered by
any Person in connection with this Agreement). (v) In the event of any
conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any Exhibit or

such amendment or waiver is set forth in a writing executed by Seller and
Buyer and (ii) subject to the first sentence of Section 7C with respect to the
waiver of conditions to Closing as of the Closing, any waiver of any provision

in a writing executed by such Person. No course of dealing between or among
any Persons having any interest in this Agreement shall be deemed effective to
modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or any rights or
obligations of any person under or by reason of this Agreement. No waiver by
any Party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more
instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any
other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion. 10M. Company
Disclosure Letter. Disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect
to any other section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter if the
relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure
based on the information disclosed; provided, that no such disclosure shall be
deemed to qualify the last sentence of Section 4E unless expressly set forth
in Section 4E of the Company Disclosure Letter. The inclusion of information
in the Company Disclosure Letter shall not be construed as, and shall not
constitute, an admission or agreement that a violation, right of termination,
default, liability or other obligation of any kind exists with respect to any
item, nor shall it be  

   

 ![](exhibitpurchaseandsaleag051.jpg) 

\- 47 - construed as or constitute an admission or agreement that such
information is material to Seller or the Company and its Subsidiaries. Neither
the specifications of any dollar amount in any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
the Company Disclosure Letter is intended to imply that such amount, or higher
or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not
material, and no Person shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such
amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between
the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in the Company Disclosure Letter is or is not material for
purposes of this Agreement. Further, neither the specification of any item or
matter in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement
nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Letter is
intended to imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or
are not in the ordinary course of business, and no Person shall use the fact
of setting forth or the inclusion of any such items or matter in any dispute
or controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described herein or included in the Company Disclosure Letter is or
is not in the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. 10N.
No Additional Representations; Disclaimer. (i) Buyer, on behalf of itself and
all Buyer Parties, acknowledges and agrees that neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates or Representatives, nor any other Person acting on behalf of Seller
nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives, has made any representation or
warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding Seller or the Company or its Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses, operations or assets, except as expressly set forth in
Article 3 or Article 4 (as modified by the Company Disclosure Letter),
respectively. Buyer further agrees that except to the extent provided in this
Agreement, neither Seller nor any of its direct or indirect Affiliates or
Representatives (or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
members, managers, partners, agents or otherwise), will have or be subject to
any liability to Buyer or any other Person resulting from any information,
document or material made available to, or used by, Buyer or its Affiliates or
their respective Representatives, including information, documents or
materials, provided in certain "data rooms" and online "data sites,"
management presentations, management interviews, or any other form in
expectation or anticipation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. (ii) Buyer, on behalf of itself and all Buyer Parties, acknowledges
and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties of Seller and
the Company expressly set forth in Article 3 or Article 4 (as modified by the
Company Disclosure Letter), respectively, the Seller Interests are being
acquired, and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are being
consummated "AS IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL FAULTS" AND WITHOUT ANY IMPLIED
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR INTENDED USE OR ANY OTHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED WARRANTY. SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE CONDITION,
VALUE OR QUALITY OF THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, THE SELLER
INTERESTS OR THE ASSETS OR THE PROSPECTS (FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE), RISKS AND
OTHER INCIDENTS OF THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND ANY SUCH OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that it is consummating the Purchase without any
representation or warranty, express or implied, whatsoever by Seller or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives, except for the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in Article 3 or Article 4. THE PROVISIONS
CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THOSE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLES 3 AND 4) ARE THE RESULT OF EXTENSIVE
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN BUYER AND SELLER AND NO OTHER ASSURANCES, REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE QUALITY, CONDITION OR STATE OF THE COMPANY OR ANY OF
ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE  

   

 ![](exhibitpurchaseandsaleag052.jpg) 

\- 48 - ASSETS WERE MADE BY SELLER IN THE INDUCEMENT THEREOF, EXCEPT AS
PROVIDED HEREIN. (iii) In connection with Buyer's investigation of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, Buyer has received, directly or indirectly, through its
Affiliates or Representatives, from or on behalf of Seller or its Affiliates
or Representatives, certain projections, including projected statements of
operating revenues, income from operations and cash flows of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (and the business transactions and events underlying such
statements) and certain business plan information, projections, presentations,
predictions, calculations, estimates and forecasts of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and other similar data. Buyer, on behalf of itself and all Buyer
Parties, acknowledges and agrees that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans, statements,
predictions, presentations, calculations and other similar data, that Buyer is
well aware of such uncertainties, that Buyer is taking full responsibility for
making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts, plans, statements, calculations, presentations,
predictions and other similar data so furnished to it (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans, statements, calculations, predictions and other similar
data), and that neither Buyer, nor any Buyer Party, shall have any Claim under
any circumstances against Seller or any other Person with respect thereto or
arising therefrom. Accordingly, Seller makes no representations or warranties
whatsoever to Buyer or any other Person, and expressly disclaims all liability
and responsibility, in each case with respect to such estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans, statements, calculations, presentations, predictions and
other similar data (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such projections, forecasts, plans, statements, calculations, presentations,
predictions and other similar data) or with respect to (a) the performance or
success of the Company and its Subsidiaries at any time after the date hereof,
and no such Person shall be entitled to rely on such estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans, statements, calculations, presentations, predictions and
other similar data for any purpose, including in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) the possibility or
likelihood of the occurrence of any environmental condition, release or
hazard, or any mechanical or technical issue, problem, or failure, or of any
interruption in service, or of any increase, decrease or plateau in the volume
of product or service, or revenue derived therefrom, or of the possibility,
likelihood or potential outcome of any complaints, controversies or disputes
with respect to existing or future customers or suppliers, in each case,
related to the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective assets. 10O.
Payments under Agreement. Each Party agrees that all amounts required to be
paid hereunder shall be paid in United States currency and, except as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, without discount, rebate or
reduction and subject to no counterclaim or offset (other than withholding Tax
obligations required to be withheld by Law), on the dates specified herein
(with time being of the essence). 10P. Specific Performance. The Parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached or threatened to be breached and that an award of money
damages would be inadequate in such event. Accordingly, it is acknowledged
that the Parties and the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief, without proof of actual damages, including an injunction or
injunctions or orders for specific performance to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (including any order sought by Seller to cause Buyer to perform its
agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement). Each Party further
agrees (i) that no other Party or any other Person shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 10P and
each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument  

   

 ![](exhibitpurchaseandsaleag053.jpg) 

\- 49 - and (ii) the right of specific performance and other equitable relief
is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
without that right, none of the Parties would have entered into this
Agreement. Each Party further agrees that the only permitted objection that it
may raise in response to any action for equitable relief is that it contests
the existence of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. The Parties
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance or other equitable
relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy or that the Parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at Law.
If, on or prior to the Outside Date, any Party brings any action to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other
Party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended (x) for the period
during which such action is pending, plus ten (10) Business Days or (y) by
such other time period established by the court presiding over such action, as
the case may be. 10Q. No Partnership Created. Nothing in this Agreement
(including Section 6A or Section 6B) is intended to give Buyer, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
operations prior to the Closing and, without limiting its obligations under
this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall exercise complete
control over their respective operations. Furthermore, in no event shall this
Agreement be deemed to create a partnership between Seller or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates, on the other hand,
and in no event shall any fiduciary or similar duty be deemed owed by Seller
or any of its Affiliates to Buyer or any of its Affiliates. 10R. Non-Recourse.
All claims, obligations, liabilities or causes of action (whether in contract
or in tort, in law or in equity or granted by statute) that may be based upon,
in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate
in any manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance
of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in, in
connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement) and the transactions
contemplated hereby, may be made only against (and such representations and
warranties are those solely of) the Persons that are expressly identified as
parties in the preamble to this Agreement (the "Contracting Parties"). No
Person who is not a Contracting Party, including any past, present or future
incorporator, member, partner, equityholder, Affiliate, Representative or
assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any Contracting Party, or
any past, present or future incorporator, member, partner, equityholder,
Affiliate, Representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender
to, any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Nonparty Affiliates"), shall have
any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted
by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations or liabilities
arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or based on, in respect of,
or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or
breach of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and, to the
maximum extent permitted by Law, each Contracting Party hereby waives and
releases all such liabilities, claims, causes of action and obligations
against any such Nonparty Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, to the
maximum extent permitted by Law, except to the extent otherwise set forth in
the Confidentiality Agreement, each Contracting Party disclaims any reliance
upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the performance of this Agreement
or any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an
inducement to this Agreement. 10S. Remedies. Buyer hereby acknowledges and
agrees that, from and after the date hereof through the Closing, except as set
forth in Section 10P, it shall not bring any Claim for breach of contract or
otherwise in respect of a breach of any representation or warranty set forth
in Article 3 or Article 4 and its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any such breach shall be (i) the limitation on Buyer's obligation to
consummate the Closing set forth in Article 7, if applicable, (ii) Buyer's
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9A, if applicable, (iii)
following the Closing, the

(iv) following any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9A, the
remedies set forth in Section 9B, if applicable. * * * * *
