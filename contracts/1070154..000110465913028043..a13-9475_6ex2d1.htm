AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 



 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 3, 2013 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and between Sterling Bancorp, a New York corporation (" _Sterling_ "),
and Provident New York Bancorp, a Delaware corporation (" _Provident_ ").

 



 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 



 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Provident and Sterling have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
stockholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
provided for herein, pursuant to which Sterling will, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Provident (the " _Merger_ "),
so that Provident is the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred
to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") in the Merger; and

 



 

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this Agreement
is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

THE MERGER

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with
the New York Business Corporation Law (the " _NYBCL_ ") and the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Sterling
shall merge with and into Provident. Provident shall be the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under
the laws of the State of Delaware. Upon consummation of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Sterling shall terminate.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, Provident shall become a duly registered bank
holding company (" _BHC_ ") and financial holding company under the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the " _BHC Act_ ").

 



 

1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
certificate of merger to be filed with the Department of State of the State of
New York (the " _New York State Department_ ") and the certificate of merger
to be filed with the Secretary of State of

 



      
 

 



 

the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary_ "), respectively, on the
Closing Date (collectively, the " _Certificates of Merger_ "). The term "
_Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes
effective, as set forth in the Certificates of Merger.

 



 

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the NYBCL and the
DGCL.

 



 

1.4 _Conversion of Sterling Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Provident, Sterling or the
holder of any of the following securities:

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of the common stock, par value $1.00
per share, of Sterling issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Sterling Common Stock_ "), except for shares of
Sterling Common Stock owned by Sterling as treasury stock or owned by Sterling
or Provident (in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as
a result of debts previously contracted), shall be converted into the right to
receive 1.2625 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of the common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Provident (the " _Provident Common Stock_ "); it
being understood that upon the Effective Time, pursuant to Section 1.5, the
Provident Common Stock, including the shares issued to former holders of
Sterling Common Stock, shall be the common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) All of the shares of Sterling Common Stock converted into the right to
receive Provident Common Stock pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ ", it
being understood that any reference herein to " _Certificate_ " shall be
deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the
ownership of shares of Sterling Common Stock) previously representing any such
shares of Sterling Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive (i) a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Provident
Common Stock which such shares of Sterling Common Stock have been converted
into the right to receive, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the
shares of Sterling Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been
converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section
2.2(e), without any interest thereon and (iii) any dividends or distributions
which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2.
Certificates previously representing shares of Sterling Common Stock shall be
exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of Provident Common Stock
(together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in
lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor) upon the surrender
of such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without any interest
thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Provident
Common Stock or Sterling Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased,
changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend
or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to
the Exchange Ratio.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of Sterling Common Stock that are owned by Sterling
or Provident (in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as
a result of debts previously

 



       
 

 



 

contracted) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of
Provident or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

1.5 _Provident Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
Provident Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of

1.6 _Sterling Stock Options; Sterling Restricted Stock Awards_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by Sterling to purchase shares
of Sterling Common Stock under a Sterling Stock Plan (as defined below),
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time (a " _Sterling Stock Option_ ") shall cease to
represent a right to acquire shares of Sterling Common Stock and shall be
converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of Provident Common
Stock for a number of shares and at an exercise price determined as provided
below, with such converted option to continue to be subject to the same terms
and conditions as were applicable to the Sterling Stock Option under the
Sterling Stock Plan and the applicable award agreement thereunder (but taking
into account any acceleration or vesting thereof provided for in the Sterling
Stock Plan, or in the related award agreement, by reason of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby):

 



 

(i) The number of shares of Provident Common Stock to be subject to the new
option shall be equal to the product of the number of shares of Sterling
Common Stock subject to the Sterling Stock Option and the Exchange Ratio;
_provided_ , that any fractional shares of Provident Common Stock resulting
from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share; and

 



 

(ii) The exercise price per share of Provident Common Stock under the new
option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Sterling Common Stock
of the Sterling Stock Option divided by the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that
such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Sterling Stock Plan_ " means the Sterling
Stock Incentive Plan (Amended and Restated as of May 20, 2004), as amended
December 29, 2008.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of Sterling Common
Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under
a Sterling Stock Plan which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (a " _Sterling Restricted Stock Award_ ") shall be converted
automatically into a restricted stock award in respect of the number of shares
of Provident Common Stock, rounded to the nearest whole share, equal to the
product of the number of shares of Sterling Common Stock subject to the
Sterling Restricted Stock Award and the Exchange Ratio, with such converted
restricted stock award to continue to be subject to the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the Sterling Restricted Stock Award under the
Sterling Stock Plan and the applicable award agreement thereunder (but taking
into account any acceleration or vesting thereof provided for in the Sterling
Stock Plan, or in the

 



      
 

 



 

related award agreement, by reason of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby).

 



 

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, Sterling, the Board of Directors of
Sterling and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any

Provident shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form
S-8 (or other appropriate form) registering such shares of Provident Common

with applicable law.

 



 

1.9 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization"
for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

ARTICLE II

 



 

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

 



 

2.1 _Provident to Make Shares Available_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Provident shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust
company designated by Provident and reasonably acceptable to Sterling (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for
exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates or, at Providents
option, evidence of shares in book entry form (collectively, referred to
herein as " _certificates_ "), representing the shares of Provident Common
Stock, and cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and certificates
for shares of Provident Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "), to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and paid pursuant to
Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Sterling Common Stock.

 



 

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than 10 days thereafter, Provident shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of one or more Certificates representing shares of
Sterling Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive Provident Common
Stock pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for certificates representing the number of whole shares of
Provident Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the
shares of Sterling Common Stock represented by such Certificate or
Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to
this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant
to Section 2.2(b). Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for
exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly
completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as
applicable, (i) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of
Provident Common Stock to which such holder of Sterling Common Stock shall
have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a check
representing the amount of (A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which
such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or
Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and (B)
any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.2, and the Certificate or Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Certificates.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive, upon surrender, the number of whole shares of Provident Common Stock
which the shares of Sterling Common Stock represented by such Certificate have
been converted into the right to receive and

 



      
 

 



 

any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or
distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

 



 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Provident
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with
this Article II. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Provident
Common Stock which the shares of Sterling Common Stock represented by such
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive.

 



 

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Provident Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition
of the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing shares of Provident Common Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Sterling of the shares of Sterling Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
certificates representing shares of Provident Common Stock as provided in this
Article II.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Provident Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or
distribution with respect to Provident Common Stock shall be payable on or
with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
stockholder of Provident. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Provident shall pay to each former stockholder of Sterling who
otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash
(rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the
closing-sale prices of Provident Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (the " _NYSE_ ") as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ for the five
(5) full trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing Date by (ii) the
fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of Provident Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Sterling for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of Sterling who
have not theretofore complied

 



      
 

 



 

with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of the shares of Provident Common Stock, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Provident
Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of Sterling Common
Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each
case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Provident, Sterling, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any
other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Sterling Common
Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 



 

(g) Provident shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Provident Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
this Section 2.2 or any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Sterling Common Stock such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Provident or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Sterling Common Stock in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made by Provident or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be.

 



 

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Provident, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Provident may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Provident Common
Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF STERLING

 



 

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Sterling to
Provident concurrently herewith (the " _Sterling Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Sterling Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Sterling that
such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect and
(c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of Article III shall be
deemed to qualify (1) any other section of Article III specifically referenced
or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of Article III to the extent it is
reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific
cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies
to such other sections or (ii) as disclosed in any Sterling Reports filed by
Sterling since December 31, 2011, and prior to the date hereof (but
disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking
statements"

 



      
 

 



 

disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific or
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), Sterling hereby
represents and warrants to Provident as follows:

 



 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 



 

(a) Sterling is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of New York, is a bank holding company
duly registered under the BHC Act and has elected to be treated as a financial
holding company under the BHC Act. Sterling has the corporate power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Sterling is duly licensed or qualified
to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Sterling. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material
Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to Provident, Sterling or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the
business, properties, results of operations or financial condition of such
party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ , _however_ , that,
with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed
to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory
accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or
regulations of general applicability to companies in the industries in which
such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts
or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global,
national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or
acts of terrorism) or in economic or market (including equity, credit and debt
markets, as well as changes in interest rates) conditions affecting the
financial services industry generally and not specifically relating to such
party or its Subsidiaries, (D) public disclosure of the transactions
contemplated hereby or actions expressly required by this Agreement or that
are taken with the prior written consent of the other party in contemplation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (E) a decline in the trading price
of a partys common stock or the failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings
projections, but not, in either case, including the underlying causes thereof;
except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B), or (C), to the extent that the
effects of such change are materially disproportionately adverse to the
business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial
condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to
other companies in the industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries
operate) or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word "
_Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any party, means any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, bank or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, which is consolidated with such party for
financial reporting purposes. True and complete copies of the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of Sterling (the " _Sterling Certificate_ ") and
the Bylaws of Sterling, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have
previously been made available by Sterling to Provident.

 



 

(b) Each Subsidiary of Sterling (a " _Sterling Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property

 



      
 

 



 

or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in which the
failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Sterling and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any
Subsidiary of Sterling to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case
of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or
distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit
accounts of each Subsidiary of Sterling that is an insured depository
institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "
_FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted
by law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection
therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the termination of
such insurance are pending or threatened. Section 3.1(b) of the Sterling
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all Subsidiaries of
Sterling as of the date hereof.

 



 

3.2 _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Sterling consists of 50,000,000 shares of
Sterling Common Stock and 644,389 shares of preferred stock, par value $5.00
per share, of which no shares of preferred stock are issued or outstanding. As
of the date of this Agreement, there are (i) 35,263,768 shares of Sterling

have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable
and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the
ownership thereof. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have the right to vote on any
matters on which stockholders of Sterling may vote. Except as set forth in
Section 3.2(a) of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this
Agreement, no trust preferred or subordinated debt securities of Sterling are
issued or outstanding. Other than Sterling Stock Options issued prior to the
date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other
commitments or agreements obligating Sterling to issue, transfer, sell,
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, any such securities. There are no
voting trusts, shareholder agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect
with respect to the voting or transfer of the Sterling Common Stock or other
equity interests of Sterling. Section 3.2(a) of the Sterling Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true, correct and complete list of all Sterling Stock
Options and Sterling Restricted Stock Awards outstanding as of the date hereof
specifying, on a holder-by-holder basis, (i) the name of each holder, (ii) the
number of shares subject to each such Sterling Stock Option and Sterling
Restricted Stock Award, (iii) the grant date of each such Sterling Stock
Option and Sterling Restricted Stock Award and (iv) the exercise price for
each such Sterling Stock Option. Other than the Sterling Stock Options and the
Sterling Restricted Stock Awards, no equity-based awards (including any cash
awards where the amount of payment is determined in whole or in part based on
the price of any capital stock of Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries) are
outstanding. Sterling has not elected

 



      
 

 



 

to defer interest payments with respect to any trust preferred securities or
related debentures issued by it or any of its affiliates.

 



 

(b) Except for the Trust Preferred Securities and the real estate investment
trust (" _REIT_ ") preferred securities issued by Sterling Real Estate Holding
Company, Inc., Sterling owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of
each of the Sterling Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges,
charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all
of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid, nonassessable (except, with respect to bank
Subsidiaries, as provided under 12 U.S.C. §55 or any comparable provision of
applicable state law) and free of preemptive rights, with no personal
liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Sterling Subsidiary has or is
bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights,
commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary.

 



 

3.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 



 

(a) Sterling has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of Sterling. The
Board of Directors of Sterling has determined that the Merger, on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, is in the best interests of
Sterling and its stockholders and has directed that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby be submitted to Sterlings stockholders for
adoption at a meeting of such stockholders and has adopted a resolution to the
foregoing effect. Except for the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative
vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Sterling Common
Stock (the " _Requisite Sterling Vote_ "), and the adoption and approval of
the Bank Merger Agreement by Sterling National Bank and Sterling as its sole
shareholder, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Sterling are
necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Sterling and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
by Provident) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Sterling,
enforceable against Sterling in accordance with its terms (except in all cases
as such enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions).

 



 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Sterling nor the
consummation by Sterling of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by Sterling with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i)
violate any provision of the Sterling Certificate or Sterlings Bylaws or (ii)
assuming that the consents and approvals referred to in Section 3.4 are duly
obtained, (x) violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation,

performance required by, or result in the

 



      
 

 



 

creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of
Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Sterling or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of clause (y) above)
for such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults which, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Sterling.

 



 

(c) Sterling National Bank has adopted the Bank Merger Agreement, Sterling, as
the sole shareholder of Sterling National Bank, shall, promptly hereafter,
approve the Bank Merger Agreement, and the Bank Merger Agreement has been duly
executed by Sterling National Bank.

 



 

3.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for (i) the filing of applications,
filings and notices, as applicable, with the NYSE, (ii) the filing of
applications, filings and notices, as applicable, with the Board of Governors

any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the failure
to file such report, registration or statement or to pay such fees and

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Sterling. Except for normal
examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of
business of Sterling and its Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency has initiated

Effect on Sterling.

(a) The financial statements of Sterling and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Sterling Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of Sterling and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash
flows, changes in shareholders equity and consolidated financial position of
Sterling and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the
respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited
statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii)
complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved,
except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto.
The books and records of Sterling and its Subsidiaries have been, and are
being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any
other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. Crowe Horwath LLP has not resigned (or informed Sterling that it
intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
Sterling as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Sterling
on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

 



 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Sterling, neither Sterling nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due),
except for those liabilities that are reflected or

 



       
 

 



 

reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Sterling included in its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012
(including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2012, or
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Sterling and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Sterling or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Sterling. Sterling (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) to ensure that
material information relating to Sterling, including its Subsidiaries, is made
known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
Sterling by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and (y) has disclosed, based on
its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Sterlings outside
auditors and the audit committee of Sterlings Board of Directors (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Sterlings
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Sterlings internal controls over
financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to
Sterlings auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made
available to Provident. There is no reason to believe that Sterlings outside
auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not
be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when next due.

 



 

(d) Since January 1, 2010, (i) neither Sterling nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Sterling, any director, officer, auditor, accountant
or representative of Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with
respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of
Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Sterling
or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Sterling or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Sterling or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Sterling
or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of Sterling, to any director or
officer of Sterling.

benefits, (iv) no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of

Plan or Multiple Employer Plan.

 



 

(h) Neither Sterling nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has sponsored or
has any obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that provides for
any post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life insurance
benefits for retired, former or current employees or beneficiaries or
dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid
on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and
records of Sterling.

 



 

(j) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have been asserted or
instituted, and, to Sterlings knowledge, no set of circumstances exists which
may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Sterling Benefit
Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Sterling
Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Sterling
Benefit Plans which could reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability of Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the IRS, the
Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple Employer Plan, any
participant in a Sterling Benefit Plan, or any other party.

any other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA),
which could subject any of the Sterling Benefit Plans or their related trusts,
Sterling, any of its Subsidiaries, any Sterling ERISA Affiliate or any person

any material tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section
502 of ERISA.

 



      
 

 



 

(l) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery
of, or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit
to any employee, officer, director or other service provider of Sterling or
any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the right of Sterling
or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion
of assets from any Sterling Benefit Plan or related trust. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash,
in property, or in the form of benefits) by Sterling or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either
solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction
with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code. Neither Sterling nor any of its Subsidiaries
maintains or contributes to a rabbi trust or similar funding vehicle, and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not cause or require Sterling
or any of its affiliates to establish or make any contribution to a rabbi

that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to
pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its
business (each, whether or not set forth in the Sterling Disclosure Schedule,
a " _Sterling Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has Sterling or any of its
Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2010, by any Regulatory Agency or
other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating,
ordering, or requesting any such Sterling Regulatory Agreement.

course of business and in accordance with applicable rules, regulations and
policies of any Regulatory Agency and with counterparties believed to be
financially responsible at the time and are legal, valid and binding

Environmental Law, pending or threatened against Sterling, which liability or
obligation would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the

ARTICLE IV

 



 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PROVIDENT

 



 

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Provident to
Sterling concurrently herewith (the " _Provident Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Provident Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Provident that
such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect,
and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of Article IV shall be
deemed to qualify (1) any other section of Article IV specifically referenced
or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of Article IV to the extent it is
reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific
cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies
to such other sections or (ii) as disclosed in any Provident Reports filed by
Provident since September 30, 2011, and prior to the date hereof (but
disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), Provident hereby
represents and warrants to Sterling as follows:

 



 

4.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 



 

(a) Provident is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is a savings and loan
holding company duly registered under the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act
( _provided_ , that at the Effective Time, Provident shall become a bank
holding company duly registered under the BHC Act that has elected to be
treated as financial holding company under the BHC Act). Provident has the
corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the

 



      
 

 



 

properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Provident. True and complete
copies of the Provident Certificate and Bylaws of Provident, as in effect as
of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available by
Provident to Sterling.

 



 

(b) Each Subsidiary of Provident (a " _Provident Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Provident, and (iii) has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any
Subsidiary of Provident to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case

distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit
accounts of each Subsidiary of Provident that is an insured depository
institution are insured by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the

paid in connection therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for
the termination of such insurance are pending or threatened. Section 4.1(b) of
the Provident Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all
Subsidiaries of Provident as of the date hereof.

Subsidiaries) are outstanding. Provident has not elected to defer interest
payments with respect to any trust preferred securities or related debentures
issued by it or any of its affiliates.

Subsidiaries, as provided under 12 U.S.C. § 55 or any comparable provision of
applicable state law) and free of preemptive rights, with no personal
liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Provident Subsidiary has or
is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights,

receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary.

Stock. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Provident and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Sterling)

Provident in accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such
enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions). The Provident

will have any preemptive right or similar rights in respect thereof.

Provident or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of
clause (y) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults which
either individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Provident.

approvals and consents will not be received in order to permit consummation of
the Merger and Bank Merger on a timely basis.

 



 

4.5 _Reports_. Provident and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all
reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments required
to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file since January
1, 2010 with any Regulatory Agencies, including, without limitation, any
report, registration or statement required to be filed pursuant to the laws,
rules or regulations of the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or
any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable
in connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report,
registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Provident. Except for normal examinations conducted
by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of business of Provident and its
Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding
or, to the knowledge of Provident, investigation into the business or
operations of Provident or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2010,
except where such proceedings or investigation would not reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Provident. There (i) is no unresolved violation, criticism, or
exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement
relating to any examinations or inspections of Provident or any of its
Subsidiaries, and (ii) has been no formal or informal inquiries by, or
disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory Agency with respect to the
business, operations, policies or procedures of Provident or any of its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2010, in each case, which would reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Provident.

 



 

4.6 _Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The financial statements of Provident and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Provident Reports (including the related
notes, where

 



      
 

 



 

applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books
and records of Provident and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes
in shareholders equity and consolidated financial position of Provident and
its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective
dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-
end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of
their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except,
in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The
books and records of Provident and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other
applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. Crowe Horwath LLP has not resigned (or informed Provident that
it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
Provident as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with
Provident on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

 



 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Provident, neither Provident
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to
become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of Provident included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2012
(including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2012, or
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Provident and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Provident or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Provident. Provident (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information relating to Provident, including its
Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of Provident by others within those entities as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the
certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
prior to the date hereof, to Providents outside auditors and the audit
committee of Providents Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect Providents ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Providents internal controls over financial reporting.
These disclosures were made in writing by management to Providents auditors
and audit committee and a copy has previously

 



      
 

 



 

been made available to Sterling. There is no reason to believe that
Providents outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

 



 

(d) Since January 1, 2010, (i) neither Provident nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Provident, any director, officer, auditor, accountant
or representative of Provident or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with
respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of
Provident or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that Provident or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Provident
or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Provident or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Provident or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of
Provident or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of Provident, to any
director or officer of Provident.

 



 

4.7 _Broker s Fees_. With the exception of the engagement of Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC,
neither Provident nor any Provident Subsidiary nor any of their respective
officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or financial advisor or
incurred any liability for any brokers fees, commissions or finders fees in
connection with the Merger or related transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Provident has disclosed to Sterling as of the date hereof the
aggregate fees provided for in connection with the engagements by Provident of
each of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated and Credit Suisse
Securities (USA) LLC, related to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereunder.

 



 

4.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 



 

(a) Since September 30, 2012, no event or events have occurred that have had
or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Provident.

 



 

(b) Since September 30, 2012, Provident and its Subsidiaries have carried on
their respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course.

 



 

4.9 _Legal Proceedings_.

 



 

(a) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on Provident, neither Provident nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to any, and there are no pending or, to Providents knowledge, threatened,
legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or
governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature against Provident or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their current or former directors or

 



       
 

 



 

executive officers or challenging the validity or propriety of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) There is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory
restriction imposed upon Provident, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of
Provident or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the
Merger, would apply to Provident or any of its affiliates).

 



 

4.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. Each of Provident and its Subsidiaries has duly
and timely filed (including all applicable extensions) all material Tax
Returns in all jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by
it, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material
respects. Neither Provident nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of
any extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return (other than
extensions to file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course). All material
Taxes of Provident and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax
Returns) that are due have been fully and timely paid. Each of Provident and
its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material taxes required to have
been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, creditor, shareholder, independent contractor or other third party.
Neither Provident nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any extension or
waiver of the limitation period applicable to any material Tax that remains in
effect. The federal income Tax Returns of Provident and its Subsidiaries for
all years to and including 2008 have been examined by the IRS or are Tax
Returns with respect to which the applicable period for assessment under
applicable law, after giving effect to extensions or waivers, has expired.
Neither Provident nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of
assessment or proposed assessment in connection with any material amount of
Taxes, and there are no threatened in writing or pending disputes, claims,
audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding any material Tax of
Provident and its Subsidiaries or the assets of Provident and its
Subsidiaries. Provident has made available to Sterling true and complete
copies of any private letter ruling requests, closing agreements or gain
recognition agreements with respect to Taxes requested or executed in the last
six years. Neither Provident nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is
bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or
arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between
or among Provident and its Subsidiaries). Neither Provident nor any of its
Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent
of which was Provident) or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any person
(other than Provident or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as
a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither Provident nor any
of its Subsidiaries has been, within the past two years or otherwise as part
of a "plan (or series of related transactions)" within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a part, a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section
355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock intending to qualify for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. Neither Provident nor any of
its Subsidiaries has participated in a "reportable transaction" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation section 1.6011-4(b)(1). At no time during the
past five years has Provident been a United States real property holding
corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code.

 



      
 

 



 

4.11 _Employees_.

 



 

(a) Section 4.11(a) of the Provident Disclosure Schedule lists all material
employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), whether or not
subject to ERISA, and all bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted
stock, incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance,
supplemental retirement, severance or other benefit plans, programs or
arrangements, and all retention, bonus, employment, termination, severance
plans, programs or arrangements or other contracts or agreements to or with
respect to which Provident or any Subsidiary or any trade or business of
Provident or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not incorporated, all of
which together with Provident would be deemed a "single employer" within the
meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA (a " _Provident ERISA Affiliate_ "), is a
party or has any current or future obligation or that are maintained,
contributed to or sponsored by Provident or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Provident ERISA Affiliate for the benefit of any current or former employee,
officer, director or independent contractor of Provident or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Provident ERISA Affiliate (all such plans, programs,
arrangements, contracts or agreements, collectively, the " _Provident Benefit
Plans_ ").

 



 

(b) Provident has heretofore made available to Sterling true and complete
copies of each of the Provident Benefit Plans and certain related documents,
including, but not limited to, (i) all summary plan descriptions, amendments,
modifications or material supplements to any Provident Benefit Plan, (ii) the
annual report (Form 5500), if any, filed with the IRS for the last two plan
years, (iii) the most recently received IRS determination letter, if any,
relating to a Provident Benefit Plan, and (iv) the most recently prepared
actuarial report for each Provident Benefit Plan (if applicable) for each of
the last two years.

 



 

(c) Each Provident Benefit Plan has been established, operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the
requirements of all applicable laws, including ERISA and the Code. Neither
Provident nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action to take corrective
action or make a filing under any voluntary correction program of the IRS,
Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any
Provident Benefit Plan, and neither Provident nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any knowledge of any plan defect that would qualify for correction under any
such program.

 



 

(d) Section 4.11(d) of the Provident Disclosure Schedule identifies each
Provident Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code (the " _Provident Qualified Plans_ "). The IRS has issued a
favorable determination letter with respect to each Provident Qualified Plan
and the related trust, which letter has not been revoked (nor has revocation
been threatened), and, to the knowledge of Provident, there are no existing
circumstances and no events have occurred that could adversely affect the
qualified status of any Provident Qualified Plan or the related trust or
increase the costs relating thereto. No trust funding any Provident Benefit
Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

 



 

(e) Each Provident Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) and any award thereunder,
in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, has (i) since
January 1, 2005, been maintained and operated, in all material respects, in
good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and

 



      
 

 



 

IRS Notice 2005-1 and (ii) since January 1, 2009, been, in all material
respects, in documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the
Code.

 



 

(f) With respect to each Provident Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code: (i) there does
not exist any accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412
of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived, (ii) no such plan
is in "at-risk" status for purposes of Section 430 of the Code, (iii) the
present value of accrued benefits under such Provident Benefit Plan, based
upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the most recent
actuarial report prepared by such Provident Benefit Plans actuary with
respect to such Provident Benefit Plan, did not, as of its latest valuation
date, exceed the then current fair market value of the assets of such
Provident Benefit Plan allocable to such accrued benefits, (iv) no reportable
event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day
notice requirement has not been waived has occurred, (v) all premiums to the
PBGC have been timely paid in full, (vi) no liability (other than for premiums
to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by
Provident or any of its Subsidiaries, and (vii) the PBGC has not instituted
proceedings to terminate any such Provident Benefit Plan.

 



 

(g) None of Provident and its Subsidiaries nor any Provident ERISA Affiliate
has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated
to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer Plan, and none
of Provident and its Subsidiaries nor any Provident ERISA Affiliate has
incurred any liability to a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan as a
result of a complete or partial withdrawal (as those terms are defined in Part
I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple
Employer Plan.

 



 

(h) Neither Provident nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has sponsored or
has any obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that provides for
any post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life insurance
benefits for retired, former or current employees or beneficiaries or
dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

 



 

(i) All contributions required to be made to any Provident Benefit Plan by
applicable law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and
all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any
Provident Benefit Plan, for any period through the date hereof, have been
timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid
on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and
records of Provident.

 



 

(j) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have been asserted or
instituted, and, to Providents knowledge, no set of circumstances exists
which may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Provident
Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the
Provident Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the
Provident Benefit Plans which could reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability of Provident or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the
IRS, the Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple Employer
Plan, any participant in a Provident Benefit Plan, or any other party.

 



      
 

 



 

(k) None of Provident and its Subsidiaries nor any Provident ERISA Affiliate
nor any other Person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA),
which could subject any of the Provident Benefit Plans or their related
trusts, Provident, any of its Subsidiaries, any Provident ERISA Affiliate or
any person that Provident or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to
indemnify, to any material tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

 



 

(l) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery
of, or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit
to any employee, officer, director or other service provider of Provident or
any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the right of Provident
or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion
of assets from any Provident Benefit Plan or related trust. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash,
in property, or in the form of benefits) by Provident or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either
solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction
with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code. Neither Provident nor any of its Subsidiaries
maintains or contributes to a rabbi trust or similar funding vehicle, and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not cause or require
Provident or any of its Affiliates to establish or make any contribution to a
rabbi trust or similar funding vehicle. No Provident Benefit Plan provides for
the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code,
or otherwise.

 



 

(m) There are no pending or, to Providents knowledge, threatened material
labor grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges against
Provident or any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other material labor
disputes against Provident or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Provident nor
any of its Subsidiaries are party to or bound by any collective bargaining or
similar agreement with any labor organization, or work rules or practices
agreed to with any labor organization or employee association applicable to
employees of Provident or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of
Provident, there are no organizing efforts by any union or other group seeking
to represent any employees of Provident or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

4.12 _SEC Reports_. Provident has previously made available to Sterling an
accurate and complete copy of each (a) final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC since December 31, 2010 by Provident pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act (the " _Provident Reports_ ") and (b)
communication mailed by Provident to its stockholders since December 31, 2010
and prior to the date hereof, and no such Provident Report, as of the date
thereof (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on
the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings,
respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading, except that information filed or furnished as of a later
date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date. Since December 31, 2010, as of their
respective dates, all

 



      
 

 



 

Provident Reports filed under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied
in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer
of Provident has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of
him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date

hold, and have at all times since December 31, 2010, held, all licenses,
franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses and ownership of their respective properties,
rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where neither the
cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such license,
franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees or
assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Provident, and to the knowledge
of Provident no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license,
franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. Provident and each of its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with and are not in
material default or violation under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule,

relating to political activity, (ii) made any unlawful payment to foreign
domestic governmental officials or employees or to foreign or domestic

(iv) established or maintained any unlawful fund of monies or other assets of
Provident or any of its Subsidiaries, (v) made any fraudulent entry on the
books or records of Provident or any of its Subsidiaries, or (vi) made any

Schedule, as of the date hereof, neither Provident nor any of its Subsidiaries

business consistent with past practice, (ii) which, upon the execution or
delivery of this Agreement, stockholder adoption of this Agreement or the

to any officer or employee thereof, (iii) which is a "material contract" (as
such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (iv)

occurrence of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, stockholder
adoption of this Agreement or the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or the value of any of the benefits of which
will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (vii) that relates to the incurrence of indebtedness by
Provident or any of its Subsidiaries (other than deposit liabilities, trade

$250,000 per annum (other than any such contracts which are terminable by

required payment or other conditions, other than the condition of notice).
Each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described
in this Section 4.14(a), whether or not set forth in the Provident Disclosure
Schedule, is referred to herein as a " _Provident Contract_ ," and neither
Provident nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice of, any
violation of the above by any of the other parties thereto which would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Provident.

 



 

(b) (i) Each Provident Contract is valid and binding on Provident or one of
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect, except as,
either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Provident, (ii) Provident and each of its
Subsidiaries has in all material respects performed all obligations

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Provident, (iii)
to Providents knowledge each third-party counterparty to each Provident
Contract has in all material respects performed all obligations required to be
performed by it to date under such Provident Contract, except where such
noncompliance, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Provident, and (iv) no event
or condition exists which constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or
both, will constitute, a material default on the part of Provident or any of
its Subsidiaries under any such Provident Contract, except where such default,
either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Provident.

 



 

4.15 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither Provident nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement
action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or
memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or
similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has
been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or has been since January 1,
2010, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since January 1, 2010,
has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or
suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that
currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or
that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to
pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its
business (each, whether or not set forth in the Provident Disclosure Schedule,
a " _Provident Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has Provident or any of its
Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2010, by any Regulatory Agency or
other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering
or requesting any such Provident Regulatory Agreement. There is no order,
circumstance or condition relevant or applicable to it that would prevent, or
is reasonably likely to prevent, Provident from satisfying the criteria for
"financial holding company" status under the BHC Act at the Effective Time and
all of the activities of Provident Bank and its Subsidiaries are permissible
for a national bank.

 



 

4.16 _Risk Management Instruments_. All interest rate swaps, caps, floors,

of Provident or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the ordinary
course of business and in accordance with applicable rules, regulations and
policies of any Regulatory Agency and with counterparties believed to be
financially responsible at the time and are legal, valid and binding
obligations of Provident or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable in accordance
with their terms (except as may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions),
and are in full force and effect. Provident and each of its Subsidiaries have
duly performed in all material respects all of their material obligations
thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued, and,
to Providents knowledge, there are no material breaches, violations or
defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.

 



 

4.17 _Environmental Matters_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Provident, Provident and its Subsidiaries are in compliance, and have
complied, with all Environmental Laws. There are no

 



      
 

 



 

legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims or actions or, to
the knowledge of Provident, any private environmental investigations or
remediation activities or governmental investigations of any nature seeking to
impose, or that could reasonably be expected to result in the imposition, on
Provident or any of its Subsidiaries of any liability or obligation arising
under any Environmental Law, pending or threatened against Provident, which
liability or obligation would reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Provident. To
the knowledge of Provident, there is no reasonable basis for any such
proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose any
liability or obligation that would reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Provident.
Provident is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter
agreement or memorandum of agreement by or with any court, governmental
authority, regulatory agency or third party imposing any liability or
obligation with respect to the foregoing that would reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Provident.

commodities are pledged in the ordinary course of business to secure
obligations of Provident or its Subsidiaries. Such securities and commodities
are valued on the books of Provident in accordance with GAAP in all material
respects.

 



 

(b) Provident and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses employ
investment, securities, commodities, risk management and other policies,

and procedures.

 



 

4.19 _Real Property_. Provident or a Provident Subsidiary (a) has good and
marketable title to all the real property reflected in the latest audited
balance sheet included in the Provident Reports as being owned by Provident or
a Provident Subsidiary or acquired after the date thereof (except properties
sold or otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the ordinary course of
business) (the " _Provident Owned Properties_ "), free and clear of all
material Liens, except for Permitted Encumbrances, and (b) is the lessee of
all leasehold estates reflected in the latest audited financial statements
included in such Provident Reports or acquired after the date thereof (except

Properties, the " _Provident Real Property_ "), free and clear of all Liens of
any nature whatsoever, except for Permitted Encumbrances, and is in possession
of the properties purported to be leased thereunder, and each such lease is
valid without default thereunder by the lessee or, to Providents knowledge,
the lessor. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Provident, threatened
condemnation proceedings against the Provident Real Property.

 



 

4.20 _Intellectual Property_. Provident and each of its Subsidiaries owns, or
is licensed to use (in each case, free and clear of any material Liens), all

be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Provident: (i) (A) to the
knowledge of Provident, the use of any Intellectual Property by Provident and
its Subsidiaries does not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the
rights of any person and is in accordance with any applicable license pursuant
to which Provident or any Provident Subsidiary acquired the right to use any
Intellectual Property, and (B) no person has asserted in writing to Provident
that Provident or any of its Subsidiaries has infringed, misappropriated or
otherwise violated the Intellectual Property rights of such person, (ii) to
the knowledge of Provident, no person is challenging, infringing on or
otherwise violating any right of Provident or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any Intellectual Property owned by and/or licensed to Provident or
its Subsidiaries, and (iii) neither Provident nor any Provident Subsidiary has
received any written notice of any pending claim with respect to any
Intellectual Property owned by Provident or any Provident Subsidiary, and
Provident and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable actions to
avoid the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of all Intellectual
Property owned or licensed, respectively, by Provident and its Subsidiaries.

any fact or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to prevent the
Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section

4.24 _Opinion_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Provident has
received an opinion from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated or

law), and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as such party may reasonably request. Neither Provident nor Sterling
nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access
to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of Providents or Sterlings, as the case may be,
customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in
possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to
the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties) or

 



      
 

 



 

contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 



 

(b) Each of Provident and Sterling shall hold all information furnished by or
on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated January 14, 2013, between Provident and Sterling (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



 

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 



 

6.3 _Stockholders  Approvals_. Each of Provident and Sterling shall call a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Provident Meeting_ " and the " _Sterling
Meeting_ ," respectively) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after
the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining (i) the Requisite
Sterling Vote and the Requisite Provident Vote required in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger and (ii) in the case of the Provident Meeting,
if so determined by Provident, the requisite approval of the stockholders of
Provident with respect to an amendment to the Provident 2012 Stock Incentive
Plan to increase the number of shares of Provident Common Stock authorized for
grant and the individual award limitations under such plan (the " _Provident
Stock Plan Amendment_ "), and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other
matters of the type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of
shareholders to adopt a merger agreement, and each shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such meetings to occur as soon as reasonably practicable
and on the same date. The Board of Directors of each of Provident and Sterling
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders of
Provident and Sterling, as the case may be, the Requisite Provident Vote, and,
if applicable, the requisite approval of the stockholders of Provident with
respect to the Provident Stock Plan Amendment, in the case of Provident, and
the Requisite Sterling Vote, in the case of Sterling, including by
communicating to its respective shareholders its recommendation (and including
such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that they adopt and approve
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. However, subject to
Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of Sterling or
Provident, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect
to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it
would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting
this Agreement to its shareholders, such Board of Directors may submit this
Agreement to its shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions
approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or
amended), in which event the Board of Directors may communicate the basis for
its lack of a recommendation to its shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement
or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by
law; _provided_ , that the Board of Directors may not take any actions under
this sentence unless (i) it gives the other party

 



      
 

 



 

at least three business days prior written notice of its intention to take
such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving
rise to its determination to take such action (including, in the event such
action is taken in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material
terms and conditions and the identity of the third party in any such
Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in
reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (ii) at the end of
such notice period, the Board of Directors takes into account any amendment or
modification to this Agreement proposed by the other party and after receiving
the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless more
likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable
law to continue to recommend this Agreement. Any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new notice period as referred
to in this Section 6.3. Provident or Sterling shall adjourn or postpone the
Provident Meeting or the Sterling Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the
time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient
shares of Provident Common Stock or Sterling Common Stock, as the case may be,
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting
Sterling or Provident, as applicable, has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Sterling Vote or
the Requisite Provident Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, each
of the Provident Meeting and Sterling Meeting shall be convened and this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of each of Provident and
Sterling at the Provident Meeting and the Sterling Meeting, respectively, for
the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the other matters
contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
either Provident or Sterling of such obligation.

 



 

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of
this Agreement, each of Provident and Sterling shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to
obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by Sterling or Provident or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Provident shall cause the shares of Provident
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, unless otherwise mutually determined,
the Sterling Benefit Plans and Provident Benefit Plans in effect as of the
date of this Agreement (other than such benefit plans as may be mutually
agreed) shall remain in effect with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

employees of Sterling and Provident (and their respective Subsidiaries),
respectively, covered by such plans at the Effective Time who continue to be
employed by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries after the Effective
Time until such time as the Surviving Corporation shall, subject to applicable
law and the terms of such plans, modify any existing plans or adopt new
benefit plans with respect to employees of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries (the " _New Benefit Plans_ "). Prior to the Closing Date,
Sterling and Provident shall cooperate in reviewing, evaluating and analyzing
the Provident Benefit Plans and Sterling Benefit Plans with a view towards
developing appropriate New Benefit Plans for the employees covered thereby. It
is the intention of Sterling and Provident, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, to develop New Benefit Plans (including amending existing
plans), as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, which,
among other things, (i) treat similarly situated employees on a substantially
equivalent basis, taking into account all relevant factors, including duties,
geographic location, tenure, qualifications and abilities, and (ii) do not
discriminate between employees who were covered by Provident Benefit Plans, on
the one hand, and those covered by Sterling Benefit Plans on the other, at the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Provident agrees that, during
the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, (A) each continuing employee of Provident, Sterling and
their respective Subsidiaries will continue to be provided with a base salary
that is no less favorable than the base salary provided by Provident, Sterling
or any such Subsidiary, as applicable, to such continuing employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (B) any continuing employee of Provident,
Sterling or any of their respective Subsidiaries who is terminated without
cause during such one-year period will be provided with severance benefits as
described in Section 6.6(a) of the Provident Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(b) With respect to any New Benefit Plans in which any employees of Provident
or Sterling (or their Subsidiaries) prior to the Effective Time first become
eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, and in which such
employees did not participate prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under any New
Benefit Plans in which such employees first become eligible to participate
after the Effective Time, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions,
exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Provident
Benefit Plan or Sterling Benefit Plan, as the case may be, (ii) provide each
such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments
and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a Provident Benefit
Plan or Sterling Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given
under the analogous Sterling or Provident Benefit Plan prior to the Effective
Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
under any New Benefit Plans in which such employees first become eligible to
participate after the Effective Time, and (iii) recognize all service of such
employees with Sterling and Provident, and their respective Subsidiaries, for
all purposes in any New Benefit Plan in which such employees first become
eligible to participate after the Effective Time to the same extent that such
service was taken into account under the analogous Sterling or Provident
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the foregoing
service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in
duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (B) for purposes of
any defined benefit pension plan or benefit plan that provides retiree welfare
benefits, or (C) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides
grandfathered benefits.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Surviving Corporation agrees to honor in accordance with their terms
all benefits vested as of the date hereof under the Provident Benefit Plans or
the Sterling Benefit Plans and each employment agreement and change in control
agreement listed on Section 3.11(a) of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule and
Section 4.11(a) of the Provident Disclosure Schedule. Each of Provident and
Sterling agrees that, for purposes of each Sterling Stock Plan and each
employment agreement and change in control agreement listed on Section 3.11(l)
of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement constitute a "change in control," "change of control" or term of
similar meaning.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Sterling shall, or shall cause its affiliates
to, adopt such resolutions, enact such amendments, provide such notices,
including to participants and governmental agencies, and take such other
actions as are required to provide that, effective as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, each Sterling Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit
pension plan (each, a " _Sterling Pension Plan_ ") shall be frozen to all
future benefit accruals effective as of no later than immediately prior to the
Effective Time. All resolutions, amendments, notices or other documents
issued, adopted or executed in connection with the implementation of this
Section 6.6(d) shall be subject to Providents prior review and approval.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of Provident or Sterling or any of their Subsidiaries
or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving
Corporation, Sterling, Provident or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or
shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving
Corporation, Sterling, Provident or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to
discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or
consultant of Provident or Sterling or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates
at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Sterling
Benefit Plan, Provident Benefit Plan, New Benefit Plan or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the
ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
to amend, modify or terminate any particular Sterling Benefit Plan, Provident
Benefit Plan, New Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting
the generality of the final sentence of Section 9.10, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person,
including without limitation any current or former employee, officer, director
or consultant of Provident or Sterling or any of their Subsidiaries or
affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

 



 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Provident and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director, officer or employee of Sterling and its Subsidiaries (in each case,
when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the " _Sterling Indemnified
Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection
with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising out of the fact
that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Sterling or any

 



       
 

 



 

of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to the same extent as such persons are indemnified as of the date of
this Agreement by Sterling pursuant to the Sterling Certificate, Sterlings
Bylaws, the governing or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of
Sterling and any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date
hereof; and Provident and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance
expenses as incurred by such Sterling Indemnified Party to the same extent as
such persons are entitled to advancement of expenses as of the date of this
Agreement by Sterling pursuant to the Sterling Certificate, Sterlings Bylaws,
the governing or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of Sterling and
any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date hereof; _provided_
, that the Sterling Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Sterling Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

 



 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Sterling (
_provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies
with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the
insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at
or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in
excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by
Sterling for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for
such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the
Surviving Corporations good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage
available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the
foregoing, Sterling, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of
Provident, may obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail"
policy under Sterlings existing directors and officers insurance policy
providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if
and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, on an
annual basis, does not exceed the Premium Cap.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Sterling Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns will consolidate
with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of
its assets or deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar
transaction, then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section
6.7.

 



 

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, any merger between a Subsidiary of
Provident, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Sterling, on the other) or to
vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets,
rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the
Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and
their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by Provident.

 



      
 

 



 

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Provident and Sterling shall each promptly advise the
other party of any change or event (i) that has had or is reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it believes would or would
be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained herein that reasonably
could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the
failure of a condition in Article VII; _provided_ , that any failure to give
notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not
be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.9 or the failure of any
condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise
constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such
notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result
in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be
satisfied.

 



 

6.10 _Dividends_.

 



 

(a) After the date of this Agreement, each of Provident and Sterling shall
coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect of
Provident Common Stock and Sterling Common Stock and the record dates and
payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties hereto
that holders of Sterling Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail
to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of
Sterling Common Stock and any shares of Provident Common Stock any such holder
receives in exchange therefor in the Merger. In furtherance of the foregoing,
(i) starting with the third quarter of 2013, the Board of Directors of
Sterling shall cause its regular quarterly dividend record dates and payments
dates for Sterling Common Stock to be similar to the regular quarterly
dividend record dates and payments dates for Provident Common Stock ( _i.e._ ,
Sterling shall move its dividend record and payment dates for the third
quarter of 2013 to approximately August 1 and August 15, respectively) and
(ii) the Board of Directors of Provident shall continue to pay dividends on
the Provident Common Stock on substantially the same record and payment date
schedules as have been utilized in the past.

 



 

(b) Subject to approval of the Board of Directors of the Surviving
Corporation, it is the intention of each of Provident and Sterling that,
beginning with the first dividend payment on Provident Common Stock after the
Effective Time, the dividend on the Provident Common Stock shall be increased
to $0.07 per share of Provident Common Stock.

 



 

6.11 _Corporate Governance_.

 



 

(a) Immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Board of Directors of Provident adopted a resolution, which may not be
withdrawn unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms,
providing for the Bylaw Amendment, effective as of the Effective Time. The
provisions of the Bylaw Amendment shall be considered an agreement of the
parties to this Agreement __ in all respects. In accordance with, and as
provided in, the Bylaw Amendment, effective as of the Effective Time, (i)
Louis J. Cappelli shall serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and (ii) Jack Kopnisky shall serve
as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Surviving Corporation.
Simultaneous with the execution of this Agreement, Provident shall enter into
the Service and Covenant Agreement with Louis J. Cappelli to be effective as
of and subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, which agreement shall
give effect to the provisions of this

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.11 and the Bylaw Amendment and supersede and replace the Amended and
Restated Employment Agreement, dated as of March 22, 2002, by and between Mr.
Cappelli and Sterling, as amended.

 



 

(b) Simultaneous with the execution of this Agreement, Provident shall enter
into an employment agreement or agreement for services with each of John
Millman, Howard Applebaum, Dale Fredston, John Tietjen and Michael Bizenov
(collectively, the " _Key Individuals_ ") to be effective as of and subject to
the occurrence of the Effective Time, which agreement shall set forth the
terms and conditions of such Key Individuals employment or other relationship
with the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time and shall
supersede and replace any prior employment, retention, change of control or
other similar agreement between such Key Individual and Sterling.

 



 

(c) Simultaneous with the execution of this Agreement, Provident shall amend
the Employment Agreement, dated as of June 20, 2011, by and among Provident,
Provident Bank, and Mr. Kopnisky, which amendment shall be effective as of and
subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time and which shall, among other
things, extend the term of such Employment Agreement until the third
anniversary of the Closing Date and give effect to the provisions of this
Section 6.11 and the Bylaw Amendment.

 



 

(d) On or prior to the Effective Time, in accordance with, and as provided in,
the Bylaw Amendment, Providents Board of Directors shall cause the number of
directors that will comprise the full Board of Directors of the Surviving
Corporation at the Effective Time to be 13. Of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time, seven shall be
current Provident directors designated by Provident including the current
Chief Executive Officer of Provident, and six shall be current Sterling
directors designated by Sterling including the current Chief Executive Officer
of Sterling and the current President of Sterling.

 



 

(e) On or prior to the Effective Time, Provident (as the sole shareholder of
Provident Bank) shall cause the number of directors that will comprise the
full Board of Directors of Provident Bank at the Effective Time to be 13,
constituted in the same manner and with the same individuals as the Board of
Directors of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

6.12 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or
proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with
any person concerning, or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic
information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any
person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that, in the event
either party receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal,
such party may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or
data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that
the Board of Directors of such party concludes in good faith (after receiving
the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters,

 



      
 

 



 

its financial advisors) that failure to take such actions would be more likely
than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable
law; _provided_ , _further_ , that, prior to providing any nonpublic
information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, such
party shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third
party on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement,
which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any
exclusive right to negotiate with such party. Each party will, and will cause
its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any person other than Sterling or Provident, as applicable,
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Each party will promptly (within
twenty-four (24) hours) advise the other party following receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms and
conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal), and will keep the other party apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any
amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition
Proposal. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any
existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof. As used in this
Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or
any third party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase,
direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of a party and
its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of
a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of the party, (ii) any
tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 25% or more
of any class of equity or voting securities of a party or its Subsidiaries
whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of
the consolidated assets of the party, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving a party or its Subsidiaries
whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of
the consolidated assets of the party.

 



 

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a party or its Board of
Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such Rules will in
no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules
would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 



 

6.13 _Public Announcements_. Sterling and Provident shall each use their
reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b) to
ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and (c) except in respect of any announcement required by
applicable law, or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing
any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

6.14 _Change of Method_. Sterling and Provident shall be empowered, upon their
mutual agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time, to change the
method or

 



      
 

 



 

structure of effecting the combination of Sterling and Provident (including
the provisions of Article I), if and to the extent they both deem such change
to be necessary, appropriate or desirable; _provided_ , however, that no such
change shall (i) alter or change the Exchange Ratio or the number of shares of
Provident Common Stock received by Sterling stockholders in exchange for each
share of Sterling Common Stock, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of
Sterlings stockholders or Providents stockholders pursuant to this
Agreement, (iii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of Sterling or Provident
pursuant to this Agreement or (iv) materially impede or delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner. The
Parties agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate amendment to this
Agreement executed by both parties in accordance with Section 8.3.

 



 

6.15 _Restructuring Efforts_. If either Sterling or Provident shall have
failed to obtain the Requisite Sterling Vote or the Requisite Provident Vote
at the duly convened Sterling Meeting or Provident Meeting, as applicable, or
any adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good
faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the
transaction provided for herein (it being understood that neither party shall
have any obligation to alter or change any material terms, including the
amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of the capital
stock of Sterling as provided for in this Agreement, in a manner adverse to
such party or its stockholders) and/or resubmit this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section
6.15) to its respective stockholders for adoption.

 



 

6.16 _Takeover Statutes_. None of Sterling, Provident or their respective
Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover
Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary
steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute
now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport
to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or
applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

 



 

6.17 _Trust Preferred Securities_. Upon the Effective Time, Provident shall
assume the due and punctual performance and observance of the covenants to be
performed by Sterling under the Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of
February 27, 2002, between Sterling and the Bank of New York, as Trustee
relating to 8.375% trust capital securities issued by Sterling Trust I (the "
_Trust Preferred Securities_ "), and the due and punctual payment of the
principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Trust Preferred
Securities. In connection therewith, Provident and Sterling shall execute and
deliver any supplemental indentures or other documents, and the parties hereto
shall provide any opinion of counsel to the trustee thereof, required to make
such assumptions effective.

 



 

6.18 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Sterling and Provident
agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain Sterling
Insiders (as defined

 



      
 

 



 

below), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that
Sterling Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of
the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in
connection with the conversion of shares of Sterling Common Stock into shares
of Provident Common Stock in the Merger and the conversion of Sterling Stock
Options and Sterling Restricted Stock Awards into Provident Stock Options or
Provident Restricted Stock Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and
retentive purposes agree to the provisions of this Section 6.18. Assuming
Sterling delivers to Provident in a reasonably timely fashion prior to the
Effective Time accurate information regarding those officers and directors of
Sterling subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act (the " _Sterling Insiders_ "), the Board of Directors of
Provident and of Sterling, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof
(as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange
Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter, and in any event prior to the
Effective Time, take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Sterling Common Stock, Sterling Restricted Stock Awards or
Sterling Stock Options by the Sterling Insiders, and any acquisitions of
Provident Common Stock, Provident Restricted Stock Awards or Provident Stock
Options by any Sterling Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will
be officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law.

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 



 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of Provident or Sterling:

 



 

(a) by mutual consent of Provident and Sterling in a written instrument, if
the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board;

 



 

(b) by either the Board of Directors of Provident or the Board of Directors of
Sterling if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory
Approval has denied approval of the Merger and such denial has become final
and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall
have issued a final nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite
Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of
such party set forth herein;

 



 

(c) by either the Board of Directors of Provident or the Board of Directors of
Sterling if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the first
anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless
the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure
of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the
covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

 



 

(d) by either the Board of Directors of Provident or the Board of Directors of
Sterling ( _provided_ , that the terminating party is not then in material

herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or
agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this
Agreement on the part of Sterling, in the case of a termination by Provident,
or Provident, in the case of a termination by Sterling, which breach or
failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other
breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to
be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date,
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a
termination by Provident, or 7.3, in the case of a termination by Sterling,
and which is not cured within 45 days following written notice to Sterling, in
the case of a termination by Provident, or Provident, in the case of a
termination by

 



      
 

 



 

Sterling, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or
such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination Date);

 



 

(e) by Sterling, if the Board of Directors of Provident shall have (i) failed
to recommend in the Joint Proxy Statement that the stockholders of Provident
adopt this Agreement, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation
in a manner adverse to Sterling, or resolved to do so, or failed to reaffirm
such recommendation within two (2) business days after Sterling requests in
writing that such action be taken, or failed to recommend against acceptance
of a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding Provident Common Stock

Sterling) within ten (10) business days after the commencement of such tender
or exchange offer, in any such case whether or not permitted by the terms
hereof, (ii) (A) recommended or endorsed an Acquisition Proposal, or (B)

such recommendation within two (2) business days after Provident requests in
writing that such action be taken, or failed to recommend against acceptance
of a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding Sterling Common Stock that
has been publicly disclosed (other than by Provident or an affiliate of
Provident) within ten (10) business days after the commencement of such tender
or exchange offer, in any such case whether or not permitted by the terms
hereof, (ii) (A) recommended or endorsed an Acquisition Proposal, or (B)
failed to issue a press release announcing its opposition to such Acquisition
Proposal within ten (10) business days after an Acquisition Proposal is
publicly announced or (iii) breached its obligations under Section 6.3 or 6.12
in any material respect.

 



 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Provident or
Sterling as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, and none of Provident, Sterling, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Sections 3.3(a),
3.7, 4.3(a), 4.7, 6.2(b) and this Section 8.2 and Article IX (other than
Section 9.1) shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither

thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Provident or Sterling
pursuant to Section 8.1(c) and Sterling shall have failed to obtain the
Requisite Sterling Vote at

 



       
 

 



 

the duly convened Sterling Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof

result of a willful breach of this Agreement), Section 8.1(f)(i), Section
8.1(f)(ii)(B), or Section 8.1(f)(iii), and (C) prior to the date that is
fifteen (15) months after the date of such termination, Sterling enters into a
definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that

into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such
transaction, pay Provident, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to
$13,250,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ , that for purposes of
this Section 8.2(b), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
to "25%" shall instead refer to "50%".

 



 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Provident pursuant to
Section 8.1(f)(ii)(A), then Sterling shall pay Provident, by wire transfer of
same day funds, a fee equal to 50% of the Termination Fee on the date of
termination, and an additional fee equal to 50% of the Termination Fee on the
earlier of the date Sterling enters into a definitive agreement or consummates
a transaction involving the Acquisition Proposal referenced in Section
8.1(f)(ii)(A) (or involving any other Acquisition Proposal with respect to
which Sterling enters into a definitive agreement or with respect to which
Sterling consummates a transaction, in either case prior to the date that is
fifteen (15) months after this Agreement is terminated).

 



 

(c) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a bona fide __ Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made known to senior management of Provident or has been made directly to
its stockholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced (and
not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Provident and (A)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Provident or Sterling
pursuant to Section 8.1(c) and Provident shall have failed to obtain the
Requisite Provident Vote at the duly convened Provident Meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof at which a vote on the adoption of this
Agreement was taken or (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Sterling
pursuant to Section 8.1(d) (as a result of a willful breach of this
Agreement), Section 8.1(e)(i), Section 8.1(e)(ii)(B), or Section 8.1(e)(iii),
and (C) prior to the date that is fifteen (15) months after the date of such
termination, Provident enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a
transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same
Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then Provident shall, on the
earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of
consummation of such transaction, pay Sterling the Termination Fee by wire
transfer of same day funds; _provided_ , that for purposes of this Section
8.2(c), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "25%"
shall instead refer to "50%".

 



 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Sterling pursuant to
Section 8.1(e)(ii)(A), then Provident shall pay Sterling, by wire transfer of
same day funds, a fee equal to 50% of the Termination Fee on the date of
termination, and an additional fee equal to 50% of the Termination Fee on the
earlier of the date Provident enters into a definitive agreement or
consummates a transaction involving the Acquisition Proposal referenced in
Section 8.1(e)(ii)(A) (or involving any other Acquisition Proposal with
respect to which Provident enters into a definitive agreement or with respect
to

 



      
 

 



 

which Provident consummates a transaction, in either case prior to the date
that is fifteen (15) months after this Agreement is terminated).

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages, the maximum aggregate
amount of fees payable by a single party under this Section 8.2 shall be equal
to the Termination Fee.

 



 

(e) Each of Provident and Sterling acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Provident or Sterling, as the case
may be, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2,
and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee or
any portion thereof, such non-paying party shall pay the costs and expenses of
the other party (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with
such suit. In addition, if Provident or Sterling, as the case may be, fails to
pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then such party shall
pay interest on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the "prime
rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto) in
effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made for the
period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid.

 



 

8.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with Merger by the stockholders of Provident
and Sterling; _provided_ , _however_ , that after adoption of this Agreement
by the respective stockholders of Provident or Sterling, there may not be,
without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement
that requires further approval under applicable law. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

 



 

8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or satisfaction of any conditions contained herein; _provided_
, _however_ , that after adoption of this Agreement by the respective
stockholders of Provident or Sterling, there may not be, without further
approval of such stockholders, any extension or waiver of this Agreement or
any portion thereof that requires further approval under applicable law. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance
with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

9.10 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other party. Any purported assignment in contravention
hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in Section 6.7, this Agreement (including the documents
and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may
not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 



 

9.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and, accordingly, that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
(including the parties obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement
under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

 



 

9.12 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

9.13 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or

 



      
 

 



 

communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a
".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a contract and each
party hereto forever waives any such defense.
