(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer agrees to
purchase from SM Energy, and SM Energy agrees to sell, assign and deliver to
Buyer the Assets for the consideration specified in this _Article II_.

(b) SM Energy shall reserve and retain all of the Excluded Assets.

_2.2 Purchase Price._

 

Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the purchase
price for the Assets shall be Seven Hundred Eighty-Five Million
Dollars ($785,000,000) (the " _Purchase Price_ "). The Purchase Price shall
be payable as follows:

(a) Upon the earlier of October 21, 2016, or one (1) Business Day following
the day when the Escrow Agent opens the escrow account, Buyer shall deposit by
wire transfer in immediately available funds with Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), the sum of $78,500,000 (such amount,
together with any interest earned thereon (the " _Deposit_ "), which Deposit
shall be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement, and disbursed in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement; and

(b) At Closing, Buyer shall pay SM Energy the Closing Amount by wire transfer
in immediately available funds.

_2.3 Deposit._

 

(a) If the transactions contemplated by _Section 2.1_ are not consummated on
or before the Closing Date because of: the failure of Buyer to materially
perform any of its obligations hereunder; provided, that SM Energy is not in
material breach of the terms of this Agreement and is ready, willing and able
to perform all of its obligations hereunder, or the failure of any of Buyers
representations or warranties hereunder to be true and correct in all material
respects (without regard to materiality qualifiers) as of the Execution Date
and as of the Closing, then, in such event, SM Energy shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement and receive the Deposit free of any claims by
Buyer thereto, as provided in _Section 12.2(b)_.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the mutual written agreement of the
Parties, or if the Closing does not occur on or before the Closing Date for
any reason other than as set forth in _Section 2.3(a)_, then Buyer shall be
entitled to the delivery of the Deposit, free of any claims by SM Energy with
respect thereto.

(c) In the event of any termination of this Agreement as contemplated by
_Section 2.3(a)_ or _Section 2.3(b)_ above, the Parties shall, in each case,
immediately have the rights and obligations set forth in _Section 12.2_ and
_Section 12.3_.

 



2 _2.4 Adjustments to Purchase Price._

 

(a) For purposes of determining the amounts of the adjustments to the Purchase
Price provided for in this _Section 2.4_, the principles set forth in this
_Section 2.4(a)_ shall apply. Buyer shall be entitled to all production of
Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the Units, Leases, and Wells at and after
the Effective Time (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto), and
to all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the
Assets at or after the Effective Time, and shall be responsible for (and
entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Operating Expenses incurred at
and after the Effective Time. SM Energy shall be entitled to all Hydrocarbon
production from or attributable to Units, Leases and Wells prior to the
Effective Time (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto), and to
all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the
Assets prior to the Effective Time, and shall be responsible for (and entitled
to any refunds with respect to) all Operating Expenses incurred prior to the
Effective Time. The Parties shall disclose to each other any revenues
received after the date of final settlement of the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.6 to which the other Party is entitled and account to such Party
within ten (10) days of receipt of such revenues. "Earned" and "incurred", as
used in the Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with GAAP and Council
of Petroleum Accountants Society standards, except as otherwise specified
herein. For purposes of allocating production (and proceeds and accounts
receivable with respect thereto), under this _Section 2.4_, (i) liquid
Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be " _from or attributable to_ " the Units,
Leases and Wells when they pass through the pipeline connecting into the
storage facilities into which they are run and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall
be deemed to be " _from or attributable to_ " the Units, Leases and Wells when
they pass through the royalty measurement meters, delivery point sales meters
or custody transfer meters on the gathering lines or pipelines through which
they are transported (whichever meter is closest to the well). SM Energy shall
utilize reasonable interpolative procedures, consistent with industry
practice, to arrive at an allocation of production when exact meter readings
or gauging and strapping data are not available. As part of the Preliminary
Settlement Statement, Buyer shall provide to SM Energy such data as is
reasonably necessary to support any estimated allocation, for purposes of
establishing the Closing Amount.

(b) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the following amounts
(without duplication):

(i) an amount equal to the value of all marketable Hydrocarbons produced from
or attributable to the Assets in storage or existing in stock tanks (excluding
tank bottoms), pipelines and/or plants (including inventory) as of the
Effective Time, the value to be based upon the contract price in effect as of
the Effective Time (or if there is no contract price, then the market price in
effect as of the Effective Time in the field in which such Hydrocarbons were
produced) or if actually sold prior to the date of determination,
the proceeds actually recovered by SM Energy attributable to such sale, net
of amounts payable as royalties, overriding royalties and other burdens upon,
measured by or payable out of such production and Asset Taxes;

 

(ii) an amount equal to all Operating Expenses for which Buyer is responsible
under _Section 2.4(a)_ paid by SM Energy that are attributable to the Assets
from and after the Effective Time, whether paid before or after the Effective
Time;

 



3 (iii) [ _reserved_ ];

 

(iv) Subject Transfer Taxes paid by SM Energy with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(v) all Asset Taxes allocated to Buyer that are paid or to be paid by SM
Energy; and

 

(vi) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed upon by the Parties.

 

(c) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the following amounts
(without duplication):

 

(i) an amount equal to all proceeds actually received by or credited to SM
Energy attributable to the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from or attributable
to the Assets from and after the Effective Time or contained in storage or
existing in stock tanks, pipelines and/or plants (including inventory) as of
the Effective Time for which an upward Purchase Price adjustment was made
pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_;

(ii) if SM Energy makes the election under _Section 6.2(c)(i)_ with respect
to a Title Defect, the Title Defect Amount with respect to such Title Defect
if the Title Defect Amount has been determined prior to Closing;

 

(iii) if SM Energy makes the election under _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ with respect
to an Environmental Defect, the Remediation Amount with respect to such
Environmental Defect if the Remediation Amount has been determined prior to
Closing;

 

(iv) an amount determined pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_, _Section
6.4(c)(ii)_ or  _Section 6.4(d)(i)_, as applicable, for any Asset excluded
from the transaction contemplated hereby pursuant to such Sections;

 

(v) the value of any Casualty Loss pursuant to _Section 6.3(b)(B)_;

 

(vi) all costs and expenses incurred by Buyer related to the Venting
Obligations (which in no event will exceed $600,000);

 

(vii) an amount equal to all Operating Expenses for which SM Energy is
responsible under _Section 2.4(a)_ paid or payable by Buyer that are
attributable to the Assets prior to the Effective Time;

(viii) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed upon by the Parties; and

(ix) all Asset Taxes allocated to Seller that are paid or to be paid by
Buyer.

 



4 (d) If, prior to Closing, Buyer or SM Energy discovers an error in the
Imbalances set forth in  _Schedule 3.10_, then the Purchase Price shall be
further adjusted at Closing (based on a value of (x) $1.00 per Mcf for gas
multiplied by the total volume of such imbalances and (y) NYMEX (as of the
Closing Date) less $6.00 per barrel multiplied by the total volume of oil
imbalances) pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)(iii)_ or _Section 2.4(c)(vi)_, as
applicable, and _Schedule 3.10_ will be deemed amended immediately prior to
the Closing to reflect the Imbalances for which the Purchase Price is so
adjusted.

_2.5 Allocated Value._

 

(a)

(a) SM Energy and Buyer have agreed upon an allocation of the unadjusted
Purchase Price among each of the Wells and Well Locations, and such
allocations are set forth on _Schedule 2.5(a)_ (the " _Allocated Values_ ").
SM Energy and Buyer agree that the Allocated Values shall be used in
calculating adjustments to the Purchase Price as provided herein. Any
adjustments to the Purchase Price, other than the adjustments provided for in
_Section 2.4_, shall be applied on a pro rata basis to the amounts set forth
in _Schedule 2.5(a)_ , as applicable, for all Assets. After all such
adjustments are made, any adjustments to the Purchase Price made pursuant to
_Section 2.4_ shall be applied to the amounts set forth on  _Schedule
2.5(a)_ , as applicable, for the particular affected Assets.

(b) On or before the Closing Date, Buyer and SM Energy will agree upon an
allocation of the unadjusted Purchase Price among each of the Assets, in
compliance with the principles of Section 1060 of the Code, and the United
States Treasury Regulations thereunder. Such allocation shall be in the format
of  _Schedule 2.5(b)_. SM Energy and Buyer agree (i) that the Allocated
Values, as adjusted pursuant to this paragraph, shall be used by SM Energy and
Buyer as the basis for reporting asset values and other items for purposes of
all federal, state, and local Tax Returns, including Internal Revenue Service
Form 8594 and (ii) that neither they nor their Affiliates will take positions
inconsistent with _Schedule 2.5(b)_ (as adjusted pursuant to this paragraph)
in notices to Governmental Bodies, in audit or other Proceedings with respect
to Taxes, in notices to preferential purchase right holders, or in other
documents or notices relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the consent of the other Party. Buyer and SM Energy further
agree that, on or immediately after the Closing Date, they will mutually agree
as to the further allocation of the values on _Schedule 2.5(a)_ as to the
relative portion of those values attributable to leasehold costs and
depreciable equipment.

_2.6 Settlement; Disputes._

 

(a) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, SM Energy shall
prepare and submit to Buyer for review a draft settlement statement using the
best information available to SM Energy (the " _Preliminary Settlement
Statement_ ") that shall set forth the adjusted Purchase Price reflecting each
adjustment made in good faith in accordance with this Agreement as of the
date of preparation of such Preliminary Settlement Statement. Within three (3)
Business Days of receipt of the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Buyer has
the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to SM Energy a written report
containing all changes with the explanation therefor that Buyer proposes to be
made to the Preliminary Settlement Statement.

 



5  The Preliminary Settlement Statement, as agreed upon by the Parties, will be
used to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing (such adjusted price, the "
_Preliminary Purchase Price_ "). If the Parties cannot agree on the
Preliminary Settlement Statement prior to the Closing, the Preliminary
Settlement Statement as presented by SM Energy and prepared in accordance with
this _Section 2.6(a)_ will be used to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing.

(b) On or before 120 days after the Closing, a final settlement statement
(the " _Final Settlement Statement_ ") will be prepared by SM Energy, based
on actual income and expenses attributable to the periods prior to and after
the Effective Time, including any amount set forth in the Preliminary
Settlement Statement as well as any settlement during the term of the
Transition Services Agreement, and which takes into account all final
adjustments made to the Purchase Price and shows the resulting final adjusted
Purchase Price (the " _Final Purchase Price_ "). SM Energy shall, at Buyers
request, supply reasonable documentation in its or its Affiliates possession
available to support the actual revenue, expenses and other items for which
adjustments are made. The Final Settlement Statement shall set forth the
actual proration of the amounts required by this Agreement. As soon as
practicable, and in any event within 45 days, after receipt of the Final
Settlement Statement, Buyer has the right, but not the obligation, to return
a written report containing any proposed changes to the Final Settlement
Statement and an explanation of any such changes and the reasons therefor (the
" _Dispute Notice_ "). If the Final Purchase Price set forth in the Final
Settlement Statement is mutually agreed upon by SM Energy and Buyer, the Final
Settlement Statement and the Final Purchase Price shall be final and binding
on the Parties. Once the Final Purchase Price has been agreed upon by
the Parties pursuant to this _Section 2.6(b)_ or determined by the
Accounting Arbitrator pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)_, as applicable, the
Parties shall execute a certificate setting forth such agreed or determined,
as applicable, Final Purchase Price, which shall be binding on the Parties

Intermediary (as that term is defined in Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(v) of the

rights in this Agreement, which assignment shall be in a form reasonably
acceptable to Buyer, and (b) pay the Purchase Price (or a designated portion

assignment shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to SM Energy, (ii) accept
the Purchase Price from the qualified escrow or qualified trust account at
Closing, and (iii) at Closing, convey and assign directly to Buyer the Assets

Qualified Intermediary shall not release any Party from any of its respective
liabilities and obligations hereunder, and that neither Party represents to
the other Party that any particular tax treatment will be given to any Party
as a result thereof. The Party electing to assign all or any of its rights
under this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 2.7_ shall defend, indemnify,
and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates from all claims, costs,
losses and expenses relating to such election.

nothing shall prohibit SM Energy or its Affiliates from using their knowledge
or mental impressions of such information or their general knowledge of the
industry or geographic area in the conduct of their respective businesses
following Closing.

ARTICLE VI

TITLE MATTERS; CASUALTIES

_6.1 SM Energy s Title. _

 

Without limiting Buyers remedies for Title Defects set forth in this _Article
VI_, except for the Subject Special Warranty, SM Energy makes no warranty or
representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise with respect to its
title to any of the Assets and Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that
Buyers sole remedy for any defect of title, including any Title Defect,
with respect to any of the Assets shall be as set forth in _Section 6.2_.

_6.2 Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments. _

(a) _Title Defect Notices_. On or before 4:00 p.m. (Mountain Time) on November
21, 2016 (the " _Defect Claim Date_ "), Buyer shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to deliver notices to SM Energy meeting the requirements of
this _Section 6.2(a)_ (each, a " _Title Defect Notice_ ") setting forth any
matters which, in Buyers reasonable opinion, constitute Title Defects and
which Buyer asserts as a Title Defect pursuant to this _Section 6.2_. For all
purposes of this Agreement and notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, except with respect to the Subject Special Warranty and/or claims
pursuant to _Section 8.1_ (solely as to matters occurring between the
Execution Date and the Closing Date), Buyer shall be deemed to have waived,
and SM Energy shall have no liability for, any Title Defect that Buyer fails
to assert as a Title Defect pursuant to a Title Defect Notice delivered in
material compliance with

 



19  this _Section 6.2(a)_ and received by SM Energy on or before the Defect
Claim Date. To be effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and
shall include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect and the Assets
affected by such Title Defect (each a " _Title Defect Property_ "), (ii) the
Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iii) supporting documents
reasonably necessary for SM Energy to verify the existence of the alleged
Title Defect(s), (iv) the amount by which Buyer reasonably believes the
Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title
Defect(s), and (v) the computations upon which Buyers belief is based. To
give SM Energy an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects,
Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give SM Energy, on or before the end
of each calendar week prior to the Defect Claim Date, written reports of
alleged Title Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding calendar week,
which reports may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the
expiration of the applicable Defect Claim Date, provided that the failure to
provide such reports shall not waive Buyers rights to provide a Title Defect
Notice prior to the Defect Claim Date for any Title Defect. Buyer shall also
promptly furnish SM Energy with written notice of any Title Benefit that is
discovered by Buyer or any Buyers Representative while conducting Buyers due
diligence with respect to the Assets prior to the Defect Claim Date.

 

(b) _Title Benefit Notices_. SM Energy shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to deliver to Buyer on or before the Defect Claim Date, a notice
setting forth any matters that, in SM Energys reasonable opinion, constitute
Title Benefits and that SM Energy asserts as a Title Benefit pursuant to this
_Section 6.2_ (each, a " _Title Benefit Notice_ ") including a description
of the Title Benefit and the Assets affected by the Title Benefit (the "
_Title Benefit Property_ "), the amount by which SM Energy reasonably believes
the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property is increased by the Title
Benefit, (iii) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Buyer to verify
the existence of the alleged Title Benefit and (iv) the computations upon
which SM Energys belief is based. SM Energy shall be deemed to have waived
all Title Benefits of which it, or Buyer pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_, has
not given notice on or before the Defect Claim Date.

 

(c) _Remedies for Title Defects_. Subject to SM Energys continuing right to
dispute the existence of a Title Defect or the Title Defect Amount asserted
with respect thereto and subject to the Individual Title Defect Threshold and
the Aggregate Deductible, in the event that any Title Defect properly asserted
by Buyer in accordance with _Section 6.2(a)_ is not waived in writing by
Buyer or cured on or before Closing, SM Energy shall, at its sole option,
elect to:

(i) transfer, convey and assign the entirety of the Title Defect Property
that is subject to such Title Defect, together with all associated Assets, to
Buyer at Closing, and reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Amount;

 

(ii) transfer, convey and assign the entirety of the Title Defect Property
that is subject to such Title Defect, together with all associated Assets, to
Buyer at Closing, in which event SM Energy shall have the right, for a period
of 110 days following the Closing Date (such period, the " _Cure Period_ "),
to cure any Title Defect relating to such retained Title Defect Property, and
should SM Energy cure such Title Defect during the Cure Period, then the
Purchase Price shall not be adjusted. If SM Energy is unable to cure any such
Title Defect during the Cure Period, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced
by an amount equal to the Title Defect Amount;

 



20 (iii) if agreed to by Buyer in writing, transfer, convey and assign the
entirety of the Title Defect Property that is subject to such Title Defect,
together with all associated Assets, to Buyer at Closing, and indemnify Buyer
against all Liability resulting from such Title Defect with respect to the
Assets pursuant to an indemnity agreement mutually agreeable to the Parties;
or

(iv) at Closing, retain the entirety of the Title Defect Property that is
subject to such Title Defect, together with all associated Assets and all
rights to operate such retained Assets, and reduce the Purchase Price by an
amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property and
associated Assets;

provided, however, if a Title Defect is a "most favored nations" clause in a
Lease, or related to an Unreviewed Material Contract, then Buyers sole and
exclusive remedy for such Title Defect shall be to exclude the affected Leases
or Assets, and all associated Assets, in which case the provisions of _Section
6.2(c)(iv)_ shall apply.

 

(d) _Remedies for Title Benefits_. With respect to each Well or Well Location
affected by Title Benefits reported under this  _Section 6.2_, the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts shall be decreased by an amount equal to the increase in
the Allocated Value for such Asset caused by such Title Benefits, as
determined pursuant to _Section 6.2(g) _(the " _Title Benefit Amount_ ").
The Title Benefit Amounts may only be used to offset Title Defect Amounts and
may not increase the Purchase Price.

 

(e) _Exclusive Remedy_. The provisions set forth in _Section 6.2(c)_ and
_Section 6.2(i)_, shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with
respect to SM Energys failure to have Defensible Title with respect to any
Asset, except for the Subject Special Warranty and/or claims pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ (solely as to matters occurring between the Execution Date and
the Closing Date).

(f) _Title Defect Amount_. The amount by which the Allocated Value of the
affected Title Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of
such Title Defect shall be the " _Title Defect Amount_ " and shall be
determined in accordance with the following terms and conditions:

 

(i) if Buyer and SM Energy agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 

(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated
in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be
paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest for such Title Defect Property stated in _Exhibit B_, and the
Working Interest attributable to such Title Defect Property has been reduced
proportionately, then the Title Defect Amount

 



21  shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the positive difference
between such Net Revenue Interest values, and the denominator of which is the
Net Revenue Interest for such Title Defect Property stated in _Exhibit B_,
provided that if the Net Revenue discrepancy does not affect the Title Defect
Property throughout its entire life, the Title Defect Amount determined under
this _Section 6.2(f)_ shall be reduced to take into account the applicable
time period only;

 

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Encumbrance upon or other
defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above,
including a Title Defect that represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest for such Title Defect Property stated in  _Exhibit B_, and the
Working Interest attributable to such Title Defect Property has not been
reduced proportionately, the applicable Title Defect Amount shall be
determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title Defect
Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the Title
Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of
the Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property, the values placed
upon the Title Defect by Buyer and SM Energy and such other reasonable
factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;

(v) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in any other
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

 

(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article VI_, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any single Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated
Value of such Title Defect Property, except (but subject to SM Energys rights
under _Sections 6.2(c)(ii)_ , _6.2(c)(iii)_ and  _6.2(c)(iv)_ ) if a Title
Defect is a lien, mortgage or deed of trust, the Title Defect Amount shall be
the amount necessary to remove such mortgage, deed of trust or lien (provided
that this exception shall not apply to mortgages, deeds of trust or liens
granted by the lessors under the Leases, unless there is a default thereunder
or foreclosure proceedings pursuant thereto).

 

(g) _Title Benefit Amount_. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title
Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions:

(i) if Buyer and SM Energy agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents an increase between (A) the Net Revenue
Interest for any Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest for
such Title Benefit Property stated in _Exhibit B_, and the Working Interest
has increased proportionately, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the
product of the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is

 



22  the positive difference between such Net Revenue Interest values, and the
denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest for such Title Benefit
Property stated in _Exhibit B_, provided that if the Net Revenue increase
does not affect the Title Benefit Property throughout its entire life, the
Title Benefit Amount determined under this _Section 6.2(g)_ shall be reduced
to take into account the applicable time period only;

(iii) if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the
applicable Title Benefit Amount shall be determined by taking into account
the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property, the portion of the Title
Benefit Property affected by such Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title
Benefit, the potential economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of
such Title Benefit Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer
and SM Energy and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a
proper evaluation; and

 

(iv) the Title Benefit Amount with respect to a Title Benefit Property shall
be determined without duplication of any items or amounts included in any
other Title Benefit Amount hereunder.

(h) _Title Threshold and Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase
Price or other remedies provided by SM Energy hereunder or under the
Assignment: (i) for any individual Title Defect for which the Title Defect
Amount does not exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold and (ii) for any
Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount exceeds the Individual Title
Defect Threshold unless the sum of the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all
such Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold
(excluding any Title Defect Amounts attributable to Title Defects cured by SM
Energy), exceeds the Aggregate Title Deductible, after which point Buyer shall
be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price only with respect to such
Title Defects in excess of the Aggregate Title Deductible. For the avoidance
of doubt, if SM Energy elects to transfer, convey and assign any Title Defect
Property pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)(ii)_, the Purchase Price shall not be
reduced by the Title Defect Amount of such Title Defect Property and the Title
Defect Amount relating to such Title Defect Property will not be counted
toward the Aggregate Title Deductible, unless SM Energy is unable to cure such
Title Defect during the Cure Period, in which case the Purchase Price shall
be adjusted as provided in _Section 6.2(c)(ii)._ If a single Title Defect or
series of related Title Defects affects several Well Locations in the same
drilling or spacing unit, then such Title Defect(s) shall be deemed to have
exceeded the Individual Title Defect Threshold if the total amount by which
such Title Defect(s) reduce(s) the Allocated Value(s) of all the affected Well
Locations exceed(s) the Individual Title Defect Threshold.

(i) _Title Dispute Resolution_. The Parties agree to resolve disputes
concerning the following matters pursuant to this _Section 6.2(i)_: (1) the
existence and scope of a Title Defect or Title Defect Amount, (2) the adequacy
of SM Energys Title Defect curative materials and Buyers reasonable
satisfaction thereof and (3) the existence and scope of a Title Benefit or
Title Benefit Amount (collectively, " _Title Disputed Matters_ "). The Parties
agree to attempt to initially resolve all disputes through good faith
negotiations. If the Parties cannot resolve disputes regarding Title Disputed
Matters, on or before Closing, the Closing shall be delayed as to only the
Assets subject to the Title Disputed Matters until the Parties finally resolve
the 

 



23  dispute pursuant to this _Section 6.2(i)_; provided, however, if either
Party asserts that the condition in _Section 9.1(d)_ or _Section 9.2(d)_ has
not been satisfied due, in whole or in part, to Title Defects, then the
Parties will resolve all Title Disputed Matters pursuant to this _Section
6.2(i)_ prior to Closing. In the event that neither Party asserts that the
condition in  _Section 9.1(d)_ or _Section 9.2(d)_ has not been satisfied,
it is understood and agreed that the Parties shall proceed to Closing as
contemplated herein as to all Assets not covered by a Title Disputed Matter.
The Title Disputed Matters will be finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 6.2(i)_. There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be an
attorney with at least 10 years experience in oil and gas title and
transactional matters, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and SM Energy
within 15 days after any Party invokes the provisions of this _Section
6.2(i)_ to resolve such Dispute, and absent such agreement, by the Houston
office of the AAA (the " _Title Arbitrator_ "). The arbitration proceeding
shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the
AAA Rules to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this
_Section 6.2(i)_. The Title Arbitrators determination shall be made within
20 days after submission by the Parties of the matters in Dispute and shall be
final and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his
determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in
_Section 6.2(f)_ and _Section 6.2(g)_ and, subject to the foregoing, may
consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are
necessary to make a proper determination. The Title Arbitrator, however, may
not award (a) Buyer a greater Title Defect Amount than the Title Defect Amount
claimed by Buyer in the applicable Title Defect Notice (which such Title
Defect Amount shall not exceed the Allocated Value of the applicable Title
Defect Property) or (b) SM Energy a greater Title Benefit Amount than the
Title Benefit Amount claimed by SM Energy in the applicable Title Benefit
Notice. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose
of determining the specific disputed Title Defect, Title Benefit, Title
Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount submitted by either Party and may not
award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any
Dispute. SM Energy and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other
costs of presenting its case to the Title Arbitrator. Each of SM Energy and
Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator.
To the extent that the award of the Title Arbitrator with respect to any
Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount was not taken into account as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price or the aggregate Title Defect Amounts, as
applicable at Closing pursuant to _Section 2.4_ and an adjustment would
otherwise be required under the provisions of _Section 6.2(c)_ or _Section
6.2(d)_, as applicable, then, within 10 days after the Title Arbitrator
delivers written notice to Buyer and SM Energy of its award with respect to
such Title Defect Amount or a Title Benefit Amount and subject to _Section
6.2(h)_, the Purchase Price will be adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.4_ by the
amount so awarded by the Title Arbitrator.

 

 _6.3 Casualty or Condemnation Loss._

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the
Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with
respect to (i) production of Hydrocarbons from the Assets through normal
depletion (including watering out of any well, collapsed casing or sand
infiltration of any well) and (ii) the depreciation of personal property due
to ordinary wear and tear and, in each case, Buyer shall not assert such
matters as Casualty Losses or Title Defects hereunder.

(b) If, from and after the Effective Time but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or is
taken in

 



24  condemnation or under right of eminent domain (a " _Casualty Loss_ "), and
the resulting loss from such Casualty Loss exceeds $100,000 based on the
Allocated Value of the affected Assets, then (i) Buyer shall nevertheless be
required to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) SM
Energy shall elect by written notice to Buyer prior to Closing to either (A)
cause, at SM Energys sole cost and as promptly as reasonably practicable
(which work may extend after the Closing Date), each Asset affected by such
Casualty Loss to be repaired or restored to at least its condition prior to
such casualty or taking, or (B) reduce the Purchase Price by the cost to
repair or restore each Asset affected by such Casualty Loss to at least its
condition prior to such casualty or taking. In each case, SM Energy shall
retain all rights to insurance, condemnation awards and other claims against
third parties with respect to the casualty or taking except to the extent the
Parties otherwise agree in writing.

 

 _6.4 Preferential Rights and Consents to Assign._

 

(a) All consents to assign relating to the Assets (" _Consents_ ") and
preferential rights to purchase (" _Preferential Rights_ ") are listed on
_Schedule 6.4_. The remedies set forth in this _Section 6.4_ are the
exclusive remedies under this Agreement related to the Consents and
Preferential Rights.

 

(b) From and after the Execution Date up to Closing, SM Energy shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts (with the cooperation of Buyer) to obtain all
Consents and waivers of all Preferential Rights (excluding any Customary Post-
Closing Consents); provided, however, that neither Party shall be required to
incur any Liability or pay any money in order to obtain such Consents
or waivers.

(c) _Preferential Rights_. SM Energy shall, within 10 days after the Execution
Date, send to each holder of a Preferential Right a notice requesting the
election or waiver by each such holder of its applicable Preferential Right,
in each case in material compliance with the contractual provisions applicable
to such Preferential Right, requesting a waiver of such right. Any
Preferential Right must be exercised subject to all terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, including the successful Closing of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article XI_. The consideration payable under this Agreement for
any particular Asset for purposes of Preferential Right notices shall be the
Allocated Value of such Asset.

(i) All Assets burdened by Preferential Rights for which (A) the applicable
Preferential Right has been waived, or (B) the period to exercise such
Preferential Right has expired prior to the Closing without the applicable
holder of such Preferential Right electing to enforce its Preferential Right,
shall, in each case, be assigned to Buyer at the Closing pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement.

 

(ii) If, prior to the Closing (A) any holder of a Preferential Right notifies
SM Energy that it intends to consummate the purchase of the portion of the
Assets to which its Preferential Right applies or (B) the time for exercising
a Preferential Right has not expired and the holder of such Preferential Right
has not waived such Preferential Right, then, in each case, such portion of
the Assets affected by such Preferential Right shall be excluded from the
Assets to be conveyed to Buyer at Closing and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of such excluded portion 

 



25  of the Assets. SM Energy shall be entitled to all proceeds paid by a Person
exercising a Preferential Right prior to the Closing. If, after the Closing
but prior to the date of final settlement of the Purchase Price under
_Section 2.6_, (1) such holder of such Preferential Right thereafter fails to
consummate the purchase of the portion of the Assets covered by such
Preferential Right or (2) the time for exercising such Preferential Right
expires without exercise by the holder thereof, then SM Energy shall (x) so
notify Buyer and (y) on or before 10 days following delivery of such notice,
assign such portion of the Assets to Buyer pursuant to an assignment in
substantially the form of the Assignment and the Purchase Price shall be
increased by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such portion of the
Assets.

 

(d) _Consents_. SM Energy, within 10 days after the Execution Date, shall send
to each holder of a Consent a notice seeking such holders consent to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(i) If (A) SM Energy fails to obtain a Consent prior to Closing and the
failure to obtain such Consent would cause (1) the assignment to Buyer of any
portion of the Assets to be void or expose Buyer to material damages or (2)
the termination of a Lease under the express terms thereof or (B) a Consent
requested by SM Energy is denied in writing, then, in each case, that portion
of the Assets affected by such Consent shall be excluded from the Assets to be
conveyed to Buyer at Closing and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of such portion of the Assets. In the event that a Consent
that was not obtained prior to Closing is obtained following Closing but prior
to the final settlement of the Purchase Price under _Section 2.6_ or
the requirement to obtain such Consent is waived by Buyer then, within 10
days after such Consent is obtained or the requirement to obtain such Consent
is waived by Buyer, (x) SM Energy shall assign such excluded portion of the
Assets to Buyer pursuant to an assignment in substantially the form of the
Assignment (and if the requirement to obtain a Consent is waived by Buyer,
Buyer shall have no claim against, and SM Energy shall have no Liability for,
the failure to obtain such Consent), and (y) Buyer shall pay to SM Energy by
wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the Allocated
Value of such portion of the Assets so assigned.

 

(ii) If (A) SM Energy fails to obtain a Consent prior to Closing and the
failure to obtain such Consent would not cause (1) the assignment to Buyer of
any portion of the Assets to be void or expose Buyer to material damages or
(2) the termination of a Lease under the express terms thereof and (B) such
Consent requested by SM Energy is not denied in writing, then that portion of
the Assets subject to such Consent shall be assigned by SM Energy to Buyer at
Closing pursuant to the Assignment and Buyer shall have no claim against, and
SM Energy shall have no Liability for, the failure to obtain such Consent.

 



26 ARTICLE VII

 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

 

 _7.1 Environmental Defects._

 

(a) _Environmental Defects Notice_. On or before the Defect Claim Date, Buyer
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver notices to SM Energy
materially meeting the requirements of this _Section 7.1(a)_ (each, an "
_Environmental Defect Notice_ ") setting forth any matters that, in Buyers
reasonable opinion, constitute Environmental Defects and that Buyer asserts
as Environmental Defects pursuant to this _Section 7.1_. For all purposes of
this Agreement, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any Environmental Defect
that Buyer fails to properly assert as an Environmental Defect pursuant to an
Environmental Defect Notice delivered in accordance with this _Section 7.1(a)
_and received by SM Energy on or before the Defect Claim Date, except for
claims relating to a breach of  _Section 3.12_, or claims pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ (solely as to matters occurring between the Execution Date and
the Closing Date), _Section 13.2(d), _and/or _Section 13.2(g)_. To be
effective, each Environmental Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall
include: (i) a description of the Environmental Condition constituting the
alleged Environmental Defect, including the Environmental Law(s) violated by
such Environmental Defect, (ii) each Asset (or portion thereof) affected by
the alleged Environmental Defect (the " _Environmental Defect Property_ "),
(iii) the Allocated Value of each Environmental Defect Property, (iv)
supporting documents in the possession of Buyer reasonably necessary for SM
Energy to verify the existence of the alleged Environmental Defect, and (v) a
calculation of the Remediation Amount (itemized in reasonable detail) that
Buyer asserts is attributable to such alleged Environmental Defect. Buyers
calculation of the Remediation Amount included in the Environmental Defect
Notice must describe in reasonable detail the Remediation proposed for the
Environmental Condition that gives rise to the asserted Environmental Defect
and identify all assumptions used by Buyer in calculating the Remediation
Amount, including the standards that Buyer asserts must be met to comply with
Environmental Laws. SM Energy shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to cure any claimed Environmental Defect on or before Closing. To give SM
Energy an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Environmental Defects,
Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give SM Energy, on or before
the end of each calendar week prior to the Defect Claim Date, written report
of all alleged Environmental Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding
calendar week, which reports may be preliminary in nature and supplemented
prior to the expiration of the applicable Defect Claim Date, provided,
however, that the failure to provide such reports shall not waive Buyers
rights to provide an Environmental Defect Notice prior to the Defect Claim
Date for any Environmental Defect, unless Buyers failure materially
prejudices SM Energys ability to cure an Environmental Defect prior to
Closing.

(b) _Remedies for Environmental Defects_. Subject to SM Energys continuing
right to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect or the Remediation
Amount asserted with respect thereto and subject to the Individual
Environmental Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible, in the event that any
Environmental Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with _Section
7.1(a)_ is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured on or before Closing, SM
Energy shall, at its sole option, elect to: 

 



27 (i) reduce the Purchase Price by the Remediation Amount for such
Environmental Defect;

(ii) retain the entirety of the Environmental Defect Property subject to such
Environmental Defect, together with all associated Assets, and reduce the
Purchase Price by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of the Environmental
Defect Property and associated Assets; or

 

(iii) with the prior written consent of Buyer, indemnify Buyer against all
Liability resulting from such Environmental Defect with respect to the Assets
pursuant to an indemnity agreement in a form mutually agreeable to the
Parties.

If SM Energy elects the option set forth in clause (i) above, Buyer shall be
deemed to have assumed responsibility for all costs and expenses attributable
to the Remediation of the applicable Environmental Defect (net to the Assets)
and all Liabilities (net to the Assets) with respect thereto, and Buyers
obligations with respect to the foregoing shall be deemed to constitute part
of the Assumed Obligations.

(c)  _Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to Buyers remedy for a breach of SM
Energys representation contained in _Section_ _3.12_ or for claims pursuant
to _Section 8.1_ (solely as to matters occurring between the Execution Date
and the Closing Date), _Section 13.2(d) or 13.2(g)_, _Section 7.1(b)_ shall
be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to any Environmental
Defect.

 

(d) _Environmental Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in
no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by SM Energy for (i) any individual Environmental Defect for
which the Remediation Amount does not exceed the Individual Environmental
Threshold, or (ii) any Environmental Defect for which the Remediation Amount
exceeds the Individual Environmental Threshold, unless the sum of (A) the
aggregate Remediation Amounts of all such Environmental Defects that exceed
the Individual Environmental Threshold (excluding any Remediation Amounts
attributable to (1) Environmental Defects cured by SM Energy or (2)
Environmental Defect Properties that SM Energy elects to retain pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)(ii)_), exceeds the Aggregate Environmental Deductible, after
which point Buyer shall only be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price
with respect to such Environmental Defects in excess of the Aggregate
Environmental Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, if SM Energy elects to
retain any Asset pursuant to  _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_, the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by the Allocated Value of such retained Asset and the Remediation
Amount for the Environmental Defect relating to such retained Asset will not
be counted towards the Aggregate Environmental Deductible. If a single
Environmental Defect or series of related Environmental Defects affects
several Well Locations in the same drilling or spacing unit, then such
Environmental Defect(s) shall be deemed to have exceeded the Individual
Environmental Threshold if the total amount by which such Environmental
Defect(s) reduce(s) the Allocated Value(s) of all the affected Well Locations
exceed(s) the Individual Environment Threshold.

 

(e) _Environmental Dispute Resolution_. The Parties agree to resolve disputes
concerning the existence and scope of an Environmental Defect or Remediation
Amount

 



28  pursuant to this _Section 7.1(e)_ (the " _Environmental Disputed Matters_
"). The Parties agree to attempt to initially resolve all disputes through
good faith negotiations. If the Parties cannot resolve disputes regarding
Environmental Disputed Matters on or before Closing, the Closing shall be
delayed as to only the Assets subject to the Environmental Disputed Matters
until the Parties finally resolve the dispute pursuant to this _Section
7.1(e)_; provided, however, if either Party asserts that the condition in
_Section 9.1(d)_ or _Section 9.2(d)_ has not been satisfied due, in whole or
in part, to Environmental Defects, then the Parties will resolve all
Environmental Disputed Matters pursuant to this _Section 7.1(e)_ prior to
Closing. In the event that neither Party asserts that the condition in
_Section 9.1(d)_ or  _Section 9.2(d)_ has not been satisfied, it is
understood and agreed that the Parties shall proceed to Closing as
contemplated herein as to all Assets not covered by an Environmental Disputed
Matter. The Environmental Disputed Matters will be finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 7.1(e)_. There will be a single arbitrator, who
must be an environmental attorney with at least 10 years experience in
environmental matters involving oil and gas properties, as selected by mutual
agreement of Buyer and SM Energy within 15 days after any Party invokes the
provisions of this _Section 7.1(e)_ to resolve such Dispute, and absent such
agreement, by the Houston office of the AAA (the " _Environmental Arbitrator_
"). The arbitration proceeding will be held in Houston, Texas and conducted in
accordance with the AAA Rules to the extent such rules do not conflict with
the terms of this _Section 7.1(e)_. The Environmental Arbitrators
determination must be made within 20 days after submission of the matters in
Dispute and shall be final and binding upon both Parties, without right of
appeal. In making its determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be
bound by the rules set forth in this _Section 7.1_ and, subject to the
foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the
Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a
proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator, however, may not award
Buyer a greater Remediation Amount than the Remediation Amount claimed by
Buyer in the applicable Environmental Defect Notice (which such award shall
not exceed the Allocated Value of the applicable Environmental Defect
Property). The Environmental Arbitrator will act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental Defects and/or
Remediation Amounts submitted by either Party and may not award damages,
interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. SM Energy
and Buyer will each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its
case. Each Party will bear one-half of the costs and expenses of
the Environmental Arbitrator. To the extent that the award of the
Environmental Arbitrator with respect to any Remediation Amount is not taken
into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price at Closing pursuant to
_Section 2.4_ and Buyer would otherwise be entitled to an adjustment under
the provisions of _Section 7.1(d)_, then, within 10 days after the
Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and SM Energy of
such award and subject to  _Section 7.1(d)_, the Purchase Price will be
adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.4_ by such Remediation Amount.

_7.2 NORM, Wastes and Other Substances._

Buyer acknowledges that the Assets have been used for exploration, development
and production of oil and gas and that there may be petroleum, produced
water, wastes or other substances or materials located in, on or under or
associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites included in the Assets may
contain asbestos, NORM or other Hazardous Substances. NORM may affix or
attach itself to the inside of wells, materials and equipment as scale, or in
other forms. The wells, materials and equipment located on the Assets or
included in the Assets may contain

 



29  NORM and other wastes or Hazardous Substances. NORM containing material or
other wastes or Hazardous Substances may have come in contact with various
environmental media, including without limitation, water, soils or sediment.
Special procedures may be required for the assessment, remediation, removal,
transportation or disposal of environmental media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and
other Hazardous Substances from the Assets.

auditors from any and all Proceedings, and Losses whatsoever, in law or in
equity, known or unknown, which any member of the Buyer Indemnified

WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY SM INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

ARTICLE X

TAX MATTERS 

_10.1 Asset Tax Liability._

 

Subject to the treatment of ad valorem Taxes provided below, all Asset Taxes
shall be allocated between Buyer and SM Energy as of the Effective Time for
all taxable periods that include the Effective Time. All Asset Taxes that are
not ad valorem taxes shall be allocated to SM Energy to the extent they relate
to production prior to the Effective Time and to Buyer to the extent they 

 



34  relate to production on or after the Effective Time. No liability for Asset
Taxes shall duplicate an adjustment to Purchase Price made pursuant to
_Section 2.4_. Ad valorem Taxes for each assessment period shall be
allocated to SM Energy based on the percentage of the assessment period
occurring before the Effective Time and to Buyer based on the percentage of
the assessment period occurring on or after the Effective Time. Each Party
shall promptly furnish to the other copies of any Asset Tax assessments and
statements (or invoices therefor from the operator of the Assets) received by
it to the extent such assessment, statement, or invoice relates to an Asset
Tax allocable to the other Party under this _Section 10.1_. Each Party shall
timely pay all Asset Taxes subject to allocation under this Section and shall
furnish to the other Party evidence of such payment. The Parties shall
estimate all Asset Taxes that are attributable to the ownership or operation
of the Assets through the Closing Date and all Subject Transfer Taxes and
incorporate such estimates into the Preliminary Settlement Statement. The
actual amounts (to the extent the actual amounts differ from the estimates
included in the Preliminary Settlement Statement and are known at the time of
the Final Settlement Statement) shall be accounted for in the Final Settlement
Statement. If the actual amounts are not known at the time of the Final
Settlement Statement, the amounts shall be re-estimated based on the best
information available at the time of the Final Settlement Statement. When the
actual amounts are known, Buyer or SM Energy shall make such payments to the
other (if any) as are necessary to effect the allocation of Taxes described
in this _Section 10.1_.

_10.2 Transfer Taxes._

 

All sales, use or other Taxes (other than Taxes on gross income, net income or
gross receipts), duties, levies, recording fees or other governmental
charges incurred by or imposed with respect to the property transfers
undertaken pursuant to this Agreement (" _Subject Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be
the responsibility of, and shall be paid by, Buyer. The Parties shall
reasonably cooperate in taking steps that would minimize or eliminate any
Subject Transfer Taxes. Buyer agrees to file all Subject Transfer Tax Returns
relating to such Subject Transfer Taxes.

 

 _10.3 Asset Tax Reports and Returns._

 

For Asset Tax periods in which the Effective Time occurs, SM Energy agrees to
immediately forward to Buyer copies of any Asset Tax reports and Tax
Returns received or filed by SM Energy after the Closing and provide Buyer
with any information SM Energy has that is reasonably necessary for Buyer to
file any required Tax Return related to the Assets. Buyer agrees to file all
Tax Returns and reports applicable to the Assets that Buyer is required to
file after the Closing and, subject to the provisions of _Section 10.1_, to
pay all required Asset Taxes payable with respect to the Assets.

 

 _10.4 Tax Cooperation._

Buyer and SM Energy shall cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of any Tax Returns
and any audit, litigation or other proceeding (each, a " _Tax Proceeding_ ")
with respect to Taxes relating to or in connection with the Assets. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Partys request)
the provision of such records and information which are reasonably relevant to
any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder.

 



35 _10.5 Indemnity Payments._

 

Buyer and SM Energy agree to treat any payment made pursuant to the
indemnification provisions of this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for Tax purposes.

ARTICLE XII

ACQUISITION TERMINATION AND REMEDIES

_12.1 Right of Termination._

 

This Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein may be terminated at
any time at or prior to Closing:

 

(a) by SM Energy, if any of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.2_ (other
than the conditions set forth in  _Section 9.2(d)_) have not been satisfied
by Buyer on or before December 30, 2016 (the " _Outside Termination Date_ ");

 



37 (b) by Buyer, if any of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_ (other than
the conditions set forth in _Section 9.1(d)_) have not been satisfied by SM
Energy on or before the Outside Termination Date;

(c) by SM Energy if the condition set forth in _Section 9.2(d)_ is not
satisfied on or before the Outside Termination Date or by Buyer if the
condition set forth in _Section 9.1(d)_ has not been satisfied on or before
the Outside Termination Date; or

(d) by the mutual written agreement of Buyer and SM Energy;

 

provided, however, that no Party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _clause (a)_ or _(b)_ above if such Party or its
Affiliates are at such time in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement.

_12.2 Effect of Termination._

 

(a) If the obligation to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to any provision of  _Section 12.1_, then, except as
set forth in _Section 12.2(b)_ and _Section 12.2(c)_ and except for the
provisions of (x) _Section 2.3_, _Sections 5.1(c)_ through _5.1(g)_ , 
_Section 5.2_, _Section 5.3_, this _Section 12.2_, _Section 13.9_, and
_Section 14.7,_ and (y) such terms as set forth in this Agreement in order to
give context to any of the surviving Sections, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and the Parties shall have no liability or obligation hereunder,
except and to the extent such termination results from the material breach by
a Party of any of its covenants or agreements hereunder, in which case the
non-breaching Party shall be entitled to the Deposit, damages, or specific
performance as hereinafter provided.

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by SM Energy pursuant to _Section
12.1(a)_, SM Energy has performed or is ready, willing and able to perform
all of its agreements and covenants contained herein in all material respects
which are to be performed or observed at Closing, and Buyer has failed to
perform or observe any of its agreements or covenants contained herein which
are to be performed or observed at Closing, then except for the remedies
provided in _Section 12.2(d)_, SM Energy shall receive and retain the Deposit
as liquidated damages as SM Energys sole and exclusive remedy for any breach
or failure to perform by Buyer under this Agreement, except for the
indemnities provided in _Section 5.1(c)_, and all other rights and remedies
arising under this Agreement (except for the provisions that survive pursuant
to  _Section 12.2(a),_ which shall remain in full force and effect) are
hereby expressly waived by SM Energy. SM Energy and Buyer agree upon the
Deposit as liquidated damages due to the difficulty and inconvenience of
measuring actual damages and the uncertainty thereof, and SM Energy and Buyer
agree that such amount would be a reasonable estimate of SM Energys loss in
the event of any such breach or failure to perform by Buyer. In lieu of
termination of this Agreement, subject to  _Section 13.9_, SM Energy shall
be entitled to specific performance of this Agreement as provided below.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to _Section 12.1(b)_,
Buyer has performed or is ready, willing and able to perform all of its
agreements and covenants contained herein in all material respects which are
to be performed or observed at Closing, and

 



38  SM Energy has failed to perform or observe any of its agreements or
covenants contained herein which are to be performed or observed at Closing,
SM Energy shall cause the Deposit to be returned to Buyer and Buyer shall be
entitled to seek money damages from SM Energy available at Law for SM Energys
applicable breach of this Agreement subject to _Section 13.9_, as Buyers
sole and exclusive remedy for any breach or failure to perform by SM Energy
under this Agreement (except for the remedies provided in _Section 12.2(d)_),
and all other rights and remedies arising under this Agreement (except for the
provisions that survive pursuant to  _Section 12.2(a)_, which shall remain
in full force and effect) are hereby expressly waived by Buyer, and SM Energy
shall be free immediately to enjoy all rights of ownership of the Assets and
to sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of the Assets to any Person
without any restriction under this Agreement. In lieu of termination of this
Agreement, Buyer shall be entitled to specific performance of this Agreement
as provided below.

 

(d) In lieu of termination of this Agreement, the Parties expressly agree that
monetary damages will be insufficient to compensate them for their damages
and as such each of Buyer and SM Energy agree that the Party with the right to
terminate this Agreement shall in lieu thereof be entitled to exercise the
remedy of specific performance under this Agreement. Prior to exercising
the remedy of specific performance under this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 12.2(d)_, the Party entitled thereto must deliver notice in writing
to the other Party stating its election to exercise such remedy under this 
_Section 12.2(d)_ within thirty (30) days counted from and after the
Termination Date. If the Party entitled to exercise the remedy of specific
performance elects to exercise such remedy pursuant to this _Section
12.2(d)_, the Deposit shall continue to be held by the Escrow Agent, until a
non-appealable final judgment or award on the claim of specific performance is
rendered, or if specific performance is not granted, the Deposit shall be paid
to the Party that was entitled to terminate this Agreement, or as otherwise
provided in _Section 2.3(b)_, as applicable. After such judgment is rendered,
the Parties will issue a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to
distribute the Deposit pursuant to such judgment. The Parties hereby agree
not to raise, and hereby waive, any objections to the availability of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
agreements of the Parties under this Agreement. The Party entitled to exercise
specific performance as a remedy under this Agreement shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security, or to prove irreparable injury or harm,
in connection with seeking an injunction or injunctions to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The Parties hereto
further agree that (x) by seeking the specific performance provided for in
this paragraph, including by the institution of a court proceeding, the Party
entitled to seek such specific performance shall not in any respect waive its
right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to it under this
Agreement (including those related to termination of this Agreement) in the
event that the specific performance provided for in this paragraph are not
available or otherwise are not granted, and (y) nothing set forth in this
paragraph shall require such Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit
such Partys right to institute a proceeding for) such remedies prior to or as
a condition of exercising any termination right under this _Section 12.2_,
nor shall the commencement of any proceeding pursuant to this paragraph
restrict or limit such Partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with this _Section 12.2_.

 



39 _12.3 Return of Documentation and Confidentiality._

 

Upon termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall return to SM Energy all title,
engineering, geological and geophysical data, environmental assessments
or reports, maps and other information furnished by SM Energy to Buyer or, if
not destroyed by Buyer, prepared by or on behalf of Buyer in connection with
its due diligence investigation of the Assets, in each case, in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement.

_13.7 Indemnification Procedures._

 

All claims for indemnification under _Section 5.1(c)_, _Section 13.2_ and
_Section 13.3_ shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of this _Article XIII_, the term " _Indemnifying Party_ ",
when used in connection with particular Liabilities, shall mean the Party
having an obligation to indemnify another Party or Person(s) with respect to
such Liabilities pursuant to this _Article XIII_, and the term "
_Indemnified Party_ ", when used in connection with particular Liabilities,
shall mean the Party or Person(s) having the right to be indemnified with
respect to such Liabilities by another Party pursuant to this _Article XIII_.

 



43 (b) To make claim for indemnification under _Section 5.1(c)_, _Section
13.2_ or _Section 13.3_, an Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying
Party of its claim under this _Section 13.7_, including the specific details
of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the "
_Claim Notice_ "). In the event that the claim for indemnification is based
upon a claim by a third party against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim Notice promptly
after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Third Party Claim and
shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Third
Party Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice
of a Third Party Claim as provided in this _Section_ _13.7_ shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under _Section 5.1(c)_,
_Section 13.2_ or _Section 13.3_ (as applicable) except to the extent such
failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the
Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Third Party Claim or
otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend
against the claim. In the event that the claim for indemnification is based
upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or breached.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have fifteen (15) days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is
authorized, prior to and during such fifteen (15) day period, at the expense
of the Indemnifying Party, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that
it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of
the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its obligation to indemnify a Third
Party Claim, it shall have the right and obligation to diligently defend, at
its sole cost and expense, the Third Party Claim provided that, where the
Third Party Claim consists of (i) a civil, criminal or regulatory proceeding,
action, indictment or investigation against the Indemnified Party by any
Governmental Authority, (ii) a claim in which the Indemnifying Party is also a
party and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that
joint representation would be inappropriate, or (iii) a claim that primarily
seeks injunctive or other non-monetary or equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall at its option have the right to
control the defense and proceedings. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, the Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in
contesting any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest
(provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall not be required to bring
any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person). The Indemnified
Party may participate in, but not control, at its own expense, any defense or
settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this _Section 13.7(d)_. An Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle any Third
Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto that
(i) does not result in a final resolution of the Indemnified 

 



44  Partys Liability in respect of such Third Party Claim (including in the
case of a settlement an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party
from all Liability in respect of such Third Party Claim), (ii) results in a
finding or admission of any violation of Law or the violation of the rights of
any Person or subjects the Indemnified Party to other Third Party Claims or
(iii) in any manner may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party
(other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnification
obligations hereunder).

 

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its obligation to indemnify and
bear all expenses associated with a Third Party Claim or admits its
obligation to indemnify and bear all expenses associated with a Third Party
Claim but fails to diligently prosecute or settle the Third Party Claim, then
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the Third Party
Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of
the Indemnified Partys choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying
Party to admit its obligation to indemnify and bear all expenses associated
with a Third Party Claim and assume the defense of the Third Party Claim at
any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its obligation to indemnify and bear
all expenses associated with a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and
the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for 10 Business Days following
receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation to indemnify
and bear all expenses associated with a Third Party Claim and (ii) if such
obligation is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed
settlement. Any failure to respond to such notice by the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed to be an election under (ii) of the preceding sentence.

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to (i) cure the Liabilities complained of, (ii) admit its obligation to
indemnify for and bear all expenses associated with such Liability or (iii)
dispute the claim for such Liabilities. If the Indemnifying Party does not
notify the Indemnified Party within such 30 day period that it has cured the
Liabilities or that it disputes the claim for such Liabilities, the amount of
such Liabilities shall conclusively be deemed a liability of the Indemnifying
Party hereunder.

_13.8 Survival._

 

(a) The representations and warranties of SM Energy contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing until the date that is the
first anniversary date of the Closing Date and expire thereafter; provided
however, that the Fundamental Representations shall survive until sixty (60)
days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period.
The covenants and agreements of SM Energy and of Buyer contained in this
Agreement to be performed prior to the Closing Date shall, in each case,
survive the Closing until the date that is the first anniversary date of the
Closing Date and expire thereafter, and all other covenants and agreements of
SM Energy and Buyer contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing
until fully performed, subject however to applicable statutes of limitation.
The representations and warranties of Buyer contained in  _Article IV_ shall
survive the Closing without time limit, subject to applicable statutes of
limitations. Representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall be of
no further force and effect after the date of their expiration; provided that
there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement prior to its expiration date.

 



45 (b) The indemnities in _Section 13.2(a)_, _Section 13.2(b)_,  _Section
13.3(a)_ and _Section 13.3(b)_ shall terminate as of the termination date of
each respective representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is
subject to indemnification as set forth in _Section 13.8(a)_. The
indemnities contained in _Section 13.2(h)_ shall survive the Closing without
time limit, subject to applicable statutes of limitation, and Buyers
indemnities contained in _Section 13.3(c)_ and/or  _Section 13.3(d)_ shall
survive the Closing without time limit, subject to applicable statutes of
limitation. The indemnities in _Section 13.2(c), Section 13.2(e), Section
13.2(f) _and _Section 13.2(g) _shall terminate after the expiration of five
hundred and forty eight (548) days after the Closing Date. The indemnities in
_Section 13.2(d) _shall survive the Closing indefinitely, subject to
expiration under applicable statues of limitations. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim asserted
pursuant to the indemnities in _Section 13.2_ or _Section 13.3_ prior to the
date of termination for such indemnity.

 

 _13.9 Non-Compensatory Damages._

 

None of the Buyer Indemnified Parties or SM Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to recover from SM Energy or Buyer, as applicable, or their
respective Affiliates, any indirect, consequential (including consequential
damages for lost profits), punitive or exemplary damages of any kind arising
under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except to the extent any such Party suffers such damages
(including costs of defense and reasonable attorneys fees incurred in
connection with defending of such damages) to a third party, which damages
(including costs of defense and reasonable attorneys fees incurred in
connection with defending against such damages) shall not be excluded by this
provision as to recovery hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, Buyer,
on behalf of each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, and SM Energy, on behalf
of each of SM Indemnified Parties, each waive any right to recover punitive,
special, exemplary and consequential damages, including consequential damages
for lost profits of any kind, arising in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This _Section 13.9_
shall not restrict Buyers right to obtain specific performance or other
equitable remedies (other than rescission) pursuant to _Section 12.2._
