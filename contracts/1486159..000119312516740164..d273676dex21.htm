the royalty measurement meters, delivery point sales meters or custody transfer meters on the gathering lines or pipelines through which they are transported (whichever meter is closest to the well). SM Energy shall utilize reasonable interpolative

negotiations. If the Parties cannot resolve disputes regarding Environmental Disputed Matters on or before Closing, the Closing shall be delayed as to only the Assets subject to the Environmental Disputed Matters until the Parties finally resolve
the dispute pursuant to this <I>Section&nbsp;7.1(e)</I>; provided, however, if either Party asserts that the condition in <I>Section&nbsp;9.1(d)</I> or <I>Section&nbsp;9.2(d)</I> has not been satisfied due, in whole or in part, to Environmental
Defects, then the Parties will resolve all Environmental Disputed Matters pursuant to this <I>Section&nbsp;7.1(e)</I> prior to Closing. In the event that neither Party asserts that the condition in <I>Section&nbsp;9.1(d)</I> or
<I>Section&nbsp;9.2(d)</I> has not been satisfied, it is understood and agreed that the Parties shall proceed to Closing as contemplated herein as to all Assets not covered by an Environmental Disputed Matter. The Environmental Disputed Matters will
be finally determined pursuant to this <I>Section&nbsp;7.1(e)</I>. There will be a single arbitrator, who must be an environmental attorney with at least 10 years&#146; experience in environmental matters involving oil and gas properties, as
selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and SM Energy within 15 days after any Party invokes the provisions of this <I>Section&nbsp;7.1(e)</I> to resolve such Dispute, and absent such agreement, by the Houston office of the AAA (the

The Environmental Arbitrator&#146;s determination must be made within 20 days after submission of the matters in Dispute and shall be final and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making its determination, the Environmental
Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this <I>Section&nbsp;7.1</I> and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper
determination. The Environmental Arbitrator, however, may not award Buyer a greater Remediation Amount than the Remediation Amount claimed by Buyer in the applicable Environmental Defect Notice (which such award shall not exceed the Allocated Value
of the applicable Environmental Defect Property). The Environmental Arbitrator will act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental Defects and/or Remediation Amounts submitted by either Party and may not
award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. SM Energy and Buyer will each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Each Party will bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the
Environmental Arbitrator. To the extent that the award of the Environmental Arbitrator with respect to any Remediation Amount is not taken into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price at Closing pursuant to <I>Section&nbsp;2.4</I> and Buyer
would otherwise be entitled to an adjustment under the provisions of <I>Section&nbsp;7.1(d)</I>, then, within 10 days after the Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and SM Energy of such award and subject to
<I>Section&nbsp;7.1(d)</I>, the Purchase Price will be adjusted pursuant to <I>Section&nbsp;2.4</I> by such Remediation Amount. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>7.2
