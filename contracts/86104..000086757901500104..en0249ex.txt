Knowledge of the Company,  is there any event that with notice or lapse of time,
or both,  would constitute such a default  thereunder;  and (iv) the Company has
not  received  notice that any party to any such  Contract  or lease  intends to

exercise any option or other right thereunder.

that are  reasonably  likely  to result in any such  investigation.

     3.12 Labor Matters

     Except  as set  forth  on the  Disclosure  Schedule  3.12,  (a) none of the

as an Employee by any labor  organization,  the Company has not  recognized  any

     3.13 Employee  Benefit Plans

     (a) Disclosure  Schedule  3.13(a)  contains a complete and accurate list of
all  material  employee  benefit  plans,  policies,  programs  and  arrangements
(including,  without  limitation,  all "employee  benefit  plans," as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA, stock bonus,  equity and equity-based  plans,  employment
and consulting  agreements,  and retention,  change in control,  termination and
severance pay plans and arrangements) sponsored, maintained or contributed to by
the  Company or any ERISA  Affiliate  for the  benefit of any  current or former
Employee  and for which the  Company  has or could have any  material  liability
(such plans,  policies,  programs and arrangements  are hereinafter  referred to
collectively as "Employee Benefit Plans",  and each individually as an "Employee
Benefit  Plan").  Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any agreement,
arrangement, commitment or obligation to create, enter into or contribute to any
additional  Employee  Benefit Plan, or to modify or amend any existing  Employee


<PAGE>

Benefit Plan (except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable Law). For
purposes of this  Agreement  "ERISA  Affiliate"  means any  corporation,  trade,
business,  partnership,  limited liability company, sole proprietorship or other
entity that is, or at any relevant time, was treated as single employer with the
Company under Section 414(b),  (c), (m) or (o) of the Code.  Disclosure Schedule
3.13(a)  separately  identifies  each  Employee  Benefit  Plan  sponsored by the
Company  (each,  a "Company  Benefit  Plan").  Shareholder  or the  Company  has
provided or made  available to Buyer a true,  correct and  complete  copy of (i)
each  Employee  Benefit  Plan as  currently  in effect  (or, in the case of each
unwritten Employee Benefit Plan, a written  description of such Employee Benefit
Plan), (ii) the most recent determination  letter, if any, received from the IRS
with  respect to each  Employee  Benefit  Plan that is intended to be  qualified
under  Section  401(a) of the  Code,  and (iii)  the most  recent  summary  plan
description,  if any,  distributed to participants with respect to each Employee
Benefit Plan, that is subject to Section 102 of ERISA.

     (b) Each Employee  Benefit Plan has been maintained and administered in all
material  respects  in  accordance  with its  terms and in  compliance  with all
applicable Laws, including,  without limitation, ERISA and the Code. Neither the
Company nor, to the Knowledge of Shareholder,  any other Person has engaged in a
nonexempt  "prohibited  transaction,"  as defined in Sections 406 through 408 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code,  with  respect to any  Employee  Benefit Plan
which  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  subject  the  Company  to a material
liability.

     (c) Each  Employee  Benefit  Plan that is  intended to be  qualified  under
Section   401(a)  of  the  Code  is  the  subject  of  an  unrevoked   favorable
determination  letter from the IRS with respect to such Employee  Benefit Plan's
qualified  status under the Code. To the Knowledge of  Shareholder,  nothing has
occurred  that could  reasonably  be expected  to have an adverse  effect on the
qualification  of any such  Employee  Benefit  Plan or the tax  exemption of its
related trust.

     (d) All  contributions  required to be paid by the Company to each Employee
Benefit Plan for periods  ending prior to the date hereof have been timely paid,
or,  if not  yet  due,  have  been  accrued  as a  liability  on  the  Financial
Statements.

     (e) Except as set forth on Disclosure Schedule 3.13(e), during the last six
(6) years,  neither  the  Company  nor any ERISA  Affiliate  has  maintained  or
contributed  to  (or  been  obligated  to  maintain  or  contribute  to),  (i) a
"multiemployer  plan"  as  defined  in  Section  4001(a)(3)  of ERISA  (each,  a
"Multiemployer  Plan"),  (ii) a multiple  employer  plan  within the  meaning of
Section  4063 or 4064 of  ERISA  or  Section  413(c)  of the  Code,  or (iii) an
employee benefit plan, fund, program, contract or arrangement that is subject to
Section  412 of the Code,  Section  302 of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA  (each,  a
"Title IV Plan").


<PAGE>

                (i) Neither the Company nor any ERISA  Affiliate has incurred
any liability (that will not be satisfied prior to the Closing Date) under Title
IV of ERISA as a result of the  termination  of any Title IV Plan.  All premiums
due and owing to the Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation  (the  "PBGC") with
respect to each Title IV Plan have been  timely  paid.  No  proceeding  has been
initiated  or, to the  Knowledge of  Shareholder,  threatened by the PBGC or any
other Person  under Title IV of ERISA to  terminate  (or to appoint a trustee or
administrator  of) any Title IV Plan nor, to the  Knowledge of  Shareholder,  is
there a reasonable  basis for the  commencement  of any such  proceeding  by the
PBGC. No event has occurred or, to the Knowledge of  Shareholder,  is threatened
or about to  occur  (other  than  the  transactions  contemplated  in or by this
Agreement or the other Transaction  Documents) with respect to any Title IV Plan
that would  constitute a  "reportable  event," as defined in Section  4043(c) of
ERISA for which the thirty (30) day notice  requirement of Section 4043 of ERISA
has not been waived. The present value of the "benefit  liabilities," as defined
in Section  4001(a)(16) of ERISA under each Title IV Plan (determined  using the
actuarial  methods and assumptions  used for funding purposes in the most recent
actuarial  report  prepared  for  such  Title IV Plan) as of the end of the most
recent  plan year of such Title IV Plan do not  exceed by a material  amount the
assets  available  under such Title IV Plan to pay such benefits.  The actuarial
assumptions  contained  in the most recent  actuarial  report  prepared for each
Title IV Plan are, in the aggregate,  reasonable.

                (ii) No Employee Benefit Plan that is subject to the  funding
requirements of Section 412 of the Code has an "accumulated funding deficiency,"
as defined in such section, whether or not waived.

                (iii) Neither the Company nor any ERISA  Affiliate has provided,
or is required to provide,  security to any Employee  Benefit Plan pursuant to
Section 401(a)(29) of the Code, nor has any lien been imposed  against the
assets of the Company  or any ERISA  Affiliate  under  Section  412(n) of the
Code or  Section 302(f) of ERISA.

                (iv) None of Shareholder,  the Company, any ERISA Affiliate or,
to the  Knowledge of  Shareholder,  any  organization  to which any of them is a
successor or parent corporation (within the meaning of Section 4069(b) of ERISA)
has engaged in a  transaction  that could  reasonably be expected to result in a
material liability to the Company under Section 4069 of ERISA.

     (f)  Except  as set  forth on  Disclosure  Schedule  3.13(f),  there are no
actions, suits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits) pending or, to
the Knowledge of  Shareholder  and the Company,  threatened  with respect to (or
against the assets of) any  Employee  Benefit  Plan,  nor, to the  Knowledge  of
Shareholder or the Company,  is there a reasonable  basis for any such claim. To
the  Knowledge  of  Shareholder  or the  Company,  no Employee  Benefit  Plan is
currently under investigation,  audit or review, directly or indirectly,  by the
IRS, the DOL, the PBGC or any other Governmental  Entity,  and, to the Knowledge
of  Shareholder  or the  Company,  no  such  action  is  contemplated  or  under
consideration  by the IRS, the DOL, the PBGC or any other  Governmental  Entity.



<PAGE>

     (g) Except as  required  by  applicable  Law or as set forth on  Disclosure
Schedule  3.13(g),  neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
other   Transaction   Documents  nor  the   consummation  of  the   transactions
contemplated  hereby and thereby,  will (i) entitle any  individual to severance
pay,  unemployment  compensation  or any other  payment from the  Company,  (ii)
otherwise  increase the amount of compensation  due to any individual or forgive
indebtedness  owed by any  individual,  (iii)  result  in any  benefit  or right
becoming established or increased,  or accelerate the time of payment or vesting
of any benefit,  under any Employee Benefit Plan, or (iv) require the Company to
transfer or set aside any assets to fund or  otherwise  provide for any benefits
for any individual.

     (h)  Except  as set  forth  on  Disclosure  Schedule  3.13(h),  none of the
Employee Benefit Plans provides for  post-employment  life or health  insurance,
benefits or coverage for any  participant  or any  beneficiary of a participant,
except as may be required by  applicable  Law,  including,  without  limitation,
Section  4980B of the Code and Part 6 of  Subtitle  B of Title I of  ERISA.  The
Company  and each ERISA  Affiliate  that  maintains  a "group  health  plan," as
defined in Section  5000(b)(1) of the Code,  is in good faith  compliance in all
material respects with the notice and continuation  requirements of Section 4980
of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA.

     (i) Any  individual  who  performs  services  for the  Company  (other than
through a Contract with an organization  other than such  individual) and who is
not treated as an Employee for U.S.  federal  income Tax purposes by the Company
is not an employee for such purposes.

     3.14  Intellectual  Property

     (a) Disclosure  Schedule 3.14(a) lists all trademarks,  trade names,  brand
names,  service  marks,  logos or other  identifiers  owned by the Company  (the
"Owned Marks").

     (b) Disclosure  Schedule 3.14(b) lists all trademarks,  trade names,  brand
names,  service marks,  logos or other identifiers owned by Shareholder and used
by the Company in the operation of its business  (together with the Owned Marks,
the  "Marks"),  and the Company has the  present  right (and  subject to Section
5.5(b)  will  continue  to have the  right  following  the  consummation  of the
transactions  contemplated hereby) to use all Marks.

     (c) To the  Knowledge  of the Company,  none of the Marks or the  Company's
rights thereto are being infringed upon or otherwise violated by any Person.

     (d) The use of the Marks by the Company does not infringe upon or otherwise
violate any rights of any Person,  and there is no pending or, to the  Knowledge
of the Company, threatened Claim alleging any such infringement or violation. In
addition,  there is no pending or, to the  Knowledge of the Company,  threatened
Claim alleging any defect in or invalidity,  misuse or  unenforceability  of, or
challenging the ownership or use of or the Company's rights with respect to, any
of the Marks and, to the  Knowledge  of the  Company,  there is no basis for any
such  Claim.


<PAGE>

     (e) The software  license  agreements  identified  on  Disclosure  Schedule
3.10(a),  together with the arrangements contemplated by the Transition Services
Agreement,  represent all licenses of software and systems  necessary to conduct

occurrence-based  policies  of  insurance  that  insure  the  assets,  business,
Property,  operations,  prospects  or  affairs  of the  Company or relate to the

of the date hereof.  Insurance  against loss or damage by fire or other casualty
(including  extended  coverage)  on  all  Company  Property,   including  Leased
Property,  is maintained by  Shareholder  for the benefit of the Company;  which
insurance shall terminate as of the Closing.  All insurance policies  maintained
for the benefit of the Company are in full force and effect,  all  premiums  due
and owing up to and including the Closing Date have been paid,  and no notice of
cancellation  or termination  has been received with respect to any such policy.

     (b) With respect to each of the insurance  policies set forth on Disclosure

     (b) Except as set forth on  Disclosure  Schedule  3.17(b),  (i) neither the

reasonable notice and in such manner as will not unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the  Company's  business,  to the  Company's  senior  management  and
members of its integration team and Books and Records, as Buyer may from time to
time  request,  for the  purposes of  familiarizing  itself  with the  Company's

preparation,   negotiation   and  delivery  of  this  Agreement  and  the  other
Transaction  Documents and the  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated
herein and therein shall be subject to the  provisions of and kept  confidential

employment  records in its possession in respect of Transferred  Employees.

     (d) Following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall afford Buyer or
its Affiliates  reasonable  assistance in contacting the  counterparties  to the

counterparties   the  treatment  of  such   Derivative   Agreements  and  Credit
Enhancements following the Closing Date.

obligation to purchase or sell the Shares insofar as such matters are within the

case may be), or (ii)  prohibit or restrain or materially  and adversely  affect
the  consummation of the transactions by such party  contemplated  hereby or the
performance of its obligations hereunder.

     (b)  Shareholder  shall,  and shall  cause its  Affiliates  (other than the
Company) to, conduct their respective  business  relationships  with the Company
only  in the  ordinary  and  usual  course  of  business  consistent  with  past

arrangements  with third parties;  provided,  however,  that the continuation of
intercompany  services to the Company by  Shareholder or its Affiliates on terms
consistent  with past  practices and similar to the terms on which such services

warranty  been made as of the time of  occurrence  or  discovery of such fact or
condition.

     (d) Between the date hereof and until the  Closing,  Shareholder  and Buyer
shall promptly  notify the other of the occurrence of any breach of any covenant
of such  party or of the  occurrence  of any  event  that any such  party in its

such party to close pursuant to Articles 7 and 8, as  applicable,  impossible or
unlikely.

     (e)  Between  the date hereof and until the  Closing,  Shareholder  and the
Company  shall  promptly  notify  Buyer in the event that any  Employee who is a

     (a) Transfer of Assets.  Shareholder shall, and shall cause the Company to,
take the following  actions (on terms and  conditions  reasonably  acceptable to
Buyer), prior to the Closing,  which actions shall be effective for all purposes
(other  than for Tax  purposes)  immediately  prior to the  Reference  Time (all
actions  necessary  in  connection  therewith  being  hereinafter   collectively
referred to as the "Restructuring"):

                (i) Shareholder shall transfer, or cause to
be  transferred,  to the  Company  on an "as is,  where is" basis,  without  any
representation or warranty from Shareholder as to its condition or fitness for a

interest  in and to  each  of the  Transferred  Assets  free  and  clear  of all
Encumbrances.

              (ii) Shareholder shall cause the Company to transfer on an "as is,
where is" basis,  without any  representation  or warranty  from the Company and
without recourse to the Company,  all of the Company's right, title and interest

                (i) Effective  upon Closing,  Shareholder  shall  terminate
coverage with respect to the Company under all insurance policies  maintained by
Shareholder or its Affiliates; provided, however, that no "occurrence" liability
policies shall be terminated in such a manner as to prevent Buyer or the Company
from  recovering  under such policies for losses from events  occurring prior to
the Closing; provided,  further, that Shareholder,  at Buyer's election and sole
expense, shall take commercially reasonable steps to extend the reporting period
with respect to pre-Closing  events under any "claims-made"  insurance  policies
designated  by Buyer in order to permit  Buyer and the Company to recover  under

based on events  occurring  after the Closing with respect to the Company or its
business or Properties.

                (ii) Notwithstanding  Section 5.8(b)(i),  to the extent
that (A) any insurance policies owned or controlled by Shareholder or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company)  ("Shareholder's  Insurance Policies") cover
any loss,  liability,  Claim,  damage or expense  relating to the Company or its
business  or  Properties  ("Subject  Company  Liabilities")  and  relating to or
arising out of occurrences  prior to the Closing,  (B)  Shareholder's  Insurance
Policies permit Claims with respect to Subject Company  Liabilities  relating to
or arising out of occurrences  prior to the Closing  ("Subject  Company Claims")
and (C) either Shareholder or Buyer elects to submit or pursue a Subject Company

Affiliates to,  cooperate in submitting such Subject Company Claims (or pursuing
Subject Company Claims  previously  made) on behalf of Buyer or the Company,  as
applicable,  under Shareholder's  Insurance Policies.  The expenses with respect
thereto  shall be borne by the party  electing to submit or pursue such  Subject
Company  Claim.

with respect to any matter,  condition or occurrence hereafter arising which, if
existing or occurring at the effective date of this  Agreement,  would have been
required to have been set forth or  described  in such  Disclosure  Schedules or
would otherwise have been inconsistent with their  representations or warranties
herein.  No  supplement or amendment by either party shall be deemed to cure (or
affect the rights of any party with respect to) any breach of any representation
or  warranty  made in this  Agreement  or have any  effect  for the  purpose  of
determining  satisfaction  of the  conditions set forth in Articles 7 and 8.

     (a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Shareholder shall cause one or more of
its Affiliates (other than the Company),  to hire the Excluded Employees.  After
the Closing, Buyer or one of its Affiliates (which Affiliate may be the Company)
shall offer  employment  to any  Excluded  Employee  who was  inactive as of the

situated  employees of Buyer. Buyer and its Affiliates shall recognize (or cause
to be recognized) each Transferred  Employee's  service with the Company and its

benefit plan, policy,  program or arrangement  (including vacations,  sick leave
and holidays) maintained by Buyer or one of its Affiliates (collectively, "Buyer
Benefit  Plans") in which such  Transferred  Employee  becomes a participant (or
which  covers  such  Transferred  Employee)  on or after  the  Closing  Date for
purposes of any waiting period,  vesting,  eligibility and benefit  entitlement;
provided,  however,  that with  respect  to any Buyer  Benefit  Plan  which is a
defined  benefit  pension plan,  as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA,  in which

<PAGE>

such Transferred Employee participates  following the Closing Date, such service
credit shall be measured from the earliest date that such  Transferred  Employee
commenced participation in a tax-qualified pension or savings plan maintained by
the Company or one of its  Affiliates  and shall not be taken into account under
such plan for  purposes  of  calculating  such  Transferred  Employee's  benefit
accruals.  Buyer and its Affiliates will waive,  or cause to be waived,  any and
all pre-existing  condition  limitations and exclusions and eligibility  waiting
periods  under each Buyer  Benefit  Plan that is an  "employee  welfare  benefit
plan," as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, with respect to (i) each Transferred
Employee who,  immediately prior to the Closing,  participated in a similar plan
maintained or contributed to by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, and (ii) the
spouse and eligible dependents of each such Transferred  Employee (provided such
spouse  and  dependents  were  participating  in a similar  plan  maintained  or
contributed to by the Company or any ERISA  Affiliate  immediately  prior to the
Closing) (once such plan is made available to Transferred Employees).  Buyer and
its  Affiliates  will  recognize,  for  purposes  of any annual  deductible  and
out-of-pocket  limits  under  each  Buyer  Benefit  Plan  that is a health  plan
(including without limitation, Buyer's medical and dental plans), deductible and
out-of-pocket  expenses  paid by  Transferred  Employees  and their  spouses and
dependents  during the calendar  year in which the Closing Date occurs under the
health plans maintained or contributed to by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate.
For purposes of this Section  6.2(b),  the term  "Transferred  Employees"  shall
include  (i)  Transferred  Employees,  as  defined in  Section  1.167,  and (ii)
Excluded  Employees who are hired by Buyer or one of its  Affiliates  (including
the  Company)  pursuant  to  Section  6.2(a).

who are  terminated by the Company at or after the Closing,  including,  but not
limited to, payments due under the Company Special Severance Arrangements.

     (d)  Buyer  shall be  solely  responsible  for  making  COBRA  continuation
coverage available with respect to all Transferred  Employees (and any qualified
beneficiaries related thereto) who experience a qualifying event at or after the
Closing,  including,  without limitation, any Transferred Employee terminated by
Buyer or any of its  Affiliates  (including  the  Company)  at or after  Closing
(regardless of whether such  Transferred  Employee or qualified  beneficiary has
been formally extended group health plan coverage by Buyer under a Buyer Benefit
Plan  at the  time  of the  qualifying  event).

         predecessor thereof), pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
         1.1502-6(a) (or any predecessor or successor thereof or any similar
         provision of Law), including without limitation any liability for Taxes
         resulting from an "intercompany transaction" in respect of which gain
         was deferred pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-13(a)(2)
         (or any predecessor or successor thereof or any analogous or similar
         provision of Law), that occurred on or before the Closing Date;
<PAGE>

               (B) any and all Taxes imposed on the Company (or any
         predecessor thereof), or for which the Company (or any predecessor
         thereof) may otherwise be liable (by reason of transferee liability,
         assumption, Contract, operation of Law or otherwise):

                           (1)      for any taxable year or period that ends on
                                    or before the Closing Date; and

                           (2)      subject to clause (C) of Section 6.3(a)(iv),
                                    for the Pre-Closing Period;

               (C) any and all Taxes resulting from, arising out of or based
         on the Section 338(h)(10) Elections made pursuant to this Agreement;
         provided, however, that Shareholder shall not be responsible for any
         Damages resulting from or arising out of (i) any late filing, failure
         to file or other defect of any kind with respect to any Section
         338(h)(10) Election or Section 338 Form, or (ii) any adverse
         determination of a Governmental Entity with respect to any portion of a

         other than to the extent such Damages result from or arise out of
         Shareholder's failure to comply with the provisions of Section 6.3(e)
         hereof;

               (D) any liability for sales, use or other similar Taxes

         collected by Buyer or the Company in respect of the Financing Contract
         pursuant to its reliance on an applicable exemption from such Taxes,
         and (2) such exemption from Taxes is dependent upon receipt of a
         properly executed Exemption Certificate;

               (F) any Claim by any party to a Financing Contract in respect
         of a sales, use or other similar Tax paid on or prior to the Closing
         Date where such Claim is based upon the provision of an Exemption
         Certificate; provided, however, that, if Shareholder is unable to
         obtain a refund of the entire amount of such Tax from the relevant
         Governmental Entity due to the invalidity of such Exemption Certificate
         (other than as a result of the expiration of the applicable statute of
         limitations), then any Buyer Indemnified Party who was paid any Damages
         pursuant to this Section 6.3(a)(i)(F) shall refund the amount of such
         Damages less the amount of refund obtained by Shareholder from the
         relevant Governmental Entity to Shareholder within fifteen (15) days of
         Shareholder's request therefor;
<PAGE>

               (G) any breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations
         contained in Section 3.8 of this Agreement, provided that for purposes
         of indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.3, any breach or
         inaccuracy of any representation shall be determined without regard to
         any qualification related to materiality;

               (H) any and all Taxes resulting from, arising out of or based on
         the transactions contemplated by Section 2.1(e) and Section 5.8(a) of
         this Agreement; and

               (I) any and all Taxes that relate to the Transferred Assets
         for periods (or portions thereof) up to and including the Closing Date,
         and any and all Taxes that relate to the Excluded Assets and Excluded
         Liabilities;

               (J) for a period that ends ninety (90) days after the issuance
         of a Revenue Agent Report to Buyer (whether agreed, unagreed, or
         excepted agreed) with respect to Buyer's first taxable year in which
         the Company (or any successor thereto) is includible as a member of
         Buyer's "affiliated group" within the meaning of Section 1504 of the
         Code, which does not include as an adjustment the treatment by the
         Company (or any successor thereto) of any Financing Contract as a true
         lease for federal income tax purposes (other than Company proposed
         adjustments or isolated IRS adjustments with respect to Financing
         Contracts that are not in compliance with the Company's true leasing
         guidelines, provided that the number of Financing Contracts with
         respect to which such IRS adjustments relate does not exceed
         eighty-five (85), in the case of Financing Contracts included in the
         Safeline portfolio, and eight (8), in the case of all other Financing
         Contracts, in the aggregate for such taxable year), any determination
         (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code) that a Financing Contract
         to which the Company is, as of the Closing Date, a party (or which is a
         Transferred Asset), and that has been treated by the Company as a true
         lease for federal income tax purposes, fails to qualify as a true lease
         for federal income tax purposes; provided, however, that, for purposes
         of this Section 6.3(a)(i)(J), the term "Damages" shall be limited to an
         amount (if any), calculated by Buyer, that would cause the Company's
         after Tax cash flows attributable to taxable periods beginning on or
         after the Closing Date, computed based on the regular federal and state
         Tax rate then in effect for such time period, to equal the after Tax
         cash flows attributable to taxable periods beginning after the Closing
         Date that would have been realized by the Company had such
         determination not occurred. Buyer shall prepare a statement setting
         forth the calculation of any Damages and submit it to Shareholder for
         Shareholder's review and comment. If, within thirty (30) days of
         Shareholder's receipt of such statement, Shareholder objects in writing
         to Buyer's calculation, Shareholder and Buyer shall engage the Selected
         Accounting Firm to resolve the dispute in accordance with the
         provisions of Section 6.8(b) hereof;

<PAGE>

                (ii) For purposes of Sections 6.3(a)(i)(E) and (J) hereof,(A) no
Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any indemnification pursuant
thereto unless and until the Company (or any successor thereto) has exhausted
any right to indemnification or reimbursement (or any similar right) for such
Taxes which gave rise to Shareholder's obligation to indemnify such Buyer
Indemnified Party pursuant to the terms of the Financing Contract to which such
Taxes relate from any other party thereto with respect to which the Company may
reasonably be expected to recover such Taxes, and (B) the term "Damages" shall
be reduced by any amount so indemnified, reimbursed or otherwise paid to the
Company (or any successor thereto).

                (iii) For purposes of Section 6.3(a)(i)(J), no Buyer
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any indemnification pursuant thereto with
respect to any Damages relating to, arising out of or resulting from (A) any
Financing Contract which is renewed, refinanced or the terms of which are
materially changed, altered or modified in any way by the Company (or any
successor thereto) at any time after the Closing; provided, however, that this
clause (A) shall only apply to the extent such Damages were incurred in, or
relate to, taxable periods (or portions thereof) beginning on or after the
occurrence of such renewal, refinancing, change, alteration or modification, (B)
any Financing Contract with respect to which the underlying assets are
transferred to any Person as part of a sale or sale/leaseback transaction after
the Closing; provided, however, that this clause (B) shall only apply to the
extent such Damages were incurred in, or relate to, taxable periods (or portions
thereof) beginning on or after the occurrence of such sale or sale/leaseback,
(C) any change in regulatory, statutory or administrative Tax Law; provided,
however, that for purposes of this clause (C), the term "administrative Tax Law"
only shall include administrative authorities that may be used or cited as
precedent within the meaning of Section 6110(k)(3) of the Code; provided,
further, that this clause (C) shall only apply to the extent such Damages were
incurred in, or relate to, taxable periods (or portions thereof) beginning on or
after the effective date of such change, (D) the filing of a disclosure
statement under Section 6662 of the Code (or any similar provision of Law) or
registration under Section 6111 of the Code (or any similar provision of Law)
with respect to any Financing Contract; provided, however, that in the event
Buyer determines that it may reasonably be required to file a disclosure
statement under Section 6662 of the Code to avoid penalties thereunder or may
reasonably be required to file a registration under Section 6111 of the Code,
and provided Buyer delivers written notice to Shareholder of such determination
forty-five (45) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such
filing, Buyer shall be permitted to file such disclosure statement or
registration and this clause (D) shall not apply, unless Shareholder provides to
Buyer no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date (including
extensions) of such filing a written opinion addressed to Buyer from tax counsel
reasonably acceptable to Buyer that failure to provide such statement should not
result in imposition of penalties under Section 6662 of the Code (or any similar
provision of Law) or that Buyer should not be required to register under Section
6111 of the Code (or any similar provision of Law), as the case may be, or (E)
any Financing Contract any interest in which has been transferred by the Company
(including, without limitation, pursuant to the merger, liquidation or other
transfer of all or substantially all of the Company's assets) to any Person
(other than the Buyer or Affiliates of Buyer); provided, however, that this
clause (E) shall only apply to the extent such Damages were incurred in, or
relate to, taxable periods (or portions thereof) beginning on or after the
occurrence of such transfer.

                (iv) Buyer shall be liable for, shall promptly defend and shall
indemnify and hold Shareholder Indemnified Parties harmless from and against,
any and all Damages resulting from, arising out of or based on (A) Taxes impose
on the Company for any taxable year or period that begins after the Closing
Date; (B)Taxes imposed on the Company for the Post-Closing Period; and (C) any
Taxes imposed on the Company not incurred in the ordinary course of business
attributable to acts of the Buyer after the Closing but on the Closing Date
(other than any such acts contemplated by this Agreement).
<PAGE>

                (v) To the extent permitted by Law or administrative practice,
the taxable year of the Company that includes the Closing Date shall be treated
as closing at the close of business on the Closing Date. Subject to clause (C)
of Section 6.3(a)(iv), for purposes of Sections 6.3(a)(i)(B)(2) and clause (B)
of Section 6.3(a)(iv), where it is necessary to apportion between Shareholder
and Buyer the Tax liability for a Straddle Period (which is not treated under
the immediately preceding sentence as closing at the close of business on the
Closing Date), such liability shall be apportioned between the period deemed to
end at the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Period") and
the period deemed to begin at the beginning of the day following the Closing
Date(the "Post-Closing Period") on the basis of an interim closing of the books;
provided, however, that property Taxes whose lien date is in the Pre-Closing
Period shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing Period and property Taxes whose
lien date is in the Post-Closing Period shall be allocated to the Post-Closing
Period.

                (vi) The Tax Sharing Agreement shall be terminated as of the
Reference Date as to the Company and Shareholder. All amounts due as of the
Reference Date from or to the Company under the Tax Sharing Agreement shall be
finally determined by Shareholder and paid by or to the Company, as the case may
be, on or prior to the Closing Date and shall be reflected in the Reference Date
Balance Sheet, and no additional amounts shall be due from or due to the Company
thereafter. Shareholder shall assume, shall promptly defend and shall indemnify
and hold Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any and all Damages
resulting from, arising out of or based on any liability under the Tax Sharing
Agreement to the extent that such liability has not been or will not be included
in the determination of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.1 of this
Agreement.

                (vii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Shareholder shall be responsible for the payment of all Transfer Taxes resulting
from, arising out of, based on or relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including any such Taxes resulting from, arising out of or based
on the Section 338(h)(10) Elections or the transactions contemplated by Section
2.1(e) and Section 5.8(a)). Shareholder shall be liable for, shall promptly
defend and shall indemnify and hold Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from and
against, any and all Damages resulting from, arising out of or based on any
failure by Shareholder to timely pay any and all such Transfer Taxes.

                (viii) Any refund of Taxes that is  received by the  Company,
Buyer or any Buyer Affiliate, and any amount credited against Tax to which the
Company, Buyer or any Buyer  Affiliate  become  entitled,  to the  extent  such
Taxes or amount credited  relate to any tax period that ends on or before the
Closing Date or to the  Pre-Closing  Period,  and to the  extent  that  such
Taxes or such  amount
<PAGE>

credited  have not been  reflected in the reserve or reserves for Tax  liability
set forth on the face of the final  audited  Reference  Date Balance  Sheet (but
excluding  any  reserve  for  deferred  Taxes   established  to  reflect  timing
differences  between  book  and  Tax  income),  shall  be  for  the  account  of
Shareholder,  and the Company,  Buyer or Buyer's Affiliate,  as the case may be,
shall pay over to  Shareholder  any such refund or amount  credited  (net of any
Taxes,  costs or expenses with respect  thereto)  within fifteen (15) days after
the Company's,  Buyer's or Buyer's  Affiliate's  receipt  thereof or entitlement
thereto. In the event there is a final determination that the Company,  Buyer or
such  Buyer  Affiliate  was  not  entitled  to any  such  amounts  paid  over to
Shareholder,  Shareholder  shall  return such amounts  within  fifteen (15) days
after the Company's, Buyer's or such Buyer Affiliate's request therefor.

     (b) Tax Returns.

                (i)  Shareholder  shall, in accordance with the Company's
past practice (except as otherwise required by applicable Law), prepare or cause
to be  prepared  and file or cause to be filed  when due all Tax  Returns  of or
including  the Company for all  periods  ending on or prior to the Closing  Date
that are filed after the Closing Date, and Shareholder  shall remit (or cause to
be remitted) all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns.  Shareholder  shall
permit  Buyer to review  and  comment  on each such Tax  Return  (to the  extent
related to the  Company)  no later than  thirty (30) days prior to the filing of
such Tax Return.  The Company shall provide  Shareholder  with the Company's Tax
information  for each Tax  Return no later  than  thirty  (30) days prior to the
original due date for such Tax Return. Shareholder shall not file any Tax Return
relating solely to Taxes of the Company  without Buyer's prior written  consent,
which  consent  shall  not  be  unreasonably  withheld.

                (ii)  Buyer  shall,  in accordance  with the Company's  past
practice (except as otherwise  required by applicable Law),  prepare or cause to
be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns of the Company for the
Straddle  Periods and Buyer shall remit (or cause to be remitted)  any Taxes due
with respect to such Tax Returns.  Buyer shall permit  Shareholder to review and
comment on each Tax Return with respect to which  Shareholder's  liability under
Section  6.3(a)(i)(B)(2)  hereof exceeds ($5,000) no later than thirty (30) days
prior to the filing date of such Tax  Return.  Buyer shall not file any such Tax
Return without  Shareholder's prior written consent,  which consent shall not be
unreasonably  withheld.  Not later  than five (5) days  before  the due date for
payment of Taxes with respect to any such Tax Returns,  Shareholder shall pay to
Buyer an amount  equal to the amount of Tax shown to be due on such Tax  Returns
which are  properly  allocated  to  Shareholder  under  Sections  6.3(a)(i)  and
6.3(a)(iii).  In the  event  that  (A)  Shareholder  fails  to  comply  with the
preceding  sentence and (B) Buyer pays or causes to be paid the Tax allocable to
Shareholder shown on any such Tax Return described therein,  the parties to this
Agreement  expressly  agree  that  Shareholder  shall be  required  to pay Buyer
interest  at the  applicable  statutory  rate for  underpayment  of Taxes,  with
respect to the amount of such Tax from the date the payment  was  required to be
made pursuant to the preceding sentence until the date Shareholder actually pays
such Tax to Buyer.
<PAGE>

     (c)  Assistance and  Cooperation.

                (i) Buyer,  the Company and  Shareholder shall cooperate  fully,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 6.3 and any audit, litigation
or other  proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Company (or Shareholder or any
of its  Affiliates  with  respect  to the  Transferred  Assets)  and shall  make
available to one another and to any Governmental Entity, as reasonably requested
in  connection  with any Tax  Return  described  in  Section  6.3(b)  or any Tax
Proceeding described in Section 6.3(d), all information relating to any Taxes or
Tax Returns of the Company (or Shareholder or any of its Affiliates with respect
to the  Transferred  Assets).  Such  cooperation  shall  also  include,  without
limitation,  the retention and (upon the other party's  reasonable  request) the
provision of records and  information  that are reasonably  relevant to any such
Tax Return, audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any materials  provided  hereunder.  The Company and Shareholder agree to (A)
retain all Books and  Records  with  respect  to Tax  matters  pertinent  to the
Company  relating to any taxable period  beginning before the Closing Date until
the  expiration of the statute of  limitations  (and, to the extent  notified by
Buyer or Shareholder, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods,
and abide by all  record  retention  agreements  entered  into  with any  Taxing
authority,  and (B) give the other  party  reasonable  written  notice  prior to
transferring,  destroying or discarding any such Books and Records,  and, if the
other party so requests,  the Company or Shareholder,  as the case may be, shall
allow the other party to take possession of such Books and Records.

                (ii)  Buyer and Shareholder further agree, upon request, to use
reasonable  efforts  to  obtain  any  certificate  or  other  document  from any
governmental body or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate  any  Tax  that  could  be  imposed;   provided  that  obtaining  such
certificate or other document may not reasonably be expected to adversely affect
Shareholder,  the  Company,  Buyer or any  Buyer  Affiliate.

     (d) Tax  Contests.

                (i) With respect to periods  ending on or
prior to the Closing Date,  Shareholder  shall have the exclusive  authority and
obligation to (A) represent the Company  before any  Governmental  Entity or any
court in any audit,  contest,  Claim,  proceeding  or inquiry  regarding the Tax
consequences of the operations of the Company or which relate to the Transferred
Assets (a "Tax Proceeding"),  and (B) settle or contest, in its sole discretion,
any such Tax Proceeding;  provided,  however, that Shareholder shall allow Buyer
and its counsel to participate  in, but not control,  any such Tax Proceeding at
Buyer's sole expense; provided, further, that Shareholder shall keep Buyer fully
and timely informed with respect to the  commencement,  status and nature of any
Tax  Proceedings  involving  any Tax  liability  of the Company for such taxable
periods;  provided,  further,  that if the  results  of any such Tax  Proceeding
involve  an issue  that  recurs in any  taxable  period of Buyer or the  Company
ending  after the  Closing  Date or  otherwise  may  reasonably  be  expected to
materially and adversely affect Buyer,  the Company,  or any of their respective
Affiliates  for any taxable  period  including or ending after the Closing Date,
then there  shall be no  settlement,  closing or other  agreement  with  respect
thereto without the consent of such affected  party,  which consent shall not be
unreasonably  withheld.
<PAGE>

                (ii) With respect to Straddle Periods (and,  subject to
Section 6.3(d)(iv) hereof, periods beginning after the Closing Date with respect
to which  Shareholder may reasonably be expected to be required to indemnify any
Buyer  Indemnified  Party  pursuant to Sections  6.3(a)(i)(D),  (E),  (F) or (J)
hereof),  Buyer  shall  have  the  exclusive  authority  and  obligation  to (A)
represent the Company in any Tax  Proceeding  and (B) settle or contest,  in its
sole discretion,  any such Tax Proceeding;  provided,  however, that Buyer shall
allow  Shareholder and its counsel to participate in, but not control,  such Tax
Proceeding  with  respect  to which the audit  adjustment,  in the case of a Tax
Proceeding  with respect to which  Shareholder  may reasonably be expected to be
required  to  indemnify  any  Buyer   Indemnified   Party  pursuant  to  Section
6.3(a)(i)(J) equals or exceeds $1,000,000, or the tax adjustment, in the case of
a Tax Proceeding with respect to which Shareholder may reasonably be expected to
be  required  to  indemnify  any Buyer  Indemnified  Party  pursuant to Sections
6.3(a)(i)(D),  (E) or (F)  equals or  exceeds  $25,000,  at  Shareholder's  sole
expense;  provided,  further, that Buyer shall keep Shareholder fully and timely
informed  with  respect to the  commencement,  status and nature of any such Tax
Proceeding;  provided,  further,  that there shall be no settlement,  closing or
other  agreement with respect to such Tax  Proceeding  with respect to which the
audit  adjustment,  in the  case  of a Tax  Proceeding  with  respect  to  which
Shareholder  may  reasonably  be expected to be required to indemnify  any Buyer
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 6.3(a)(i)(J) equals or exceeds $1,000,000,
or the tax  adjustment,  in the case of a Tax  Proceeding  with respect to which
Shareholder  may  reasonably  be expected to be required to indemnify  any Buyer
Indemnified  Party  pursuant  to  Sections  6.3(a)(i)(D),  (E) or (F)  equals or
exceeds $10,000, without the consent of Shareholder,  which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld;  provided,  further, that, in no event, shall Shareholder
be  permitted  access to Tax  information  of the  Company  relating  to periods
beginning  after the  Closing  Date  (other  than  with  respect  to an  audited
Financing  Contract) or any Tax  information of Buyer or any of its  Affiliates.

                (iii)  Except as  provided  in  Section  6.3(d)(ii),  with
respect to periods  beginning  after the  Closing  Date and Taxes  described  in
clause (C) of Section  6.3(a)(iv),  Buyer shall have the exclusive authority and
obligation to (A) represent the Company in any Tax  Proceeding and (B) settle or
contest,  in its sole discretion,  any such Tax Proceeding;  provided,  however,
that,  with  respect  to any such Tax  Proceeding  regarding  any Tax for  which
Shareholder  may  reasonably  be expected to be required to indemnify  any Buyer
Indemnified  Party (an "Indemnified  Proceeding"),  Buyer shall keep Shareholder
fully and timely informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of
any such  Indemnified  Proceeding;  provided,  further,  that there  shall be no
settlement,  closing  or  other  agreement  with  respect  to  such  Indemnified
Proceeding  without  the  consent of  Shareholder,  which  consent  shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
<PAGE>

                (iv) If a notice of a Tax  Proceeding  shall be  delivered,
sent,  commenced or initiated,  in writing,  to or against any party, any of its
Affiliates,  or the Company (a "Notified Party") by any Governmental Entity with
respect to Taxes for which the other  party may  reasonably  be  expected  to be
liable pursuant to Section 6.3(a), the Notified Party shall, if informed thereof
promptly,  notify the other party in writing of such Tax  Proceeding;  provided,
however,  that the failure of a party to give the other party  prompt  notice as
provided herein shall not relieve such other party of its obligations under this
Section  6.3  except  to the  extent  that  such  other  party is  actually  and
materially prejudiced thereby.

     (e) Section 338(h)(10) Elections. At Buyer's option, Shareholder shall join
with Buyer to take all  actions  necessary  and  appropriate  (including  timely
filing such forms, Tax Returns, elections,  schedules and other documents as may
be required),  at each party's cost and expense, to effect and preserve a timely
election  under  Section   338(h)(10)  of  the  Code  in  accordance   with  the
requirements of Section 338 of the Code and any elections under corresponding or
similar  provisions  of Law as  specified by Buyer in writing at or prior to the
Closing  or  pursuant  to the notice  provisions  of Section  11.3  hereof  (the
"Section  338(h)(10)  Elections")  with  respect to the purchase and sale of the
Shares  hereunder.  In the event  Buyer  elects to make any  Section  338(h)(10)
Election:

                (i) Shareholder,  the Company and Buyer shall report the
transactions   contemplated   herein  consistent  with  the  Section  338(h)(10)
Elections and shall take no position in any Tax Return,  any discussion  with or
proceeding  before any  taxing  authority,  or  otherwise,  or take any  action,
contrary  thereto  unless  and to the extent  required  to do so  pursuant  to a
determination  (as  defined  in  Section  1313(a)  of the  Code  or any  similar
provision of Law).

                (ii) The Company and Buyer shall execute at the Closing any and
all forms necessary to effectuate the Section 338(h)(10)  Elections  (including,
without  limitation,  IRS Form 8023 and any similar forms under  applicable  Tax
Laws, along with, in each case, all required statements or schedules thereto and
any amendments thereof (the "Section 338 Forms")).  Shareholder, the Company and
Buyer  shall  each  cause  the  Section  338  Forms  to be duly  executed  by an
authorized person for Shareholder, the Company and Buyer in each case, and shall
duly and timely file the Section 338 Forms in  accordance  with  applicable  Tax
Laws and the terms of this  Agreement.  Shareholder  and Buyer  shall  cooperate
fully with each other and make  available  to each other such Tax data and other
information as may be reasonably  required by Shareholder  and Buyer in order to
timely file any Section 338(h)(10) Election and any other required statements or
schedules.

                (iii) Shareholder and Buyer  agree  to use  their  best  efforts
to enter into an agreement (the  "Allocation  Agreement") as soon as practicable
after the Closing  Date to address the  computation  of the  modified  aggregate
deemed sale price (as defined under applicable Treasury  Regulations)  ("MADSP")
of the assets of the Company.  Buyer shall initially prepare a statement setting
forth a proposed  computation  and allocation of MADSP (the  "Computation")  and
submit it to Shareholder no later than forty-five (45) days after the completion
of the Adjusted  Reference  Date Balance  Sheet.  If, within thirty (30) days of
Shareholder's receipt of the Computation, Shareholder shall not have objected in
writing  to  the  Computation,  the  Computation  shall  become  the  Allocation
Agreement  and Buyer,  Shareholder  and the  Company  shall file the Section 338
Forms in a manner  consistent  with such  Allocation  Agreement  and Buyer,  the
Company and Shareholder shall file all Tax Returns consistent therewith.  If any
aspects of the Allocation Agreement are in dispute as of the date which is sixty
(60) days  prior to the date any of the  Section  338 Forms are  required  to be
filed,  Shareholder and Buyer shall then engage the Selected  Accounting Firm in
accordance  with the  provisions  of Section  6.8(b)  hereof.  To the extent the
Selected Accounting Firm has not resolved such dispute within (30) days prior to
<PAGE>

the date such Section 338 Forms are required to be filed, Buyer, Shareholder and
the Company shall file such Section 338 Forms, and all Tax Returns,  in a manner
consistent  with the  Computation  (together with any changes  thereto  mutually
agreed to by Buyer and  Shareholder  at such time).  Thereafter,  the Allocation
Agreement shall be revised in accordance with the  determination of the Selected
Accounting Firm and Buyer,  the Company and Shareholder  shall promptly  execute
any amendments  subsequent to the filing of the Section 338(h)(10)  Elections to
the Section 338 Forms to reflect  such  determination  that are  permitted to be
filed under applicable Law; provided,  however, to the extent such amendments to
the Section 338 Forms are not permitted to be filed under  applicable Law, Buyer
shall pay to Shareholder and Shareholder shall pay to Buyer, as the case may be,
amounts necessary to place the parties in the same position they would have been
in had such amendments been permitted to be filed.  Buyer and Shareholder  shall
not take a position before any  Governmental  Entity or otherwise  (including in
any Tax Return)  inconsistent  with the Allocation  Agreement  unless and to the
extent  required  to do so pursuant  to a  determination  (as defined in Section
1313(a) of the Code or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law).

     (f) Tax  Carryovers.  The Company shall elect,  where  permitted by law, to
carry forward any Tax Attribute (as defined below) of the Company arising in any
taxable  period  that  begins on or after the  Closing  Date that,  absent  such
election,  would be  carried  back to a taxable  period  ending on or before the
Closing Date. If, despite the preceding sentence,  the Company carries back to a
taxable  period  ending on or before the Closing  Date any Tax  Attribute of the
Company  arising in a taxable  period  beginning  on or after the Closing  Date,
Buyer shall pay to Shareholder, or Shareholder shall retain, as the case may be,
the  amount of any Tax  benefit  resulting  from the use of such Tax  Attribute.
Buyer  and the  Company  further  agree  that,  unless  required  pursuant  to a
determination  (as  defined  in  Section  1313(a)  of the  Code  or any  similar
provision  of Law),  neither  Buyer nor the Company  shall claim any Tax benefit
resulting  from the use of any Tax Attribute of the Company which arises from or
relates  to a taxable  period  which  ends on or before the  Closing  Date.  If,
despite the preceding sentence, Buyer or the Company claims or receives any such
Tax benefit,  Buyer shall pay to Shareholder an amount equal to such Tax benefit
claimed or received by Buyer or the Company from the use of such Tax  Attribute.
For  purposes of this Section  6.3(f),  the term "Tax  Attribute"  means any net
operating  loss, net capital loss,  investment  tax credit,  foreign tax credit,
charitable  deduction or any other credit or tax attribute that could be carried

with the Tape Audit,  including  access  during normal  business  hours and upon
reasonable  notice to such  relevant  accounting,  financial and other Books and
Records of the Company  reasonably  requested by the Tape Auditors in connection

(x) pay all of the fees of the Tape  Auditors and all expenses  incurred by such
firm,  and (y) provide  any  indemnification  required  by the Tape  Auditors in
connection with the Tape Audit.

Engagement Letter, a final audit report detailing (i) all discrepancies  between
the Reference Date Portfolio Information and the Tape Audit with respect to each
Audited  Financing  Contract,  and (ii) a  valuation  of each such  discrepancy,
calculated in  accordance  with the terms of the Tape Audit  Engagement  Letter.
Buyer and  Shareholder  shall have thirty (30) days following the receipt of the
final audit report to review such report and use their  commercially  reasonable
efforts  to  resolve  any  disputes  with the Tape  Auditors  in respect of such
report.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  any  disputes in respect of the final
audit report that are not resolved as provided in the foregoing  sentence  where

resolved  as  follows:  (i) fifty  percent  (50%) of the  aggregate  of all such
disputed amounts shall be deemed to have been resolved in  Shareholder's  favor,
and (ii) fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate of all such disputed amounts shall
be deemed to have been  resolved  in Buyer's  favor.

     (d)  Buyer  and  Shareholder  shall  pay to the  other,  as  applicable,  a
settlement  payment in respect of the net amount of all valuation  discrepancies
with respect to each Audited Financing Contract (the "Tape Settlement  Amount").
Any payment of a Tape  Settlement  Amount  required to be paid  pursuant  hereto
shall be (i) made on the  Business  Day  following  the  thirty  (30) day review
period set forth above, and (ii) paid by wire transfer of immediately  available
funds to an account in the United States (designated in writing by the recipient
thereof at least three (3) Business Days prior to such payment date).

such  access may  reasonably  be required by Buyer in  connection  with  matters
relating to the  Company or the  operations  and conduct of the  business of the
Company  prior  to the  Closing  Date.

     (b) Without  limiting  Section 6.7(a),  Shareholder,  Buyer and the Company
shall provide the other parties with such  nonprivileged  information in respect
of the  Company or the  business of the Company as is  reasonably  necessary  to
enable such party to satisfy its reporting obligations to Governmental Entities.

     (c) If the Company  shall desire to dispose of any of its Books and Records
relating to the  Company's  business as conducted  prior to Closing prior to the
expiration  of such seven (7) year  period,  the  Company  shall,  prior to such
disposition,   give  Shareholder  a  reasonable  opportunity,  at  Shareholder's
expense,  to  segregate  and remove  such Books and Records as  Shareholder  may
select.

inaccuracies or other breaches in the case of Section  10.3(a)(i) or pursuant to
the Category A Indemnities in case of Section 10.3(a)(ii), exceeds the Threshold
Amount in the aggregate,  in which event the Buyer Indemnified  Parties shall be
entitled to indemnification only to the extent such Damages exceed the Threshold
Amount  in  the  aggregate.   The  aggregate   liability  of   Shareholder   for
indemnification for the matters described in Sections 10.3(a)(i) and 10.3(a)(ii)
shall not exceed the Aggregate Amount.

     (b) The Buyer  Indemnified  Parties  shall not be entitled to recover  from
Shareholder  any  indemnification  for any  inaccuracy  or other  breach  of any
representation  or warranty in Section 3.17 unless and until the total amount of
all Damages in respect of such  inaccuracies or other breaches  exceeds $100,000
in the aggregate, in which event the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to  indemnification  only to the extent  such  Damages  exceed  $100,000  in the
aggregate.

     (c) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to recover from  Shareholder any Damages  suffered
or incurred by them  resulting  from,  arising out of or in connection  with any
attempt by Buyer or the Company to collect,  realize upon or  otherwise  recover
any  amounts  owed in  respect  of,  or any  action by Buyer or the  Company  to
enforce, any Inactive Financing Contract (other than any attempt by Buyer or the
Company to collect,  realize  upon or  otherwise  recover  any  amounts  owed in
respect  of, or any other  action  taken by Buyer or the  Company  to enforce an
Inactive Financing Contract that is brought or asserted as a defense, set off or
counterclaim to any action or Claim raised or asserted by any other Person).

     (d) In  calculating  any  amounts  payable by any  Indemnitor  pursuant  to
Section 10.2 in respect of any Damages incurred by any Indemnified  Party,  such
Indemnitor  shall  receive  credit  for (and the  amount of  Damages  subject to
indemnification  pursuant  to Section  10.2 shall be reduced  by) any  insurance
proceeds  actually received by any Indemnified Party in respect thereof (and, if
any such insurance proceeds are received after payment by the indemnifying party
of such  indemnification,  the  indemnified  party  shall  remit such  insurance
proceeds to the indemnifying party up to the amount of such indemnification paid
by the Indemnitor).

     (e) Each  Buyer  Indemnified  Party  entitled  to  indemnification  for any

based  on or  relating  to  any  inaccuracy  or  other  breach  of  any  Special
Representation  (except as specifically  set forth in Section  10.3(a)(ii)),  or
(ii)  pursuant  to  the  Category  B  Indemnities  shall  be  entitled  to  such
indemnification  for the full amount of such Damages regardless of the amount of
the Damages.
<PAGE>

     (f) Each Shareholder  Indemnified Party entitled to indemnification for any
Damages  pursuant to Section  10.2(b) shall be entitled to such  indemnification
for the full amount of such  Damages  regardless  of the amount of the  Damages.

     10.4  Procedure for  Indemnification

     (a) Claim  Notice.  Promptly  after the  occurrence  of any event,  action,
proceeding or Claim for which an Indemnified Party has a right to be indemnified
pursuant  to this  Agreement,  such  Indemnified  Party  may  assert a Claim for
indemnification   by  giving  written   notice  (the  "Claim   Notice")  to  the
indemnifying  party,  which will  describe in reasonable  detail,  to the extent
known to such  Indemnified  Party,  the  facts  and  circumstances  on which the
asserted  Claim for  indemnification  is based.  The  failure to give  notice as
required  by this  Section  10.4(a)  in a timely  fashion  shall not result in a
waiver of any right to  indemnification  hereunder except to the extent that the
indemnifying  party's  ability to defend against the event with respect to which
indemnification is sought is materially and adversely affected by the failure of
the  Indemnified  Party to give  notice in a timely  fashion as required by this
Section 10.4(a).  Unless the Claim described in the Claim Notice is contested by
the indemnifying  party by written notice to the Indemnified Party of the amount
of the Claim that is contested,  given within thirty (30) days of the receipt of
the Claim  Notice,  the  Indemnified  Party shall be  entitled  to recover  such
undisputed  amount  of the Claim  described  in the Claim  Notice.

     (b)  Dispute  Notice.  If,  within  thirty  (30) days of the receipt by the
indemnifying  party of the Claim  Notice,  the  indemnifying  party  contests in
writing to the  Indemnified  Party that such loss  constitutes an  indemnifiable
Claim (the "Dispute  Notice"),  then the Indemnified  Party and the indemnifying
party,  acting in good faith,  shall attempt to reach  agreement with respect to
such Claim and,  failing such agreement,  the  Indemnified  Party shall have the
right to pursue any  remedies  at Law or equity  that may be  available  to such
Person.

     (c) Third Party  Claims.

                (i)  Subject to 10.4(d),  the indemnifying  party shall be
entitled  (but not  obligated)  to assume the defense or settlement of any third
party Claim,  or to participate in any  negotiations or proceedings to settle or
otherwise  eliminate any such Claim, if it shall provide the Indemnified Parties
a written  acknowledgement  of its liability for the indemnity  against  Damages
relating to such Claim.

                (ii) Notwithstanding  anything in Section  10.4(d) to the
contrary,  if a third party Claim relates to both the pre-Closing period and the
post-Closing period, is asserted against both Shareholder,  on the one hand, and
Buyer and/or the Company, on the other hand, and both Shareholder and Buyer have
the right to assume the defense of such Claim,  Shareholder and Buyer shall work
together in good faith to arrange joint representation  reasonably acceptable to
both parties.
<PAGE>

                (iii) To the extent an indemnifying  party  assumes the defense
or  settlement  of a third party  Claim,  such  indemnifying  party shall select
counsel reasonably  acceptable to the Indemnified Party in connection therewith,
and such indemnifying party shall conduct the defense diligently,  in good faith
and in consultation  with the Indemnified  Party, and shall keep the Indemnified
Party timely  apprised of the status of such third party Claim.  No indemnifying
party shall be entitled to settle or  compromise  any third party Claim  without
the consent or agreement of the applicable Indemnified Party (which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that consent by the
Indemnified  Party  shall  be  deemed  to be  reasonably  withheld  if,  in  the
Indemnified Party's judgment, the proposed settlement would adversely impact the
business of the Indemnified  Party or any of its Affiliates or if the settlement
requires the  Indemnified  Party or any of its Affiliates to admit  liability or
wrongdoing; provided, further, that if an offer of compromise is received by the
indemnifying  party  with  respect  to any  indemnified  Claim and such offer to
compromise (A) includes an unconditional  release of the Indemnified  Party, and
(B)  involves  only the  payment  of money  (which  the  indemnifying  party has
unconditionally  agreed with the Indemnified Party, in writing,  to pay, subject
only to receipt of the  Indemnified  Party's  consent) (a "Qualified  Settlement
Offer"),  the indemnifying  party may notify the Indemnified Party in writing of
such indemnifying  party's willingness to compromise or settle such Claim on the
basis set  forth in such  Qualified  Settlement  Offer and if (but only if) such
Indemnified  Party fails to timely consent to such Qualified  Settlement  Offer,
the  indemnifying  party's  liability  shall be limited to the lesser of (1) the
settlement  amount  set forth in such  Qualified  Settlement  Offer,  or (2) the
actual  out-of-pocket  amount such Indemnified Party is ultimately  obligated to
pay as a result of such indemnified  Claim,  and the Indemnified  Party shall be
responsible  for the  costs  and  attorneys'  fees  in  respect  of  such  Claim
thereafter.

                (iv) In the event that an indemnifying  party fails to elect to
assume the defense of a third party Claim within ten (10)  Business  Days of the
receipt of a Claim Notice,  the Indemnified Party may assume the defense of such
third party Claim.  To the extent an  Indemnified  Party  assumes the defense or
settlement of a third party Claim,  such Indemnified  Party shall select counsel
reasonably  acceptable to the indemnifying  party in connection  therewith,  and
such Indemnified Party shall conduct the defense  diligently,  in good faith and
in consultation  with the  indemnifying  party,  and shall keep the indemnifying
party timely  apprised of the status of such third party Claim.  No  Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to settle or  compromise  any third party Claim  without
the consent or agreement of the  applicable  indemnifying  party (which  consent
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed);  provided,  however, that consent
by the indemnifying  party shall be deemed to be reasonably  withheld if, in the
indemnifying  party's judgment,  the proposed  settlement would adversely impact
the  business  of the  indemnifying  party  or any of its  Affiliates  or if the
settlement  requires the  indemnifying  party or any of its  Affiliates to admit
liability or wrongdoing.
<PAGE>

     (d) Non-Assumable Claims.

                (i) Notwithstanding anything in this  Agreement to the
contrary,  Buyer  and the  Company  shall  have the  sole  right,  with  counsel
reasonably   acceptable  to   Shareholder,   to  defend  any  Claim  that  is  a
Non-Assumable  Claim and Shareholder shall not be entitled to assume the defense
thereof. Buyer and the Company shall conduct the defense of Non-Assumable Claims
diligently and in good faith, and shall keep Shareholder  timely apprised of the
status of all Non-Assumable  Claims. Buyer and the Company shall not be entitled
to settle or  compromise  any  Non-Assumable  Claim  for which  Shareholder  has
acknowledged  sole  liability to Buyer without the prior consent or agreement of
Shareholder (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  Buyer
shall consult with Shareholder  prior to proffering any offer of compromise to a
third party claimant in respect of a Non-Assumable  Claim for which  Shareholder
has acknowledged sole liability to Buyer.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event (x) Buyer and the Company proffer any offer of compromise to a third party
claimant  in  respect  of  a  Non-Assumable  Claim  for  which  Shareholder  has
acknowledged  sole  liability to Buyer and  Shareholder  has not  approved  such
offer, or (y) Buyer and the Company settle or compromise a  Non-Assumable  Claim
for which  Shareholder has acknowledged  sole liability to Buyer and Shareholder
has not approved such settlement or compromise,  Shareholder shall not be bound,
in each case, by any prior  acknowledgement  of liability to Buyer in respect of
such Non-Assumable Claim or the amount of the resultant Damages.

                (ii) Upon the receipt by Buyer or the Company of an offer of
compromise  relating to a  Non-Assumable  Claim that  includes an  unconditional
release of Buyer or the Company and  requires  only (A) the payment of money for
which Shareholder has sole liability (a "Monetary Settlement") or (B) a Monetary
Settlement and (1) any action by  Shareholder  or any of its  Affiliates  (other
than the  Company)  or (2) any action by Buyer or the Company  that,  in Buyer's
judgment,  does not adversely impact the ongoing business of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates  (including  the  Company)  and does not  require  any  admission  of
liability or wrongdoing on the part of Buyer or its  Affiliates  (including  the
Company)  (collectively,  a "Non-Assumable  Claim Offer"),  Buyer shall promptly
inform Shareholder of such Non-Assumable Claim Offer together with a description
of the material terms thereof. Shareholder shall have the right to terminate its
liability for Damages in respect of any Non-Assumable Claim that is subject to a
Non-Assumable  Claim Offer upon Shareholder's  irrevocable  agreement to pay the
amount  contained  in such  Non-Assumable  Claim  Offer  and to take any  action
required to be taken by  Shareholder  or any of its  Affiliates  by the terms of
such  Non-Assumable  Claim  Offer.  Upon  receipt  by  Buyer  of (x) the  amount
contained in such  Non-Assumable  Claim Offer and payment by  Shareholder of all
other Damages  suffered or incurred by any Indemnified  Party in respect of such
Non-Assumable  Claim,  and (y) an  executed  agreement  of  Shareholder  and the
third-party  claimant agreeing to the non-cash terms of such Non-Assumable Claim
Offer,  if any,  Shareholder  shall  have no further  liability  to Buyer or the
Company in respect of such  Non-Assumable  Claim.

                (iii) At any time  during the defense by Buyer and the Company
of a Non-Assumable Claim,  Shareholder shall have the right to require Buyer and
the Company (A) to proffer to any third party claimant under such  Non-Assumable
Claim a Non-Assumable  Claim Offer, and (B) if such Non-Assumable Claim Offer is
accepted by a such third party claimant,  to settle such Non-Assumable  Claim on
the terms of such Non-Assumable Claim Offer.

     (e) Tax Treatment. Any payments under Sections 6.3(a), 6.6(c) or 10 of this
Agreement  shall be treated by the parties  hereto for federal,  state and local
income Tax purposes (whether foreign or domestic) as a non-taxable reimbursement
or purchase price adjustment,  except to the extent that a contrary treatment is
required by Law. If,  notwithstanding such treatment by the parties, any payment
made under Sections 6.3(a), 6.6(c) or 10 is required to be treated as taxable to
a Buyer  Indemnified  Party pursuant to a  determination  (as defined in Section
1313(a) of the Code or any similar provision of Law) of any Governmental Entity,
Shareholder  shall indemnify such Buyer  Indemnified Party for any Taxes payable
by reason of the receipt of such indemnity payment (including any payments under
this Section 10.4(e)).
<PAGE>

     (f) Access. The Person conducting the defense of any third party Claim, its
representatives  and agents  shall  have  access to the  premises  and Books and
Records of the Indemnified  Party or indemnifying  party (as applicable) and its
Affiliates to the extent reasonably necessary to assist in defending or settling
any action,  proceeding or Claim;  provided,  however, that such access shall be
conducted in such manner as not to interfere  unreasonably with the operation of
the  business  of such  Person  or its  Affiliates.  The  Indemnified  Party  or
indemnifying   party  (as   applicable)   shall  be  required  to  disclose  any
nonprivileged  information  with respect to itself or any of its  Affiliates (or
former  Affiliates)  as is  reasonably  necessary  to assist it in  defending or
settling such action, proceeding or Claim. The Indemnified Party or indemnifying
party (as  applicable)  shall (at the other  party's  expense)  be  required  to
participate  in the defense of any Claim to be indemnified  hereunder  solely to
the extent  otherwise  required  hereunder or as is reasonably  necessary in the
defense of any Claim to be  indemnified  hereunder.

     (g) Costs.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Section 10.4,
the   indemnifying   party  shall  continue  to  pay  the  attorneys'  fees  and
disbursements  and other costs each Indemnified  Party may incur (whether or not
the indemnifying party shall have assumed the defense of such indemnified Claim)
to the extent such  participation  relates to (i) a Claim or defense as to which
the  indemnifying  party may have a  conflict  of  interest,  or (ii)  discovery
against or testimony of such  Indemnified  Party and for  participation  of such
Indemnified  Party's own counsel in such  discovery  and  testimony.

     (h) Taxes.  Notwithstanding  anything in this Section 10.4 to the contrary,
in the event of a  discrepancy  between the  procedures set forth in this
Section 10.4 and Section 6.3 with respect to Taxes,  the  provisions  of Section
6.3 shall control.

     10.5 Exclusive Remedy

     Except  with  respect  to  Claims  based on  fraud  and/or  claims  seeking
equitable  remedies,  the  indemnification  remedies set forth in this Agreement
shall  constitute  the sole and  exclusive  remedies of the parties  hereto with
respect to any  breach of  representation,  warranty  or  obligation  under this
Agreement.

11. General

     11.1 Public Announcements

     Each party agrees not to make any press release or public  announcement  in
regard  to the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement  and  the  other
Transaction Documents without prior consultation with, and the prior consent of,
the other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
except  as may be  required  by Law or  under  any  listing  agreement  with any
securities  exchange or stock  exchange  regulations,  in which case the parties
shall use reasonable  efforts to coordinate  with each other with respect to the
timing, form and content of such required disclosures.

     11.2 Assignment

     Neither Shareholder nor Buyer may assign any of its rights or
obligations hereunder except by operation of Law without the prior written
consent of the other party; provided, however, that (a) Shareholder may assign
its rights and obligations hereunder to an Affiliate of Shareholder, and (b)
Buyer may assign its rights hereunder to an Affiliate of Buyer. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, however, no assignment otherwise permitted hereunder shall,
without the written consent of the non-assigning party, relieve the assigning
party from any of its obligations hereunder.

     This Agreement shall be governed by, construed under and enforced in
accordance with, and all disputes arising with respect to this Agreement shall

of conflict of Laws. The parties irrevocably consent to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in (a) King
County, Washington, and (b) New York City, New York, in connection with any

     The terms,  covenants and conditions of this  Agreement  shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding on the respective  successors and permitted assigns of
the parties.

     11.6 Severability

     If any  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  determines  that  any  part  or

<PAGE>

     11.7 Modification and Waiver

     This  Agreement may not be amended or modified or superseded and any of its
terms and conditions may not be waived in any manner, except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the parties hereto,  or in the case of a waiver, by or
on behalf of the party  waiving  such  compliance.  The  failure of any party to
enforce at any time any of the provisions of this  Agreement  shall in no way be
construed to be a waiver of any such  provision,  or in any way affect the right
of such party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision.  No waiver by
any  party  of  any  condition  or  of  any  breach  of  any  terms,  covenants,
representations,  warranties or agreements  contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be a further or continuing  waiver of any such  condition or breach in
other  instances  or a waiver of any other  condition or any breach of any other
terms,  covenants,  representations,   warranties  or  agreements.

     11.8 Entire Agreement

     This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding among the
parties  with  respect to the subject  matter  hereof and  supersedes  all prior
agreements  and  undertakings,  both  written and oral,  among the parties  with
respect to such subject matter.

     11.9 Counterparts

     This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,  which together
shall constitute one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one
or more  counterparts have been signed by each party hereto and delivered to the
other parties hereto.

     11.10 No Third Party Rights

         Nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall be construed, to
confer upon any Person other than the Company, Shareholder or Buyer (and only to
the extent expressly provided herein, their respective Affiliates) any right or
remedy under or by reason of this Agreement; provided, however, that the parties
hereto agree and acknowledge that the agreements and covenants contained in
Section 10 are, subject to Section 9, intended for the benefit of the
Indemnified Parties referred to therein (each such Person, a "Third Party
Beneficiary"), and that, subject to Section 9, each such Indemnified Party,
although not a party to this Agreement, shall be and is hereby constituted a
direct and irrevocable Third Party Beneficiary of the agreements and covenants
contained in Section 10 and shall have the right to enforce such agreements and
covenants against the applicable party thereto in all respects fully and to the
same extent as if such Third Party Beneficiary were a party hereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement (including but not limited to
Section 10) may be amended or waived by Buyer, Shareholder and the Company at
any time and from time to time in accordance with Section 11.7 hereof and any
such amendment or waiver shall be fully effective with respect to the rights of
the Third Party Beneficiaries under Section 10.

     The captions and headings  used in this  Agreement  have been  inserted for
convenience of reference only and shall not be considered part of this Agreement
or  be  used  in  the  interpretation  thereof.

     11.12 Waiver of Subrogation;  Contribution;  Reimbursement and Other Rights

     (a) Shareholder hereby acknowledges and agrees that it shall not raise as a
defense or bar, and hereby waives,  as to any Claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party
under this Agreement, that on or prior to the Closing, the Company had or should
have had knowledge of any fact, condition, event or circumstance that (i) caused
any  representation  or warranty  made by  Shareholder  and/or the Company to be
inaccurate  or  untrue  or (ii)  could  form the  basis of any  Claim by a Buyer
Indemnified  Party  against   Shareholder   pursuant  to  this  Agreement.

     (b) Shareholder  hereby agrees that if, following the Closing,  any payment
is required to be made by it pursuant to the terms of Section  6.6,  Section 6.8
or  otherwise  in respect of any  Damages  suffered  or  incurred by any Person,
Shareholder  shall  have no rights  against  the  Company,  whether by reason of
subrogation,  contribution,  reimbursement or otherwise,  in respect of any such
payments or liabilities,  and shall not take any action against the Company with
respect thereto.  Any such rights which  Shareholder may, by operation of Law or
otherwise, have against the Company shall, effective at the time of the Closing,
be deemed to be hereby expressly and knowingly  waived.  Nothing in this Section
11.12 shall,  however,  in any way limit any and all rights Shareholder may have
against Buyer.

     11.13 Waiver of Jury Trial

     EACH PARTY  HERETO  KNOWINGLY,  VOLUNTARILY  AND  INTENTIONALLY  WAIVES ANY
RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON,
OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER,  OR IN CONNECTION  WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY EXHIBIT,
ANNEX OR  SCHEDULE  HERETO,  OR ANY  COURSE OF  CONDUCT,  COURSE OF  DEALING  OR

IS A MATERIAL  INDUCEMENT FOR THE PARTIES  HERETO TO ENTER INTO THIS  AGREEMENT.
