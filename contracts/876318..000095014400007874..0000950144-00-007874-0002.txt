                  (a)      Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall promptly
notify the Purchaser in writing of all events, circumstances, facts and
occurrences arising subsequent to the date of this Agreement which could
reasonably be expected to result in any breach of a representation or warranty
or covenant of the Seller in this Agreement or which could reasonably be
expected to have the effect of making any representation or warranty of the
Seller in this Agreement untrue or incorrect at any time from the date hereof
through the Closing.

                  (b)      Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall promptly
notify the Seller in writing of all events, circumstances, facts and occurrences
arising subsequent to the date of this Agreement which could reasonably be
expected to result in any breach of a representation or warranty or covenant of
the Purchaser in this Agreement or which could reasonably be expected to have
the effect of making any representation or warranty of the Purchaser in this
Agreement untrue or incorrect at any time from the date hereof through the
Closing.

         SECTION 5.3       Registration Rights. The Shares and all securities
issued on account of or with respect to the Shares by reason of stock splits,
stock dividends, recapitalizations or otherwise shall be considered "Securities"
under that certain "Annex II - Registration Rights" that is an annex to the
Stock Purchase Agreement between InterCel, Inc. and Ericsson Inc. dated as of
March 4, 1996, pursuant to which the shares of the Seller's Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock that are currently held by the Purchaser were originally
purchased, and the Purchaser or any Person to whom the Purchaser transfers at
least 300,000 shares of the Common Stock or securities convertible into at least
300,000 shares of the Common Stock, as adjusted for stock splits, stock
dividends, combinations or similar transactions (a "Qualified Transferee") shall
be accorded all registration and other rights set forth in such Annex II with
respect to the Shares. In addition, in the event that the Purchaser transfers
its rights hereunder to an Affiliate of the Purchaser as set forth in Section
9.7, the Purchaser's registration and other rights set forth in such Annex II
with respect to the Shares will likewise be assigned to such Affiliate of the
Purchaser or any Qualified Transferee of such Affiliate.

         SECTION 5.4       Resale Restrictions. The Purchaser acknowledges that
the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state
securities law, and the Purchaser hereby agrees not (and not to enter into any
agreement) to effect any Sale of the Shares unless and until such transaction is
registered under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities law or
unless such transaction is exempt from registration under the Securities Act and
such laws; provided, that in the event the Purchaser desires to claim an
exemption from registration in connection with any such transaction, as a
condition to claiming such exemption, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller
a legal opinion issued by the Purchaser's legal counsel, which opinion and
counsel must be reasonably satisfactory to the Seller, establishing the
applicability of an exemption to such transaction. The certificate representing
the Shares shall bear a legend referencing the restrictions on transferability
set forth in this Agreement, and the Seller shall place stop transfer orders on
the books of its transfer agent with respect to the Shares.

         SECTION 5.5       Registration of Shares. The Seller shall, upon
issuance of the Shares and prior to the delivery of stock certificates
evidencing the Shares pursuant to Section 2.4, register the Shares in the name
of the Purchaser in the stock records of the Seller.

date of this Agreement and ending not earlier than two years from the Closing
Date, for so long as the Seller is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Seller shall file all reports and
other information required to be filed by Section 13 or 15(d) under the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, as shall be necessary in order that the conditions to
the availability of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be
amended, in connection with any Sale of shares of Common Stock by the Purchaser
shall be met.

         SECTION 5.7       Use of Funds. The Seller shall use the proceeds from
the sale of the Shares solely in connection with the DiGiPH Transaction.

         SECTION 5.8       Further Action. Each of the parties hereto shall use
all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do
or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Neither the period of survival nor the liability of the Seller with respect to
the Seller's representations and warranties shall be reduced by any
investigation made at any time by or on behalf of the Purchaser. If written

Seller to the Purchaser, then the relevant representations and warranties shall
survive as to such claim, until such claim has been finally resolved.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                             TERMINATION AND WAIVER

         SECTION 8.1       Termination. This Agreement may be terminated as
follows:

                  (a)      by the Purchaser if, between the date hereof and the
time scheduled for the Closing: (i) any representation or warranty of the Seller
contained in this Agreement shall not have been true and correct when made,
except where such failure does not cause a Material Adverse Effect; (ii) the
Seller shall not have complied in all material respects with any covenant or
agreement to be complied with by it and contained in this Agreement; or (iii)
the Seller or any Subsidiary makes a general assignment for the benefit of
creditors, or any proceeding shall be instituted by or against the Seller or any
Subsidiary seeking to adjudicate any of them a bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking
liquidation, winding up or reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, protection,
relief or composition of its debts under any Law relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization; or

                  (b)      by the Seller if, between the date hereof and the
time scheduled for the Closing: (i) any representation or warranty of the
Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall not have been true and correct when
made, except where such failure does not cause a Material Adverse Effect; (ii)
the Purchaser shall not have complied in all material respects with any covenant
or agreement to be complied with by it and contained in this Agreement; or (iii)
the Purchaser makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or any

<PAGE>   16

                  (c)      by either the Seller or the Purchaser if the Closing
shall not have occurred on or prior to March 31, 2001, which termination shall
be effective upon receipt of written notice thereof by the intended recipient as
set forth in Section 9.2 hereof; or

                  (d)      by either the Purchaser or the Seller in the event
that any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or
taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or
other action shall have become final and nonappealable, which termination shall
be effective upon receipt of written notice thereof by the intended recipient as
set forth in Section 9.2 hereof; or

                  (e)      immediately upon the mutual written consent of the
Seller and the Purchaser.

         SECTION 8.2       Right of Cure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Purchaser or the Seller ("Terminating Party") claim the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(b), then the Terminating
Party must provide the other party ("Recipient") with written notice of its
intention to terminate or abandon the Agreement, which notice shall identify the
condition or event giving rise to the Terminating Party's right to terminate or
abandon the Agreement. The Recipient will have ten (10) business days from
receipt of such notice to cure such condition or event; provided that in the
event that the Terminating Party provides such notice based on a representation
or warranty of the Recipient contained in this Agreement which was not true or
correct when made upon the execution of this Agreement, an action by the
Recipient within ten (10) days of such notice such that, if called upon to do
so, Recipient could make such representation or warranty in a truthful and
correct manner in all material respects will be deemed to constitute a cure of
such default. The provisions of this Section 8.2 shall not apply to termination
pursuant to Sections 8.1(c), 8.1 (d) or 8.1(e).

         SECTION 8.3       Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of
this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no liability on the part of either party hereto except
that nothing herein shall relieve either party from liability for any breach of
this Agreement occurring prior to termination.

         SECTION 8.4       Waiver. Either party to this Agreement may: (i)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other party; (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered by
the other party pursuant hereto; or (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions of the other party contained herein. Any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
the party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be
construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the
same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition, of this
Agreement. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall
not constitute a waiver of any of such rights.
