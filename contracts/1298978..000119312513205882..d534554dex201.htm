Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of

Common Stock:

 



-2-  (a) _Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, whereupon
each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of
Merger Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Company Capital Stock_.

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any Cancelled Company Shares and any
Dissenting Company Shares) shall be canceled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive the following
consideration: (A) $6.00 in cash, without interest (such per share cash
amount being referred to herein as the " _Cash Consideration_ ") _plus_ (B)
0.1553 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common
Stock (such per share amount of Parent Common Stock being referred to herein
as the " _Stock Consideration_ "), upon the surrender of the Certificate
representing such share of Company Common Stock (or the receipt of an agents
message in the case of Book-Entry Shares) in the manner set forth in _Section
1.9_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery
of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner set forth in _Section
1.9(h)_). For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the term " _Merger
Consideration_ " shall mean the Cash Consideration _plus_ the Stock
Consideration, together with any cash payable under _Section 1.7(b)(iii)_ in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable pursuant
hereto. From and after the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired
and cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate theretofore representing
any shares of Company Common Stock (other than any Cancelled Company Shares
and any Dissenting Company Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration issuable and
payable in respect thereof pursuant to this _Section 1.7(b)_ and any
dividends or other distributions issuable or payable in respect thereof
pursuant to _Section 1.9(c)_ upon the surrender thereof in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 1.9_. The Merger Consideration issued upon the
surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
the terms hereof (including any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 1.7(b)(iii)_ and _Section 1.9(c)_) shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of any shares of Company Common Stock
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article I_.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
(A) the Stock Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect fully
the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into shares of Parent
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other
like change with respect to Parent Common Stock having a record date on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, and (B) the Cash
Consideration and the Stock Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to
reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into shares of Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time (it being understood and agreed that the inclusion of this clause (B)
shall not be deemed to amend or modify in any respect the restrictions set
forth in _Article IV_ ).

(iii) No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue
of the Merger or pursuant to this Agreement, and in lieu thereof each holder
of record of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled
to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by
such holder of record) shall be entitled to receive from Parent,
upon surrender of such holders Certificate(s) in the manner set forth in
_Section 1.9_,

 



-3-   an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the Parent Common Stock
Closing Price.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of any shares of Company
Common Stock, each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent,
any Subsidiary of Parent or the Company (collectively, " _Cancelled Company
Shares_ "), in each case as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration
paid therefor.

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a shareholder who shall have neither voted in
favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have
properly and validly demanded its rights to be paid the fair value of such
Company Shares in accordance with Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA (" _Dissenting
Company Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to
receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to this  _Section 1.7_. By virtue
of the Merger, all Dissenting Company Shares shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist and the holders of such Dissenting Company Shares shall
thereafter be entitled only to such rights with respect to such Dissenting
Company Shares as are provided under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA; _provided,
however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, all Dissenting Company Shares
held by a shareholder who shall have failed to perfect or who shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost such shareholders right to dissent under
such Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender of the
Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company
Common Stock (or receipt of an agents message in the case of Book-Entry
Shares) in the manner set forth in  _Section 1.9_. The Company shall give
Parent (x) prompt notice of any notice received by the Company of any
shareholders intent to exercise its dissenters rights under Section 23B.13
of the WBCA, demand received by the Company for payment of the fair value of
any Company Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
received by the Company which relate to any such demand for dissenters rights
and (y) the opportunity to direct and control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for dissenters rights under Washington
Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to any demands for dissenters rights or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

(vi) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
that the sum of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable in the Merger plus (B) the maximum number of shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise of all Assumed Options, Assumed RSUs and
Assumed Stock Appreciation Rights after giving effect to the cash-out of
vested Company Options and vested Company Stock Appreciation Rights pursuant
to Section 1.8(g) (the sum of the amounts in clauses (A) and (B), the " _Total
Stock Amount_ ") would be equal to or greater than nineteen and nine tenths
percent (19.9%) of the shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amount, the " _Stock Threshold_
"), the Stock Consideration in the Merger shall be decreased to the minimum
extent necessary, such that the Total Stock Amount shall not equal or exceed
the Stock Threshold. In such event, the Cash Consideration in the Merger shall
be increased by an amount equal to the product of (A) the amount of such
reduction in the Stock Consideration in the Merger pursuant to the preceding
sentence multiplied by (B) Parent Common Stock Closing Price.

1.8 _Treatment of Company Stock Awards_. 

(a) _Company Options Held by Continuing Service Providers_. At the Effective
Time, each Company Option (or portion thereof) that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a Continuing
Service Provider shall, without any further action on the part of any holder
of Company Options, be assumed by Parent (each, an " _Assumed Option_ "),
unless Parent provides written notice to the Company

 



-4-   that certain Company Options shall not be assumed in accordance with
_Section 1.8(g)_. Each such Assumed Option shall be subject to the same terms
and conditions as applied to the related Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time, including the vesting schedule applicable thereto, except
that (A) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed
Option shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying such Assumed Option as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio (with the resulting
number, in the event a fractional share results, rounded down to the nearest
whole share), and (B) the per share exercise price of each Assumed Option
shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing (x) the exercise price
per share at which such Assumed Option was exercisable immediately prior to
the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio (with the resulting price per
share rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Continuous employment with the
Company prior to the Effective Time will be credited to holders of Assumed
Options for purposes of any vesting requirements applicable to the Assumed
Options after the Effective Time. The assumption of Assumed Options classified
as "incentive stock options" (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code)
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be effected in a manner that
satisfies the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, the assumption of all other Assumed
Options shall be effected in a manner that satisfies the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder,
and this _Section 1.8_ will be construed consistent with such intentions.

 

(b) _Company Restricted Stock Units Held by Continuing Service Providers_. At
the Effective Time, each award of Company Restricted Stock Units (or portion
thereof) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that is held by a Continuing Service Provider shall, without any further
action on the part of any holder of Company Restricted Stock Units,
be assumed by Parent (each, an " _Assumed RSU_ "). Each such Assumed RSU
shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the related
Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including the vesting schedule applicable thereto, except that the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed RSU shall be equal to
the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying
such Assumed RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
(y) the Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number, in the event a fractional
share results, rounded down to the nearest whole share). Continuous employment
with the Company prior to the Effective Time will be credited to holders of
Assumed RSUs for purposes of any vesting requirements applicable to the
Assumed RSUs after the Effective Time.

(c) _Company Stock Appreciation Rights Held by Continuing Service Providers_.
At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Appreciation Right (or portion
thereof) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
and that is held by a Continuing Service Provider shall, without any further
action on the part of any holder of Company Stock Appreciation Rights, be
assumed by Parent (each, an " _Assumed Stock Appreciation Right_ "), unless
Parent provides written notice to the Company that certain Company Stock
Appreciation Rights shall not be assumed in accordance with _Section 1.8(g)_.
Each such Assumed Stock Appreciation Right shall be subject to the same terms
and conditions as applied to the related Company Stock Appreciation Right
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the vesting schedule
applicable thereto, except that (A) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to each Assumed Stock Appreciation Right shall be equal to the
product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such
Assumed Stock Appreciation Right as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number, in the event
a fractional share results, rounded down to the nearest whole share), and (B)
the per share exercise price of each Assumed Stock Appreciation Right shall be
equal to the quotient determined by dividing (x) the exercise price per share
at which such Assumed Stock Appreciation Right was exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio (with the resulting
price per share rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Continuous employment
with the Company prior to the Effective Time will be credited to holders of
Assumed Stock Appreciation Rights for purposes of any vesting requirements
applicable to the Assumed Stock Appreciation Rights after the Effective Time.
The assumption of Assumed Stock Appreciation Rights pursuant to this Section
shall be effected in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Section 409A
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and this
_Section 1.8_ will be construed consistent with this intent.

 



-5-  (d) _Company Stock Awards Held by Non-Continuing Service Providers_. Each
Company Stock Award that is held by a Person other than a Continuing Service
Provider shall not be assumed or otherwise substituted by Parent (a "
_Terminating Award_ "), and each such Terminating Award shall be canceled or
terminated at the Effective Time without consideration.

(e) _Necessary Actions; Form S-8_.

 

(i) The Company shall, at Parents direction (which is hereby given pursuant
to this Agreement), take all actions necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 1.8_ under all Company Plans and Company Stock
Awards or any other plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering
all required notices, obtaining all necessary consents, and making any
determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof.

(ii) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days following the Effective Time), if available for use by Parent,
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form
S-8 (or other appropriate form) relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable with respect to assumed or converted Company Stock Awards under this
_Section 1.8_ and, in connection with assumption of the Company Stock Awards
contemplated by this _Section 1.8_, shall file with NYSE a Supplemental
Listing Application (or such other form as may be required by NYSE) relating
to such assumed Company Stock Awards. Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses required thereby) for so long
as shares remain issuable pursuant to assumed or converted Company Stock
Awards. Parent shall give holders written notice of their assumed or
converted Company Stock Awards within five (5) Business Days after the
Effective Time stating that their Company Stock Awards have been assumed by
Parent and shall continue in effect on substantially the same terms and
conditions (subject to adjustment required by this _Section 1.8)_ after
giving effect to the merger and the terms of the Company Plans.

(f)  _Assumption of Company 2004 Plan_. Following the Effective Time, if and
only if Parent provides a written notice to the Company no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall assume and will be able
to grant equity-based awards, to the extent permissible by applicable Law and
NYSE rules, under the terms of the Company 2004 Plan or the terms of another
plan adopted by Parent to issue the reserved but unissued Company shares under
the Company 2004 Plan and the shares that would otherwise return to the
Company 2004 Plan pursuant to _Section 4.2(a)_ thereof (which provides that
each award that lapses, expires, terminates or is canceled prior to the
issuance of shares thereunder or if shares of Company Common Stock are issued
under the Company 2004 Plan to a holder and thereafter are forfeited to or
otherwise reacquired by the Company, the shares subject to such awards and the
forfeited or reacquired shares shall again be available for issuance under
the 2004 Plan), except that (i) Company shares covered by such awards will be
shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) all references to a number of Company
shares will be (A) changed to reference Parent Common Stock and (B) converted
to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the
number of Company shares multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock. The Company shall take
all actions in furtherance of this _Section 1.8(f)_ as Parent may reasonably
request. Unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that the Company
2004 Plan will be assumed, the Company shall terminate the Company 2004 Plan
in accordance with _Section 5.10_.

(g) _Parent Election to Cancel and Cash-Out Vested Company Options and Vested
Company Stock Appreciation Rights_.

(i) Notwithstanding _Sections 1.8(a)_ and _1.8(c)_ , if Parent reasonably
determines, after consultation with the Company, that the Total Stock Amount
(prior to giving effect to any cash out of vested Company Options and vested
Company Stock Appreciation Rights under this _Section 1.8(g)_) would
otherwise equal or exceed the Stock Threshold, Parent shall, in accordance
with this _Section 1.8(g),_ cash out at least that number of vested Company
Options (which may include any Company Options that will accelerate as a
result of 

 



-6-   the Merger) identified by Parent (" _Identified Options_ ") and/or vested
Company Stock Appreciation Rights (which may include any Company Stock
Appreciation Rights that will accelerate as a result of the Merger)
identified by Parent (" _Identified Stock Appreciation Rights_ "), in each
case held by Continuing Service Providers, such that the Total Stock Amount
would no longer equal or exceed the Stock Threshold. Parent agrees to
determine the identity (including without limitation the allocation between
Identified Options and Identified Stock Appreciation Rights) and the aggregate
number of, the Identified Options and/or Identified Stock Appreciation Rights
to be so cashed out in an objective manner using the following criteria. The
vested Company Options and vested Company Stock Appreciation Rights shall be
sorted in order from highest exercise price to lowest exercise price. Those
vested Company Options and vested Company Stock Appreciation Rights with the
highest exercise price shall be cashed out first. To the extent that it is not
necessary to cash out all of the vested Company Options and vested Company
Stock Appreciation Rights with a particular exercise price, then within such
tranche of vested Company Options and vested Company Stock Appreciation Rights
with a particular exercise price, those vested Company Options and vested
Company Stock Appreciation Rights will be sorted in order by seniority at the
Company (based on position, not length of service). Those vested Company
Options and vested Company Stock Appreciation Rights held by the individuals
with the highest seniority shall be cashed out first. To the extent that it
is not necessary to cash out all of the vested Company Options and vested
Company Stock Appreciation Rights held by all of the individuals with a
particular level of seniority, then within such tranche by seniority, the
vested Company Options and vested Company Stock Appreciation Rights shall be
cashed out pro rata among the individuals with that level of seniority. In
case of any questions regarding the interpretation of this Section 1.8(g),
the determination of Parents Board of Directors shall be final and binding.
Parent shall provide the Company written notice no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date of its determination to cash out the
Identified Options and the Identified Stock Appreciation Rights in accordance
with this _Section 1.8(g)_.

 

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Identified Option (or portion thereof)
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of
the Merger be cancelled, terminated and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, with respect to each share underlying such
Identified Option, equal to the excess, if any, of the Cash-Out
Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Identified Option
(such amount being hereinafter referred to as the " _Option Consideration_ ").
If the exercise price per share of any such Identified Option is equal to or
greater than the Cash-Out Consideration, such Identified Option shall be
cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. The payment
of Option Consideration to the holder of a Identified Option shall be reduced
by any income or employment tax withholding required under any applicable
Law.

(iii) At the Effective Time, each Identified Stock Appreciation Right
(or portion thereof) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, by virtue of the Merger be cancelled, terminated and converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, with respect to
each share underlying such Identified Stock Appreciation Right, equal to the
excess, if any, of the Cash-Out Consideration over the per share exercise
price of such Identified Stock Appreciation Right (such amount being
hereinafter referred to as the " _SAR Consideration_ "). If the exercise
price per share of any such Identified Stock Appreciation Right is equal to or
greater than the Cash-Out Consideration, such Identified Stock Appreciation
Right shall be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect
thereof. The payment of SAR Consideration to the holder of a Identified Stock
Appreciation shall be reduced by any income or employment tax withholding
required under any applicable Law.

 

1.9 _Exchange Fund; Exchange of Shares_ _; Payment of Option Consideration and
SAR Consideration_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_.

(i) Prior to the date on which Parent and the Company shall disseminate the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Parent shall select a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the exchange agent for the
Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").

 



-7-  (ii) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this _Article I_ , the following:

 

(A) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to issue all Stock
Consideration issuable pursuant to  _Section 1.7(b)(i)_;

(B) cash in an amount sufficient to pay all Cash Consideration payable
pursuant to  _Section 1.7(b)(i)_; and

(C) cash in an amount sufficient to make all requisite payments of cash in
lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)(iii)_ and any
dividends or other distributions which holders of shares of Company Common
Stock may be entitled pursuant to _Section 1.9(c)_.

 

All shares of Parent Common Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent
pursuant hereto shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."
Pursuant to irrevocable instructions, the Exchange Agent shall promptly
deliver the Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund to the former Company
shareholders who are entitled thereto pursuant to _Section 1.7_. 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time) of a certificate that represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "
_Certificate_ "), and each holder of record of uncertificated shares of
Company Common Stock represented by book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_
") as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (A) a letter of transmittal
in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for
the Merger Consideration issuable and payable in respect thereof
(in accordance with _Section 1.7(b)_) and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holders is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section 1.9(c)_.

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent (or
upon receipt of an appropriate agents message in the case of Book-Entry
Shares), together with a letter of transmittal, properly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of
such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (A) the number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all Certificates surrendered by such holder
of record) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)(i)_
(which, at the election of Parent, may be in uncertificated book entry form
unless a physical certificate is requested by the holder of record or is
otherwise required by applicable Law), (B) the cash amounts such holders are
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)(i)_, (C) the cash payable in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)(iii)_, and (D) any dividends or
distributions to which such holders are entitled pursuant to _Section
1.9(c)_, and any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as
the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on
any cash amounts payable upon the surrender of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares pursuant to this _Section 1.9_. Until so surrendered,
outstanding Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed, from and after
the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration issuable and payable in respect thereof and any
dividends or distributions payable or issuable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 1.9(c)_. Exchange of Book-Entry Shares shall be effected in
accordance with the customary procedures in respect of shares represented by
book entry on the stock ledger of the Company.

 



-8-  (c) _Dividends and Other Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made after the date hereof with respect to Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time, and no payment in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)(iii)_, will be paid to the
holders of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares with respect
to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of
record of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall surrender such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of _Section
1.9(b)_. Subject to applicable Law, promptly following the surrender of any
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to
the record holders thereof, without interest, any dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and, at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that shares of Parent Common Stock
are to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered (including as a result of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that has not been
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company), it will be a
condition of the issuance of such shares of Parent Common Stock that the
Certificates so surrendered are properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form
for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to
Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in any
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered,
or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by
Parent) that such transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not
payable.

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any Person such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under Law. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or
withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At the request of Parent, any portion of
the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed or unclaimed on the date that is
six (6) months immediately following the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, and any holders of the Certificates who have not
theretofore surrendered Certificates in compliance with this _Section 1.9_
shall thereafter look only to Parent for issuance or payment of the Merger
Consideration issuable and payable in respect thereto pursuant to _Section
1.7(b)_ and issuance and payment of any dividends or other distributions
payable or issuable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 1.9(c)_. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed or unclaimed as of
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration that is issuable and payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 1.7(b)_ and any dividends or distributions issuable or payable in
respect thereof pursuant to _Section 1.9(c)_; _provided, however_ , that
Parent and/or the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owners of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be 

 



-9-   made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

(i) _Payment of Option Consideration and SAR Consideration_. If Parent cashes
out Identified Options and/or Identified SARs pursuant to _Section 1.8(g)_,
Parent will pay or cause to be paid to holders of Identified Options and
Identified SARs, an amount equal to the Option Consideration and SAR
Consideration no later than the 30th day after the Effective Time. 

1.10 _Taking of Necessary Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors and officers of the
Company and Merger Sub shall take all such lawful and necessary action.

ARTICLE II 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to
Parent dated as of the date hereof (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "),
which expressly identifies the Section (and, if applicable, subsection) to
which such exception relates (it being understood and hereby agreed that any
disclosure set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule relating to one
Section or subsection of this Agreement shall also apply to any other Sections
and subsections of this Agreement if and to the extent that it is readily
apparent on the face of such disclosure (without reference to the underlying
documents referenced therein) that such disclosure also relates to such other
Sections or subsections), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent
and Merger Sub as follows:

2.1 _Organization and Standing_. The Company is a corporation duly organized
and validly existing and has the requisite corporate power and authority to
carry on its business as it is presently being conducted and to own, lease or
operate its respective properties and assets. The Company is duly qualified to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character
of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such
qualification necessary (except to the extent the "good standing" concept is
not applicable in any relevant jurisdiction), except where the failure to be
so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has delivered or
made available to Parent complete and correct copies of (a) the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company, in each case as in effect on
the date hereof, and (b) all actions taken by written consent and all minutes
(or, in the case of draft minutes or written consents, the most recent drafts
thereof) of all meetings of the shareholders, the Company Board and each
committee of the Company Board since January 1, 2010, except for such
portions of the minutes of the Company Board or any committee of the Committee
Board with respect to the consideration by such directors of the possible
acquisition of the Company. The Company is not and has never been in
violation of its articles of incorporation or bylaws.

2.2 _Authorization and Enforceability_.

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and subject to obtaining the Requisite Company
Shareholder Approval, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger) and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company
of its obligations hereunder, and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company other than, in the case of the
consummation of the Merger, obtaining the Requisite Company Shareholder
Approval, and no additional corporate actions or proceedings on the part of
the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company, 

 



-10-   enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that
such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting or relating to
creditors rights generally and is subject to general principles of equity.

(b) At a meeting duly called and held on May 6, 2013, the Company Board
unanimously adopted resolutions (i) determining that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) are advisable, fair
to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders, (ii)
adopting this Agreement and approving the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger), (iii) resolving to submit this Agreement to the
shareholders of the Company for approval in accordance with the WBCA (the "
_Merger Proposal_ ") and (iv) recommending that the shareholders of the
Company approve the Merger Proposal at the Company Shareholder Meeting. As of
the date hereof, the Company Board has not rescinded or modified in any way
the foregoing resolutions.

(c) Assuming that the representations of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in
_Section 3.12_ are accurate, the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, voting together as
a class, in favor of the Merger Proposal (the " _Requisite Company
Shareholder Approval_ "), is the only vote of the holders of any class or
series of Company Capital Stock necessary (under applicable Law or otherwise)
to approve and adopt this Agreement and consummate the Merger.

 

(d) Assuming that the representations of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in
_Section 3.12_ are accurate, the Company Board has taken all necessary
actions so that the restrictions on significant business transactions set
forth in Chapter 23B.19 of the WBCA are not applicable to this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger), or the
Voting Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby. No other
"control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other antitakeover
Law (such Law, including Section 23B.19 of the WBCA, " _Takeover Law_ ")
applies to this Agreement, the Voting Agreements or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) or thereby.

(e) As of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
terminated, amended or waived any rights under (or failed to enforce by
seeking an injunction or by seeking to specifically enforce the terms of) any
"standstill" or other similar agreement between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any other Person.

2.3 _Non-contravention; Governmental Consents_.

(a) The execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this Agreement,
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger) and the compliance by the Company with any of the terms
hereof do not and will not (i) violate or conflict with any provision of the
articles of incorporation or bylaws or other equivalent constituent documents
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) subject to obtaining the
consents set forth in _Section 2.3_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules,
violate, conflict with, or result in the breach of or constitute a default (or
an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default)
under, or result in the termination of, or accelerate the performance
required by, or result in a right of termination or acceleration under, any
Material Contract, (iii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
_Section 2.3(b)_ and, in the case of the consummation of the Merger, subject
to obtaining the Requisite Company Shareholder Approval, violate or conflict
with any Law or Order applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
by which any of their properties or assets are bound or (iv) result in
the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of each of clauses (ii), (iii)
and (iv) above, for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults,
terminations, accelerations or Liens which would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken together as a whole.

(b) No consent, approval, Order or authorization of, or filing or registration
with, or notification to (any of the foregoing being a " _Consent_ "), any
Governmental Authority is required on the part of the

 



-11-   Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation
by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Merger), except (i) the filing and recordation of the Articles of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Washington with respect to the Merger,
(ii) such filings and approvals as may be required by any U.S. federal, state
or non-U.S. securities laws or rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
(iii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and any other
Antitrust Law and (iv) such other Consents, the failure of which to obtain
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, be
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken together as a whole.

2.4 _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) one hundred
twenty million (120,000,000) shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) thirty

(d) To the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred and
there currently exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection
with which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could be subject to any
material liability under the terms of any Employee Plan, ERISA, the Code or
codes of practice issued by any Governmental Authority, Collective Bargaining
Agreement or any other applicable Law. Except as required by Law or that would

in the imposition of a penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or
a tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code, in each case applicable to the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Employee Plan or for which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries has any indemnification obligation.

-22-   any other person that such employee(s) or other person would be provided
with post-termination benefits, except to the extent required by applicable
Law.

 

(h) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be "qualified" under Section 401 of
the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS to such
effect and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no fact, circumstance or event
has occurred or exists since the date of such determination letter that would
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the qualified
status of any such Employee Plan.

(i) All contributions, premiums and other payments required to be made with
respect to any Employee Plan have been timely made, accrued or reserved for in

alone or in conjunction with any other event, (i) result in any payment or
benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to any director,
employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise
payable or required to be provided to any such director, employee or
independent contractor, or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of
payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit or compensation. _Section
2.15(j)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists each Company "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code). No payment or benefit
which will or may be made by the Company or its ERISA Affiliates with respect
to any current or former employee or any other disqualified individual will

any notification of a plant closing or mass layoff required by the WARN Act or
similar state, local or foreign Law, or incurred any Liability or obligation
under the WARN Act or any similar state or local Law that remains

the Closing would trigger any notice or other obligations under the WARN Act
or similar state, local or foreign Law.

Person (other than Parent and Merger Sub) which has heretofore executed a

returned or destroyed (to the extent destruction of such information is
permitted by such confidentiality agreement) and to enforce the provisions of
any "standstill" or other similar agreement between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any Person (other than Parent). Such written requests shall
contain a notice to each Person that any information that is sent to the
Company in the future will not be treated as confidential pursuant to such
confidentiality agreement.

 

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the

submission or announcement of, an Acquisition Proposal;

Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger

expected to assist or facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal

that is seeking to make or has made an Acquisition Proposal except to state

provisions;

recommend, an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Transaction;

 

(v) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or other
Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal or an
Acquisition Transaction;

an injunction or by seeking to specifically enforce the terms of) any
confidentiality or "standstill" or other similar agreement between the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and any other Person;

 

(vii) take any action to exempt any Person, other than Parent and Merger Sub,
from Section 23B.19 of the WBCA or any other applicable Takeover Law; or

(viii) agree to do any of the foregoing, or propose to do any of the foregoing

-38-  (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 5.1(b)_, subject to
the Companys compliance with the provisions of this _Section 5.1_, at any
time prior to receipt of the Requisite Company Shareholder Approval, the
Company Board may (directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or
other intermediaries) (x) engage or participate in discussions or
negotiations with any Person that has made (and not withdrawn) a _bona fide_ ,
written Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof that (A) did not result
from a breach of this  _Section 5.1_, (B) does not violate the terms of any
standstill, non-disclosure or other similar Contract with the Company or any
of its Affiliates, (and (C) the Company Board concludes in good faith (after
consultation with the Financial Advisor or any other financial advisor of
nationally recognized standing and outside legal counsel) constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and/or (y) furnish any non-
public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
Person that has made (and not withdrawn) a _bona fide_ , written Acquisition
Proposal after the date hereof that (A) did not result from a breach of this
_Section 5.1_, (B) does not violate the terms of any standstill, non-
disclosure or other similar Contract with the Company or any of its
Affiliates, and (C) the Company Board concludes in good faith (after
consultation with the Financial Advisor or any other financial advisor of
nationally recognized standing and outside legal counsel) constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, _provided, however,_ that in
the case of clauses (x) or (y):

 

(i) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have breached or
violated (or be deemed, pursuant to the terms of this  _Section 5.1_, to
have breached or violated) the terms of this _Section 5.1_;

(ii) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that the failure of the Company Board to take such
action would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the shareholders of the Company under Washington Law;

(iii) the Company has entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal containing terms and provisions that (A) are
at least as protective of the Company as those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (disregarding any amendment made pursuant to
_Section 5.8_), (B) expressly permit the Company to comply with the terms of
this _Section 5.1_ and _Section 5.6(b)_ and (C) include "standstill"
restrictions that are the same as those set forth in Section 11 of the

_provided, however,_ that such confidentiality agreement may provide that any
such Person may make a confidential proposal regarding an Acquisition
Transaction directly to the Company Board, notwithstanding such "standstill"
restrictions;

(iv) at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to engaging or participating in
any such discussions or negotiations with, or furnishing any non-public
information to, such Person, the Company gives Parent written notice of the
identity of such Person and the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal (and if such Acquisition Proposal is in written form,
the Company shall give Parent a true and complete copy thereof along with any
other written materials provided in connection therewith) and of the Companys
intention to engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with, or
furnish non-public information to, such Person; and

(v) contemporaneously with furnishing any non-public information to such
Person, the Company furnishes such non-public information to Parent (to the
extent such information has not been previously furnished by the Company to
Parent).

 

(d) The Company shall promptly, and in all cases within twenty four (24) hours
of its receipt, notify Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Acquisition
Proposal received by the Company or any of its Representatives, (ii) any

or inquiry.

 

(e) In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall provide Parent with at
least twenty-four (24) hours prior written notice of a meeting of the Company
Board (or any committee thereof) at which the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal, an
inquiry relating to a potential Acquisition Proposal, or a request to provide
non-public information to any Person.

(f) The Company shall not (and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to) enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or Contract subsequent
to the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing the
information described in this _Section 5.1_.

 

(g) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company acknowledge and hereby agree that any action taken by any
Representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would be a
breach of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.1_ if taken by the
Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.1_ by the Company
for all purposes of and under this Agreement.

5.2 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other

Company hereunder (including, without limitation, the consents of all lessors
of Leased Real Property) shall be paid and borne entirely by the Company, and

reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
expressly understood and agreed that: (i) neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare, and Parent shall file with

Registration Statement shall include (i) a prospectus for the issuance of
shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and (ii) a proxy statement of the
Company for use in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the Merger

Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing with the SEC.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and
Parent shall, and shall cause its respective Representatives to, fully

Recommendation.

 



-41-  (c) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement or as may be required by
applicable Law or Order, neither Parent nor the Company shall effect any
amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement without the prior consent
of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned); _provided, however_ , that the Company, in connection with a
Company Board Recommendation Change, may amend or supplement the proxy
statement for the Company pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment to effect such
change, and in such event, the right of approval set forth in this _Section
5.4(c)_ shall apply only with respect to such information relating to the
other party or its business, financial condition or results of operations,
and shall be subject to the Companys right to have the deliberations and
conclusions of the Company Board accurately described. A " _Qualifying
Amendment_ " means an amendment or supplement to the proxy statement for the
Company if and solely to the extent that it contains (i) a Company Board
Recommendation Change, (ii) a statement of the reasons of the Company Board
for making such Company Board Recommendation Change, and (iii)
additional information reasonably related to the foregoing.

requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the information supplied or to be supplied by any
party hereto for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration
Statement shall not, at the time the Registration Statement is filed with the
SEC or declared effective by the SEC or at the Effective Time, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading. The information supplied or to be supplied by any
party hereto for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall not, on the date the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first
mailed to shareholders, or at the time of the Company Shareholder Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The information
supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of either party hereto for
inclusion in any filing pursuant to Rule 165 and Rule 425 under the Securities
Act or Rule 14a-12 or Rule 14a-6(j) under the Exchange Act (each, a "
_Regulation M-A Filing_ ") shall not, at the time any such Regulation M-A
Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall
notify each other as promptly as practicable upon becoming aware of any event
or circumstance which should be described in an amendment of, or supplement
to, the Registration Statement, Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Regulation
M-A Filing so that any such document would not include any misstatement of
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and as promptly as
practicable thereafter, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law or the SEC, disseminated to the shareholders of
Parent and/or the Company. Parent and the Company shall each notify the other
as promptly as practicable after the receipt by it of any written or oral
comments of the SEC or its staff on, or of any written or oral request by the
SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to, the Registration Statement,
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Regulation M-A Filing, and shall
promptly supply the other with copies of all correspondence between it or any
of its representatives and the SEC or its staff with respect to any of the
foregoing filings.

 

(e) Parent and the Company shall make any necessary filings with respect to
the Merger under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. In addition, Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to take all actions required under any
applicable federal or state securities or Blue Sky Law in connection with the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger.

 

5.5 _Company Shareholder Meeting_.

(a) The Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the Company shareholders (the " _Company
Shareholder Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable following

 



-42-   the date hereof for the purpose of voting upon the Merger Proposal. The
Company shall convene and hold the Company Shareholder Meeting within forty-
five (45) days following the date on which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is
first disseminated to Company shareholders. Unless otherwise required by
applicable Law or Order, the Company shall not postpone the Company
Shareholder Meeting after the date on which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is
first disseminated to Company shareholders, or adjourn the Company Shareholder
Meeting, unless (i) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
present in person or represented by proxy at the Company Shareholder Meeting
in order to conduct business at the Company Shareholder Meeting or (ii)
Parent provides its prior written consent or Parent requests such a
postponement or adjournment.

(b) The Company shall solicit from the Company shareholders proxies in favor
of the Merger Proposal, and unless the Company Board has effected a Company
Board Recommendation Change pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of
_Section 5.6_, the Company Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Requisite Company Shareholder Approval at the Company Shareholder
Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof. At the Company
Shareholder Meeting, the Company shall submit to a vote of its shareholders
the Merger Proposal. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to
_Article VII_ , the Company shall establish a record date for, call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting for the purpose
of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Washington
Law, whether or not the Company Board at any time subsequent to the date

or otherwise affected by, the commencement, disclosure, announcement or

(a) Subject to the terms of _Section 5.6(b)_ and _Section 5.6(c)_, the
Company Board shall (i) recommend that the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock approve this Agreement in accordance with the applicable provisions of
Washington Law (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ") and (ii) include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Subject to the
terms of this  _Section 5.6_, neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation (a " _Company Board
Recommendation Change_ ").

(b) Notwithstanding the terms of  _Section 5.6(a)_, subject to the
provisions of this _Section 5.6(b)_, at any time prior to receipt of the
Requisite Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change if:

 

(i) the Company Board has received a _bona fide_ , written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach of  _Section 5.1_ that
constitutes a Superior Proposal;

(ii) the Company received the Acquisition Proposal from a Person that is not
in breach of its contractual obligations to the Company or any Subsidiary
under a standstill, nondisclosure agreement or other similar Contract;

 



-43-  (iii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have breached or
violated (or be deemed, pursuant to the terms hereof, to have breached or
violated) the provisions of _Section 5.1_;

(iv) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel and after considering in good faith any counter-offer or
proposal made by Parent pursuant to clause (vi) below), that, in light of such
Superior Proposal, the failure of the Company Board to make a Company Board
Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of
its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under Washington Law;

 

(v) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
Board shall have given Parent at least three (3) Business Days notice thereof
(which notice shall include the most current version of such definitive
agreement and, to the extent not included therein, the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making
such Superior Proposal) and the opportunity to meet with the Company Board,
the Financial Advisor and its outside legal counsel during such three (3)
Business Day period, all with the purpose and intent of enabling Parent and
the Company to discuss in good faith a modification of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger) may be effected; and

 

(vi) Parent shall not have made, within three (3) Business Days after receipt
of the Companys written notice of its intention to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change, a counter-offer or proposal that the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Financial Advisor or a
financial advisor of nationally recognized standing and outside
legal counsel, is at least as favorable to shareholders of the Company as
such Superior Proposal (it being understood that any change to the financial
terms or any other material term or condition of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new notice pursuant to clause (iv) above and a new three (3)
Business Day period pursuant to this clause (vi)) (it being further understood
that there may be multiple extensions of such three (3) Business Day period).

 

(c) Notwithstanding the terms of _Section 5.6(a)_, at any time prior to
receipt of the Requisite Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening
Event if:

(i) the Intervening Event does not involve the receipt of an offer, proposal
or inquiry from any third party relating to a transaction of the nature
described in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" (which, for purposes
of this clause (i), shall be read without reference to the percentage
thresholds set forth in the definition thereof);

(ii) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel and after considering in good faith any counter-offer or
proposal made by Parent pursuant to clause (iv) below) that, in light of such
Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board to make a Company Board
Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of
its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under Washington Law;

 

(iii) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
Board shall have given Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior written
notice thereof, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the facts
underlying the Company Boards determination that an Intervening Event has
occurred and the rationale and basis for such Company Board Recommendation
Change, and the opportunity to meet with the Company Board and its outside
legal counsel during such five (5) Business Day period, all with the purpose
and intent of enabling Parent and the Company to discuss in good faith a
modification of the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) may be effected; and

 



-44-  (iv) following the expiration of the five (5)-Business Day period after
Parents receipt of the Companys written notice of its intention to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, and after giving good
faith consideration to any counter-offer or proposal from Parent that, in
light of such Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board to make a
Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to constitute
a breach of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under
Washington Law (it being understood that any material change to the facts,
events, developments or set of circumstances of the Intervening Event shall
require a new notice pursuant to clause (ii) above and a new five (5)
Business Day period pursuant to this clause (iii)) (it being further
understood that there may be multiple extensions of such five (5) Business Day
period).

 

(d) The Company shall ensure that any Company Board Recommendation Change: (A)
does not change or otherwise affect the approval of this Agreement by the
Company Board or any other approval of the Company Board; and (B) does not
have the effect of causing any Takeover Law (including Section 23B.19 of the
WBCA) to be applicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreements, the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger).
The Company shall keep confidential any proposals made by Parent to revise the
terms of this Agreement, other than in the event of any amendment to
this Agreement and to the extend required to be disclosed in any SEC Reports.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking
and disclosing to the Company shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided, however_ , that any
statement(s) made by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the provisions of _Article
VII_ ; and  _provided further_ , that any such statements (other than a
"stop, look and listen communication" of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, and within the time period contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f)(3)) shall be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change
unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation in connection with such statement.

be expected to be in excess of $100,000 (each of the matters referenced in the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to herein as a " _Legal
Proceeding Matter_ "). The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
consult with the Company regarding the defense or settlement of any such Legal
Proceeding Matter and shall consider in good faith Parents views with
respect to such Legal Proceeding Matter, and the Company shall not settle any
such Legal Proceeding Matter without the prior written consent of Parent.

(e) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Effective Time, the

statement and other document proposed to be filed by the Company with the SEC
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or
federal or state laws a reasonable period of time prior to the filing of such
reports, schedules, proxy or information statements, registration statements
and other documents (and in any event at least two (2) Business Days prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC).

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
information obtained pursuant to the access granted or notification provided
pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall be deemed to (i) amend or otherwise
modify in any respect any representation or warranty of the party hereto

that Parent and the Company have previously executed a letter agreement,
dated December 27, 2012 (as may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which will continue in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms; _provided, however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, effective as of the execution and delivery
hereof, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be amended so as to
permit Parent to take any action contemplated by this Agreement, including
the making of any counter-offer or proposal contemplated by _Section 5.6(b)_

-46-   without the prior written consent of Parent, issue any press release or
otherwise make any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the

Proposal, except as may be required by Law or any listing agreement with a
national securities exchange, in which case the Company shall make
commercially reasonable efforts to consult with Parent prior to any such
release or public statement.

5.10 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, each of
the Company and any ERISA Affiliate shall terminate any and all Employee Plans
intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a " _401(k)
Plan_ ") (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that such
401(k) Plans shall not be terminated). Unless Parent provides such written
notice to the Company, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such
Employee Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or
such Affiliate, as the case may be. The form and substance of such resolutions
shall be subject to the reasonable review and approval of Parent. The Company
also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such
Employee Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably require. In the event that
termination of a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger
liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees then the Company shall
take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such
charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later
than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the Closing Date. If, in accordance
with this _Section 5.10(a)_, Parent requests in writing that the Company not
terminate any 401(k) Plan, the Company shall take such actions as Parent may
reasonably require in furtherance of the assumption of any such 401(k) Plan by
Parent, including, but not limited to, adopting such amendments as Parent may
deem necessary or advisable in connection with such assumption.

(b) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the
Company shall terminate the Company 2004 Plan (unless Parent provides written
notice to the Company no later than five (5) Business Days prior to Closing
that the Company 2004 Plan shall not be terminated and instead assumed).

(c) The Company shall consult with Parent (and consider in good faith the
advice of Parent) prior to sending any notices or other communication
materials to Company employees and the Company shall not send any written
notices or other written communication materials (including via electronic
mail) to Company employees regarding this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) without the prior written consent
of Parent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld) or make any
communications with the employees that are inconsistent with this Agreement.

5.11 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under their
respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and equivalent
organizational documents) and all indemnification agreements in effect
and disclosed to Parent in _Section 5.11_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
as of the date of this Agreement between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors and
officers (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ").

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain in effect the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect of acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each
person covered by the DandO Insurance immediately prior to the Effective Time,
on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than those of the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may, at its
option, substitute therefor policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries containing terms with

 



-47-   respect to coverage and amounts no less favorable, in the aggregate, to such
persons than the DandO Insurance, _provided further, however_ , that in
satisfying its obligations under this  _Section 5.11(b)_, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess
of two hundred percent (200%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage
for its last full fiscal year (such two hundred percent (200%) amount, the "
_Maximum Annual Premium_ ") (which premiums the Company represents and
warrants to be as set forth in _Section 5.11_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule), _provided that_ that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy (the " _Tail Policy_ ")
on the DandO Insurance on terms and conditions no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than the DandO Insurance and for an amount not to exceed two hundred
percent (200%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last
full fiscal year. In the event that the Company does not purchase the Tail
Policy, Parent may purchase a Tail Policy on the DandO Insurance on terms and
conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the DandO Insurance. In the
event that either the Company or Parent shall purchase such a Tail Policy
prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain such Tail Policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their
respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this _Section
5.11(b)_ for so long as such Tail Policy shall be maintained in full force and
effect.

(c) Each of the Indemnified Parties or other persons who are beneficiaries
under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section 5.11(b)_
(and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.1_, with full rights of enforcement as if a
party thereto.

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
including in each case by way of an internal reorganization, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation (as applicable) shall cause proper provision to be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation (as
applicable) assume its obligations set forth in this _Section 5.11_. 

5.12 _Insurance Policies_. The Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to ensure that all of its current and legacy insurance policies are
available for the benefit of the Surviving Corporation, including with respect
any instances where an occurrence and/or claim takes place before the
Effective Time and is not made known until after the Effective Time.

5.13 _Resignation of Officers and Directors of Company Subsidiaries_. At or
prior to the Closing, upon the request of Parent, unless Parent instructs the
Company otherwise, the Company shall obtain the resignations (in form and
substance acceptable to Parent) of each individual serving as a director or
officer of (or comparable position with) the Company and its Subsidiaries
from his or her position as a director or officer of (or comparable position
with) the Company and its Subsidiaries, and not as an employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case to be effective as of the Effective
Time.

5.14 _Section 16 Resolutions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall
adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so
that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder of shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Stock Awards pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an
exempt transaction for purposes of such section. 

5.15 _NYSE Listing_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall file a Supplemental
Listing Application (or such other form as may be required by NYSE) with NYSE
with respect to the shares of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger.

 



-48-  5.16 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

5.17 _Anti-Takeover Statutes_. In the event that any Takeover Law is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Merger), the Company, at the direction of the Company
Board, shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger) may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger).

5.18 _MLS-Sourced Data_. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, or following the termination or expiration of any waiting
periods required by the HSR Act, whichever is later, the Company shall have
ceased to operate, directly or indirectly, any business or platform that
distributes MLS-Sourced Data to any website outside of the Partner Network
(excluding any website that the Company hosts and/or operates on behalf of an

Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Parent, certifying the

which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance
with their respective terms.

7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in _Section 7.3(b)_, all fees and expenses

(b) _Company Payments_.

(i) In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated under _Section 7.1(d)
and_ (B) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to

publicly announced or shall have become publicly known, or shall have been
communicated or otherwise made known to the Company, the Company shall pay to
Parent, promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) following
receipt of an invoice therefor, an amount in cash equal to the actual and
reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable
and documented fees and expenses of financial advisors, outside legal
counsel, accountants, experts, consultants and other service providers)
incurred by Parent and its Affiliates (or on their respective behalves) in
connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (" _Parent Expenses_ "), which amount shall not exceed $1,000,000. The
parties hereto hereby agreed that the existence of circumstances which could
require the Termination Fee Amount to become subsequently payable by the
Company pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)(ii)_ or _Section 7.3(b)(iii)_ shall not
relieve the Company of its obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to
this  _Section 7.3(b)(i)_, and that the payment by the Company of Parent
Expenses pursuant to this _Section 7.3(b)(i)_ shall not relieve the Company
of any subsequent obligation to pay Parent the Termination Fee Amount pursuant
to  _Section 7.3(b)(ii)_ or _Section 7.3(b)(iii)_.

(ii) The Company shall pay to Parent a fee equal to $15,000,000 (the "
_Termination Fee Amount_ "), less any Parent Expenses previously paid or
payable by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)(i)_, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing
by Parent, in the event that (A)(1) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(d)_ or (2) this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)(i)_, (B) following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement (in the case of
any termination referred to in subclause (A)(1) above) or prior to the breach
or inaccuracy that forms the basis for the termination of this Agreement (in
the case of any termination referred to in subclause (A)(2) above), an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or shall have become
publicly known, or shall have been communicated or otherwise made known to
the Company Board, and (C) within twelve (12) months following the termination
of this Agreement, either an Acquisition Transaction (whether or not the
Acquisition Transaction referenced in the preceding clause (B)) is
consummated or the Company enters into a letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding or other Contract providing for an Acquisition Transaction
(whether or not the Acquisition Transaction referenced in the preceding clause
(B)). For purposes of this  _Section 7.3(b)(ii)_, all references to "fifteen
percent (15%)" and "eighty-five percent (85%)" in the definition of
Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed references to "fifty percent (50%)".
The fee amount payable pursuant to this _Section 7.3(b)(ii)_ shall be paid
on the date of, and as a condition to, the consummation of the Acquisition
Transaction contemplated by the foregoing clause (C) or the execution and
effectiveness of the letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or other
Contract contemplated by the foregoing clause (C).

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1(f)(iii)_, the Company shall pay to Parent a fee equal to the Termination
Fee Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by Parent, within one Business Day after
demand by Parent.

 



-54-  (c) _Enforcement_. Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges and hereby
agrees that the provisions of this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without such
provisions, neither Parent nor the Company would have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company shall fail to pay in a timely manner
any amounts due and payable pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent shall make a claim against the Company and such
claim results in a judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay to
Parent an amount in cash equal to Parents costs and expenses (including its
attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such claim, together
with interest at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made. Payment of the fees amounts contemplated by
this _Section 7.3_ shall not be in lieu of, or replacement or substitution
for, any damages that may arise out of any breach of this Agreement, and are
not intended to (and shall not) be liquidated damages hereunder. The parties
acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay
the Termination Fee Amount on more than one occasion.
