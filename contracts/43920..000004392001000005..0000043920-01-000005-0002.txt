Purchase of the Shares  Subject to the terms and conditions set out in this
Agreement, the Seller shall on the Closing Date sell the Shares to the
Purchaser and the Purchaser shall on the Closing Date purchase the
Shares from the Seller. It is understood between the Parties that only the
Industrial Packaging Division shall be included in the sale; the Consumer
Packaging Division and the Excluded Assets shall be transferred by the
Company or the relevant Subsidiary to the Seller or a subsidiary thereof
other than a Subsidiary and the Included Assets (including any Subsidiary
Shares) presently held by entities in the Consumer Packaging Division shall
be transferred into the Company\'s Group, all in accordance with Article
7.2.  It is agreed between the Parties that the Seller may transfer
the Shares to one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries prior to the Closing, in
which case the Seller shall cause such subsidiary to assume all obligations
and rights of the Seller pursuant to this Agreement and the Seller\'s
Representations and Warranties shall be read as though they are given by such
subsidiary. Without prejudice to the preceding sentence, the Seller shall in
that case be jointly and severally liable towards the Purchaser for
any obligations thus assumed by that subsidiary and will cause
that subsidiary to perform its obligations under this Agreement.  It is
further agreed between the Parties that the Purchaser may designate one or
more wholly owned subsidiaries of the Purchaser to purchase the Shares, or
any of the Subsidiary Shares, in which case the Purchaser shall cause each
such subsidiary to assume all obligations and rights of the Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement and the Purchaser\'s Representations and
Warranties shall be read as though they are given by such subsidiary. Without
prejudice to the preceding sentence, the Purchaser shall in that case
be jointly and severally liable towards the Seller for any obligations thus
assumed by that subsidiary.  2.2 Transfer of the Shares  At Closing the
Seller shall transfer the Shares to the Purchaser through the signing by the
Parties of the Deed of Transfer, which will be passed by the Civil Law
Notary. At Closing the Parties shall further take such actions as are
required to be taken by Article 9 of this Agreement. The Seller undertakes to
cause the Company to acknowledge the transfer of the Shares on the
Closing Date by co-signing the Deed of Transfer and to duly enter
such transfer in the Company\'s register of shareholders
forthwith.  ARTICLE 3 PURCHASE PRICE AND PAYMENT  3.1 Purchase
Price  The purchase price for the Shares shall be the amount of
the Provisional Purchase Price (as defined in Article 3.2) adjusted
in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 (such adjusted amount to be
referred to as the "Purchase Price").  3.2 Provisional Purchase Price  In
order to determine the Provisional Purchase Price (as hereinafter defined),
the Seller shall make a reasonable best estimate of both the amount of the
Net Outstanding Indebtedness ("Estimated Net Outstanding Indebtedness") and
the Net Working Capital ("Estimated Net Working Capital"). In establishing
the amounts of the Estimated Net Outstanding Indebtedness and the Estimated
Net Working Capital, the Seller shall take into account the figures in the
last monthly accounts of the Industrial Packaging Division, and the Seller
shall use a conversion rate which is the European Central Bank fixed rate on
the date of its estimate.  Ultimately ten (10) days before the Closing Date
the Seller shall notify the Purchaser of the amount of the Estimated
Net Outstanding Indebtedness and the amount of the Estimated Net Working
Capital.  The Provisional Purchase Price (the "Provisional Purchase
Price") shall be a sum equal to US$ 620,000,000 (six hundred and
twenty million US dollars) minus the Estimated Net Outstanding Indebtedness,
if it represents a negative amount, or plus the Estimated Net Outstanding
Indebtedness, if it represents a positive amount, and shall be increased, if
the Estimated Net Working Capital is higher than the Pro Forma Accounts Net
Working Capital, or shall be decreased, if the Estimated Net Working Capital
is lower than the Pro Forma Accounts Net Working Capital, by the difference
between the Estimated Net Working Capital and the Pro Forma Accounts Net
Working Capital.  If the Provisional Purchase Price for the shares would
exceed US $ 620,000,000 (six hundred and twenty million US dollars),
the Seller will cause the Company to declare a dividend payable to
the Seller in an amount which is equal to the lower of (i) such excess and
(ii) the amount of the distributable reserves of the Company in order to
reduce the Provisional Purchase Price with the amount of such dividend. The
Seller and/or Huhtamaki Finance Oy will make a loan to the Company to the
extent there is not sufficient cash in the Company\'s Group to pay the
aforementioned dividend. The amount of such loan will be taken into account
by the Seller in calculating and estimating the Estimated Net
Outstanding Indebtedness.  Schedule 19 sets forth, for purposes of
illustration only, hypothetical calculations of the Provisional Purchase
Price based on the Pro Forma Accounts as if the Closing Date were December
31, 1999. It is understood that the Purchaser still has to obtain additional
comfort, and shall do so before 31 October 2000, on the US accounting
implications of the mechanism presented in said Schedule 19.  3.3
Payment  Attached hereto as Schedule 7 is a comfort letter from
Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation, bankers to the Purchaser, with respect to
the financing of the transaction.  The Provisional Purchase Price shall be
paid at the Closing in cash in same day funds. The Purchaser shall transfer
an amount equal to the Provisional Purchase Price one day before the
Closing Date to the bank account in the name of Derdengelden
Notarissen NautaDutilh Amsterdam with ABN AMRO Bank N.V. (account
number 41.57.69.779), with reference to file number 50037435.  The Civil
Law Notary shall hold the Provisional Purchase Price for the benefit of the
Seller immediately after the Deed of Transfer shall have been executed. The
Civil Law Notary is hereby instructed by the Parties to transfer the
Provisional Purchase Price after the Deed of Transfer shall have been
executed to the bank account of the Seller as to be directed by the Seller to
the Civil Law Notary prior to Closing.  ARTICLE 4 ADJUSTMENT TO PROVISIONAL
PURCHASE PRICE  4.1 Reduction of the Provisional Purchase Price  Should it
be found in accordance with the following provisions of this Article 4 that
the Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, then
the Provisional Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
established shortfall.  Should it be found in accordance with the following
provisions of this Article 4 that the amount of the Net Outstanding
Indebtedness is more negative or less positive than the amount of the
Estimated Net Outstanding Indebtedness, then the Provisional Purchase
Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the established
difference (such difference hereinafter to be referred to as the
"Net Outstanding Indebtedness Reduction Amount").  The sum of (i) the
shortfall in the Net Working Capital, if any, and (ii) the amount of the Net
Outstanding Indebtedness Reduction Amount, if any, pursuant to this Article
4.1 shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Reduction Amount".  4.2
Increase of the Provisional Purchase Price  Should it be found in accordance
with the following provisions of this Article 4 that the Net Working Capital
is in excess of the Estimated Net Working Capital, then the Provisional
Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to the established
excess.  Should it be found in accordance with the following provisions
of this Article 4 that the amount of the Net Outstanding Indebtedness is
more positive or less negative than the amount of the Estimated Net
Outstanding Indebtedness, then the Provisional Purchase Price shall be
increased by an amount equal to the established difference (such difference
hereinafter to be referred to as the "Net Outstanding Indebtedness Increase
Amount").  The sum of (i) the excess in the Net Working Capital, if any,
and (ii) the amount of the Net Outstanding Indebtedness Increase Amount, if
any, pursuant to this Article 4.2 shall hereinafter be referred to as the
"Increase Amount".  4.3 Closing Balance Sheet  For the purpose of
establishing the Net Working Capital and the Net Outstanding Indebtedness the
Seller shall prepare the Closing Balance Sheet in accordance with accounting
principles and practices consistent with the accounting principles and
practices applied with respect to the Pro Forma Accounts as if the
Closing were the year end. The Seller shall deliver documentation of
the relevant balance sheet items that constitute the Net
Outstanding Indebtedness and the Net Working Capital. The Closing
Balance Sheet shall be audited by KPMG at Subsidiary level and by Ernst
and Young Accountants at consolidated Company\'s Group level as involved by
the Seller in the same manner as the audit of the Pro Forma Accounts. The
Seller shall submit such audited Closing Balance Sheet no later than eight
weeks after the Closing Date to the Purchaser for the Purchaser to review and
to submit all its objections, if any, against such Closing Balance Sheet to
the Seller within six (6) weeks after the Closing Balance Sheet has been
submitted and the Minimum Supporting Data (as defined below) have been made
available to the Purchaser (the "Objection Date"). The Seller shall procure
that the Purchaser shall have access to the necessary supporting data,
including the KPMG and Ernst and Young working papers (collectively: the
"Supporting Data"). Schedule 20 lists the minimum Supporting Data (the
"Minimum Supporting Data") to be made available to the Purchaser. For
the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed that Supporting Data on Subsidiary
level is available locally, while all Supporting Data including Ernst and Young
working papers related to Company\'s Group consolidation is available in the
Netherlands. The Purchaser may participate in the physical inventory of the
Company\'s Group. Should the Parties fail to reach agreement on any objection
raised by the Purchaser within four weeks thereafter ("Disagreement Date"),
then any such unresolved matters or disputes (for the purpose of this Article
4: the "Open Issues") shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of
Article 4.4.  It is agreed between the Parties that events that occur after
the Closing shall not affect the Closing Balance Sheet.  The Seller and the
Purchaser shall use their best efforts to agree before Closing on the
actuarial valuation assumptions to be used for the purpose of establishing
the Closing Balance Sheet for unfunded pension liabilities and pre-pension
and post and early retirement obligations. Such actuarial valuation
assumptions will be consistent with those typically used by similar plans in
the relevant countries at the Closing Date. In the absence of
such agreement, such actuarial assumptions shall be established by
an independent third-party actuary selected by the Parties
jointly ultimately within two weeks after the Closing Date, or,
failing agreement on such election, by the relevant country\'s
professional actuarial body with the costs shared equally by the Parties, or
as agreed to by the Seller and the Purchaser.  It is agreed between the
Parties that the post-retirement scheme liability in South Africa amounting
at January 1, 2000 to approximately EUR 3,700,000, equivalent to SAR
23,077,000 as disclosed in Alexander Forbes\'s Report on the Actuarial
Valuation of the Employer\'s Liability in respect of Health Care Benefits
for Retirees of Van Leer SA as at 1 January 2000, will be recalculated as of
the Closing Date and included under "Provisions for liabilities and other
charges" in the Closing Balance Sheet for purposes of the determination of
Net Outstanding Indebtedness whether or not such liability would otherwise
have been required under applicable accounting principles to be included in
the Closing Balance Sheet. In addition, the Parties will, as soon
as practicable before Closing, determine for the purposes of establishing
the Closing Balance Sheet the correct accounting treatment of the US cash
surrender value life insurance of US$ 4,226,000, including whether or not
such item should be included under "Provisions for liabilities and other
charges" in the Closing Balance Sheet for purposes of the determination of
the Net Outstanding Indebtedness.  The Parties will, as soon as practicable
before Closing, agree for the purposes of establishing the Closing Balance
Sheet whether the liability in France relating to the provision for medical
and life insurance benefits for former employees between early
retirement and age 65 and/or the liability in France relating to the
benefits arising from the early retirement convention, should be
included under "Provisions for liabilities and other charges" in the Closing
Balance Sheet for purposes of the determination of the Net Outstanding
Indebtedness.  Accruals in the Closing Balance Sheet for performance
incentives relating to the period from 1 January 2000 through the
Closing Date relating to the key management employees listed in Annex 9
as well as the business unit managers of the Industrial Packaging Division
shall be accounted for as indebtedness in the Net Outstanding
Indebtedness.  To the extent that at Closing, the Company\'s Group will
still hold Excluded Assets belonging to the Consumer Packaging Division,
the Closing Balance Sheet will be adjusted in order to exclude such Excluded
Assets. To the extent that at Closing, the Company\'s Group will not yet hold
all Included Assets and the Subsidiary Shares, the Closing Balance Sheet will
be adjusted in order to include such Included Assets and Subsidiary Shares.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Closing Balance Sheet will include
the Mexican loan, the USA loan and the German loan and only such other loans
necessitated by the Reorganisation that Purchaser approves of.  Should the
Purchaser have failed to submit its objections against the Closing Balance
Sheet to the Seller by the Objection Date, then the Closing Balance Sheet and
the Net Working Capital and the Net Outstanding Indebtedness reflected
therein shall be deemed to have been finally established for the purpose of
this Agreement.  The Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the Company\'s
Group shall, give all information and assistance to the Seller and
the auditors of Ernst and Young involved by the Seller as required
or desirable for the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet.  4.4 Open
Issues  If so agreed between the Parties as set forth in Article 14.2,
the Open Issues shall be submitted to and settled by an accountant of an
independent reputable firm of accountants (for the purpose of this Article
4.4 to be referred to as the "Accountant") to be jointly appointed by the
Parties within three weeks after Disagreement Date or, if the Parties fail to
agree on such appointment within that period, by the Chairman of the
Netherlands Institute of Registered Accountants ("NIVRA"). The Parties
shall within two weeks after such appointment submit the Closing
Balance Sheet and statements of their respective positions in writing to the
Accountant. The Accountant shall determine the further procedural rules in
his discretion.  The Parties undertake to procure that the Accountant shall
then finally resolve the Open Issues by way of a binding advice ("bindend
advies") in accordance with this Agreement and that the Accountant shall
notify the Parties of his decision, inter alia certifying the amounts of the
Net Working Capital and the Net Outstanding Indebtedness which he has
established, as promptly as possible and in any event no later than eight
weeks after his appointment. The fees and expenses arising out of the
engagement of the Accountant shall be borne by the party which has on
balance been put in the wrong or otherwise as allocated by the Accountant in
his discretion.  The failure of either the Seller or the Purchaser to timely
submit to the Accountant a written statement of its position or to otherwise
fail to respond to any request of the Accountant for information shall not
preclude or delay the Accountant\'s determination of the Open Issues on the
basis of the information which will have been submitted.  The Parties
shall, and the Purchaser shall procure that the Company shall, give all
information and assistance to the Accountant requested by the Accountant for
the preparation of his binding advice. Simultaneously with providing such
information to the Accountant, the Parties shall provide each other with the
same information.  4.5 Payment of the Adjustment  At the latest within
five (5) days after the Net Working Capital and the Net Outstanding
Indebtedness have been established by the Parties pursuant to Article 4.3 or,
in the event of disputes, pursuant to Article 4.4 or 14.2, the Purchaser
shall, if the Increase Amount as referred to in Article 4.2, is higher than
the Reduction Amount as referred to in Article 4.1 pay the amount of such
difference to the Seller (on a "euro for euro" basis, converted into US
dollars in accordance with Article 4.6) by transferring such amount to a bank
account to be designated by the Seller in writing, or, if the Reduction
Amount as referred to in Article 4.1 is higher than the Increase Amount as
referred to in Article 4.2, the Seller shall pay the amount of such
difference to the Purchaser (on a "euro for euro" basis, converted into
US dollars in accordance with article 4.6) by transferring such amount to a
bank account to be designated by the Purchaser to the Seller in writing. Any
payment to be made pursuant to this Article 4.5 shall be increased by an
interest of 5% per annum accrued on such amount as from Closing until payment
of such amount.  4.6 Conversion US dollars - Euro  The conversion from
Euro into US dollars as provided for in Article 4.5 shall be made on the
basis of the European Central Bank fixing on the Closing Date.  ARTICLE 5
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  5.1 Seller\'s Representations and
Warranties  The Seller represents and warrants to the Purchaser that each
of the Seller\'s Representations and Warranties is true and accurate as at
the date of this Agreement, save to the extent any disclosures
("Disclosures") have fairly been made in the Due Diligence Information, in
the Disclosure Letter or in this Agreement, and will be true and accurate as
at Closing.  For the purpose of this Clause 5.1 any disclosures shall be
deemed to have "fairly" been made if the Purchaser, by taking prima
facie knowledge of the facts or circumstances so disclosed, could reasonably
be expected to have had awareness of such facts or circumstances constituting
a breach of the Seller\'s Representations and Warranties.  5.2 Purchaser\'s
Representations and Warranties  The Purchaser represents and warrants to the
Seller that each of the Purchaser\'s Representations and Warranties is true
and accurate as at the date of this Agreement and will be true and accurate
as at Closing.  ARTICLE 6 INDEMNIFICATION AND SURVIVAL  6.1
Indemnification  Subject to Articles 6.2 through 6.9, the Seller hereby
agrees that in case of a breach by the Seller of any of the
Seller\'s Representations and Warranties or of any of the Seller\'s
covenants or other obligations contained in this Agreement (collectively
a "Breach"), it shall indemnify the Purchaser for and hold the Purchaser
harmless against any direct damage (including reasonable costs and expenses
including attorneys fees but excluding lost profits and consequential damage)
incurred by the Purchaser and/or the Company\'s Group as a result of any such
Breach (the "Indemnification Amount") except to the extent the amounts
thereof have already been taken into account in establishing the
Purchase Price in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 (i.e. led to a
reduction in the Provisional Purchase Price), or, as the case may be,
have been indemnified to the Purchaser and/or any member of the Company\'s
Group under Article 7.2, in which case the Seller shall have no such
obligation to indemnify the Purchaser or hold the Purchaser harmless for such
amounts which have already thus been taken into account, or indemnified. The
Purchaser shall, and the Purchaser shall cause the Company\'s Group to,
mitigate the amount of any damage to the best of their ability.  Subject to
Articles 6.2 and 6.8, the Purchaser hereby agrees that in case of a breach by
the Purchaser of any of the Purchaser\'s Representations and Warranties or of
any of the Purchaser\'s covenants or other obligations contained in this
Agreement, it shall indemnify the Seller for and hold the Seller
harmless against any direct damage (including reasonable costs and
expenses and including attorneys fees but excluding lost profits
and consequential damage) incurred by the Seller and/or any of its group
companies (other than the Company\'s Group) as a result of any such breach.
The Seller shall, and the Seller shall cause any group company of the Seller
(excluding the Company\'s Group after the Closing occurs) to, mitigate the
amount of any damage to the best of their ability.  Any payment pursuant to
this Clause 6.1 shall be considered to take place as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing,
the obligations of the Seller and the obligations of the Purchaser pursuant
to Article 7.2 hereof are not governed by Articles 6.1 through 6.7.  6.2
Survival of the Seller\'s Representations and Warranties  With the exception
of the Seller\'s Representations and Warranties set forth in Sections 4 and 5
of Schedule 4 (i), which shall survive the Closing Date for the applicable
statute of limitations period, the Purchaser shall not be entitled to claim
any Indemnification Amount:  (i) relating to the Seller\'s Representations
and Warranties  set forth in Section 11 of Schedule 4 (i),upon expiry  of
the applicable statute of limitations or assessment  period under applicable
Tax laws, plus three (3)  months;  (ii) relating to the Pre-Closing
Covenants, referred to in  Article 7 hereof, upon expiry of six (6) months
from  the Closing Date; and  (iii) relating to all other the Seller\'s 
Representations and Warranties upon expiry of eighteen  (18) months from the
Closing Date,  and the Seller shall not be entitled to make any claim
relating to the Purchaser\'s Representations and Warranties upon expiry
of eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date,  all of the foregoing unless
prior to the relevant dates legal proceedings have been commenced pursuant to
Article 14 or notice of a claim and/or of either Party\'s intention to
commence legal proceedings has been served upon the other Party in
compliance with the notice provision contained in Article 13.  6.3
Purchaser\'s Investigation and Awareness  6.3.1 Subject always and without
prejudice to Articles 5.1  and 6.3.2, the fact in itself that the Purchaser
has carried  out an investigation into the Company\'s Group shall not 
prejudice any claim by the Purchaser under the Seller\'s  Representations and
Warranties or reduce any amount  recoverable thereunder.  6.3.2 The
Purchaser hereby warrants to the Seller that it has  no actual awareness upon
signing of this Agreement of any  breach of the Seller\'s Representations and
Warranties (as  such Representations and Warranties are qualified by the 
Disclosure Letter and its annexes). If any of the Purchaser  and the persons
involved in the due diligence investigation  on its behalf have any such
actual awareness, the Purchaser  will have no claim for any breach of the
Seller\'s  Representations and Warranties to which such actual  awareness
relates.  6.4 Limitation of Indemnification Amount under the Seller\'s 
Representations and Warranties  In no case shall the Seller be liable for
the payment of any Indemnification Amount under the Seller\'s Representations
and Warranties insofar as the aggregate of all such Indemnification Amounts
exceeds US$ 125 million (one hundred and twenty five million US dollars).
This limitation is not applicable, for the avoidance of doubt, to any
adjustment of the Provisional Purchase Price pursuant to Article 4.  6.5
Threshold  The Seller shall be under no liability in respect of any claim
for the payment of an Indemnification Amount under the
Seller\'s Representations and Warranties unless:  (a) the amount of any
single claim shall equal or exceed Euro  50,000 (fifty thousand Euro);
and  (b) the aggregate amount of all such single claims of Euro 50,000  or
more shall exceed Euro 2,500,000 (two million and five  hundred thousand
Euro), in which case the Seller shall merely  be liable for the excess over
the said amount of Euro  2,500,000.  These limitations are not applicable,
for the avoidance of doubt, to any adjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant
to Article 4.  6.6 Effects of Taxes, Insurances and Provisions  In
determining any Indemnification Amount and in determining whether the
threshold set forth in Article 6.5 has been exceeded, such amount shall be
reduced:  (i) by the positive effect, if any, of   (a) insurance
recoveries, provided that such recoveries  have been received in connection
with the same fact or  facts which gives or give rise to the claim for the 
Indemnification Amount; and   \t(b) Tax refunds or reductions actually
received, provided  that such Tax refunds or reductions are caused by the 
same fact or facts which gives or give rise to the  claim for the
Indemnification Amount and provided  further that there will be no such
reduction of any  Indemnification Amount to the extent that receipt of  such
Indemnification Amount would be taxable income for  the Purchaser; and  
\t(c) 50% of the benefit realised by the Purchaser or the  Company\'s Group
by use of Tax losses of the Company\'s  Group originating from the period
prior to Closing  carried forward;  (ii) by the amount of any provisions or
reserves that have been  established in the Pro Forma Accounts with respect
to the  matter for which an Indemnification Amount is claimed.  6.7 Change
of law  The Seller shall not be liable for any claim based on an
alleged Breach of the Seller\'s Representations and Warranties
asserted pursuant to this Agreement to the extent that such claim would
not have arisen but for (i) any change in law entering into force after
Closing, whether or not such change purports to be effective retroactively in
whole or in part or (ii) any interpretation of any law that was in existence
as of the Closing Date by a court or other public authority in a judgment or
decision published after Closing to the extent such interpretation is
materially different from interpretations in effect as of Closing.  6.8
Information of Claim  If either party ("Indemnitee") becomes aware of any
fact or event on the basis of which it will or may make a claim against
the other party ("Indemnitor") for the payment of any indemnification under
this Article 6, the Indemnitee shall as promptly as practicable thereafter
notify the Indemnitor thereof in writing giving reasonable particulars of the
facts that give rise to such claim or potential claim and specifying if
possible the Indemnitee\'s best reasonable estimate of the likely amount of
the claim or potential claim. Any failure or delay of the Indemnitee to give
such notice to the Indemnitor shall not prejudice the right of the Indemnitee
to make any claims for indemnification under this Article 6 but shall reduce
the claimed amount by the amount of damage attributable to such failure or
delay.  6.9 Defence against Third Party Claims  Where a claim or potential
claim of the Purchaser for an Indemnification Amount is based upon or related
to a Third Party Claim, the Purchaser shall notify the Seller thereof in
writing in accordance with Article 6.8 and as soon as possible following
the date of the said notification the Parties shall consult on the course of
action to be taken. Without prejudice to the Purchaser\'s right to claim any
Indemnification Amount the Seller shall, at its own cost and expense, be
entitled to assume the defence of the Third Party Claim, to employ its own
counsel (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser) and
to take such action as may be necessary to avoid, dispute, resist, appeal,
or compromise such claim, any of the aforementioned if applicable in the
name of the company of the Company\'s Group which is the subject of the
claim; provided that the Purchaser shall be entitled to have sole control
over the defence or settlement of any Third Party claim to the extent that
such claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief against the
Purchaser which, if successful, would be reasonably likely to
materially interfere with the business, operations, assets, or
financial condition of the Purchaser, the Company\'s Group or the
Industrial Packaging Division. The Seller shall promptly notify the
Purchaser if it so elects to assume the defence of the Third Party
Claim.  If the Seller elects not to assume the defence or, following notice
from the Purchaser to make an election, does not make any election, the
Purchaser shall be entitled to assume the defence of the Third Party Claim in
its own discretion provided that the Purchaser or the Company\'s Group shall
not compromise any such claim without the prior written consent of the
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event
the Seller assumes the defence of a Third Party Claim, the Purchaser will
co-operate in good faith with the Seller in such defence and will have the
right to participate in the defence of any Third Party Claim assisted by
counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the named parties to the Third Party Claim (including any
impleaded parties) include both the Seller and the Purchaser or if
the Seller proposes that the same counsel represent both the Purchaser and
the Seller and the Purchaser in good faith determines that representation of
both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential differing interests between them, then the Purchaser shall
have the right to retain its own counsel at the cost and expense of the
Seller.  If the defence of a Third Party Claim is conducted by the
Seller, and the Seller and the relevant third party wish to compromise
the Third Party Claim in a cash settlement while the Purchaser and/or the
relevant company of the Company\'s Group do not consent to such compromise or
refuse to co-operate in carrying out such compromise, then the Seller\'s
liability to pay any Indemnification Amount shall in respect of such Third
Party Claim be limited to the amount offered in such compromise.  The
Seller will co-operate with the Purchaser, and the Purchaser will and will
cause the Company\'s Group to co-operate with the Seller, in resolving or
attempting to resolve any Third Party Claim including permitting the other
Party access to all books and records of the Company\'s Group which might be
useful for such purpose, during normal business hours and at the place where
the same are normally kept, with full right to make copies thereof or take
extracts therefrom at the cost of the requesting Party, except to the extent
that such disclosure would violate any agreement, law or court order. Such
books and records shall be subject to a duty of confidentiality for each
Party except to the extent that it is necessary to disclose information
contained therein in the course of the proceedings resolving such
Third Party Claim or as otherwise required to be disclosed by applicable law
or stock exchange rules.  6.10 Officers and Directors of the Company\'s
Group  The Seller confirms that it will not, after the Closing, claim from
any officer or employee of the Company\'s Group who was, prior to the
Closing, an officer or employee of the Seller or its subsidiaries (including,
but not limited to, the Company and the Subsidiaries), any damages and/or
losses incurred by the Seller as a result of a breach of the Seller\'s
Representations and Warranties or as a result of the environmental indemnity
as set out in Clause 6.11 or the indemnity as set out in Article 7.2 on the
basis that the information provided by said officer or employee was
inaccurate, incorrect or incomplete; provided that the Seller may take action
against such officer or employee (but not against the Purchaser or the
Company\'s Group) in case of an act of fraud ("bedrog") or gross negligence
("grove schuld") on the part of such officer or employee.  6.11

terms and expressions in this  Article 6.11 are defined terms and expressions

maintaining and  operating manufacturing  equipment, renewal of 
Environmental Permits,  management and/or  removal of asbestos  containing
materials  that are an integral  part of building  materials maintained
in  good condition on any  Property, and meeting  emission requirements
in  Environmental Permits.  Environmental Disclosure Letter: the letter of
even date  with this Agreement from  the Seller to the  Purchaser, attached
as  Schedule 21, containing  disclosures under the  representations and 
warranties of the Seller  stated in Article  6.11.12 of this 
Agreement  Environmental Insurance Policy: the insurance policy  referred
to in Article  6.11.3  Environmental Laws: has the meaning given in 
Article 1.1  Environmental Matter(s): all matters involving,  concerning,
arising out  of, or relating to (i)  the compliance with or  violation of
the  Environmental Laws by  the Seller or the  Company\'s Group prior to 
or on the Closing Date  and/or (ii) the  environmental conditions  existing
at and/or  pollutants present at,  on or under any Property  prior to or on
the  Closing Date, which  could cause  Environmental Costs. For  avoidance
of doubt,  Environmental Matters  includes, but is not  limited to, third
party  claims in relation to  the foregoing  Environmental Permits: all
EU, national,  federal, provincial and  municipal permits,  licences,
exemptions,  consents or  authorisations howsoever  named, including but
not  limited to equivalent or  similar governmental  items in any

that is  transferred to the  Purchaser or the  Purchaser\'s Group upon 
Closing  the Purchaser\'s Group: the Purchaser and all its  group companies
including  the Company\'s group  Self Insured Retention Amount: that
amount of payment  that must be expended by  the Parties before  payments
or  reimbursements will be  made by the insurer(s)  for matters covered 
under the Environmental  Insurance Policy, as  defined in Article  6.11.3,
which amount  shall be US$ 50 million.   6.11.2 Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement  and to the exclusion of any responsibility
or liability of  any party in respect of Environmental Matters and to the 
exclusion of any limitations or reductions of  responsibility or liability of
any party in respect of  Environmental Matters, in any other provision in
this  Agreement, the provisions of this Article 6.11 shall  govern and
control the obligations, liabilities and  responsibilities of the Parties
with respect to any  Environmental Matter; provided, however, that Article 
6.6.(i)(a) and Article 6.10 shall apply to this Article  6.11 and further
provided that, if an amount can be claimed  under several provisions of this
Agreement, such amount  shall not be reimbursed more than once.  6.11.3 The
Seller and the Purchaser shall cause to be purchased  an environmental
insurance policy to be issued on the date  of Closing and to be effective as
of the Closing Date from  one or more insurers reasonably acceptable to the
Seller  and the Purchaser covering certain environmental risks and 
liabilities as the Parties shall agree between signing of  this Agreement and
Closing (the "Environmental Insurance  Policy") on terms and conditions as
shall be acceptable to  the Purchaser and the Seller. The total premium cost
under  the Environmental Insurance Policy shall be paid by and be  for the
account of the Purchaser and shall not exceed US$  10 million. If the total
premium cost under the  Environmental Insurance Policy were to exceed US$
10  million, the Purchaser shall be entitled to refuse to  purchase the
Environmental Insurance Policy on the basis of  such higher premium and to
refuse to proceed to Closing,  unless the Seller accepts a reduction of the
Purchase Price  equal to the amount with which the total premium cost under 
the Environmental Insurance Policy exceeds US$ 10 million.  If the Seller
accepts such reduction of the Purchase Price,  the total premium cost under
the Environmental Insurance  Policy including the excess, will be paid by and
be for the  account of the Purchaser. The Seller and the Purchaser  agree to
seek cost cap coverage for the excluded conditions  on or at the Lier 1 and 2
sites and some of the other sites  referred to on Schedule 24 referenced in
Article 6.11.6  below as part of the environmental insurance
coverage.  6.11.4 Subject to Articles 6.11.5 through 6.11.10 and Articles 
6.11.13, 6.11.14 and 6.11.15 below, the Seller shall  reimburse the Purchaser
an amount equal to the Seller\'s  share (as determined in accordance with
Articles 6.11.5 and  6.11.6 respectively) of the Environmental Costs for
any  Environmental Matters, including, without limitation, any 
Environmental Matters among the matters disclosed in the  Environmental
Disclosure Letter. Reimbursement by the Seller  to the Purchaser shall be
made within thirty (30) days after  written notice to the Seller of the
reimbursement amount,  provided that prior to or with such notice the Seller
has  been provided with documentation reasonably sufficient for  the Seller
to evaluate the Environmental Matter and review  in reasonable detail the
Environmental Costs for which  reimbursement is being sought.  6.11.5 With
respect to the payment of any Environmental Cost for  any Environmental
Matter that qualifies to apply against the  Self-Insured Retention Amount,
any and all payments therefor  shall be shared by the Purchaser being
responsible for 30%  of the amount of any such payment and by the Seller 
reimbursing the Purchaser in a timely manner of 70% of the  amount of any
such payment.  6.11.6 With respect to the payment of any Environmental
Costs  for any Environmental Matters not paid under the  Environmental
Insurance Policy and not qualifying to apply  against the Self-Insured
Retention Amount, including  without limitation those known matters excluded
from  coverage under the Environmental Insurance Policy as listed  on
Schedule 24, any and all payments therefor shall be  shared by the Parties
and allocated as follows:  (a) the Purchaser shall have made such payments
therefor  until such payments by the Purchaser total US$ 10  million;
provided that such Purchaser\'s responsibility  to pay US$ 10 million shall
be limited to Environmental  Costs for Environmental Matters listed on
Schedule 24;  and  (b) as to Environmental Costs for Environmental
Matters  listed on Schedule 24 in excess of the Purchaser\'s  obligation in
Article 6.11.6 (a) above and as to all  other matters under this Article
6.11.6:  (i) the Purchaser shall be responsible for 30% of the  amount of
any such payments; and  (ii) the Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser in a 
timely manner for 70% of the amount of any such  payments.  6.11.7 In any
dispute resolution with any insurer as to  whether any Environmental Cost
shall be applied against the  Self-Insured Retention Amount or paid for under
the  Environmental Insurance Policy, the Purchaser shall confer  with the
Seller regarding the strategy for and steps to be  taken in such dispute
resolution and the Seller\'s approval  shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; provided  that, if the Seller fails to provide its approval, the 
Purchaser may at its election proceed with such dispute  resolution in the
Purchaser\'s sole discretion and/or seek  dispute resolution under this
Agreement regarding the  reasonableness of the Seller\'s failure or refusal
to grant  approval and any related matters. The Purchaser\'s separate 
pursuit of dispute resolutions with the insurer(s) shall not  prejudice the
Seller\'s right to dispute the same issue with  the Purchaser provided that
the Seller provides the  Purchaser with a written statement of the grounds
for such  position.  6.11.8\t(A) The Purchaser shall not be entitled to
claim under  this Article 6.11\tto the extent that such claim would not
have  arisen but for, results from or is increased by:  (i) any act or
omission after the Closing Date by any  employee, contractor, agent or other
person  controlled by the Purchaser or a member of the  Purchaser\'s Group,
which act or omission  constitutes negligence or wilful misconduct; and  any
act or omission after the Closing Date by any  other person, other than an
employee, agent,  contractor, or other person under the control of  the
Seller, which act or omission constitutes  gross negligence or wilful
misconduct;  (ii) any Environmental Cost that is not approved by the 
Seller or excepted from approval as provided in  Article 6.11.10
below;  (iii) development construction, demolition, or  expansion of any
Property after the Closing Date  by the Purchaser\'s Group ("Development")
except  for Development in relation to a use of the  relevant Property which
is substantially the same  as, or an extension of, the business carried on
at  that Property as at the Closing Date;  (iv) loss of profits, loss of
sales, loss of  production, business interruption, or any other  indirect or
consequential loss or damage or  internal cost;  (v) any pollution or
contamination first existing or  arising after the Closing Date; provided,
for the  avoidance of doubt, that contamination or  pollution consisting of
migration of pollutants  that were present at, on or under the Property 
prior to or at Closing Date shall be an  Environmental Matter
hereunder;  (vi) any indemnity, covenant, undertaking, warranty,  assurance
or other contractual provision entered  into or given by any member of the
Purchaser\'s  Group on or after the Closing Date;  (vii) the Purchaser\'s
failure to comply with Article  6.11.9; or  (viii) changes in Environmental
Laws or Environmental  Laws established after the Closing Date only as  they
apply to claims under Articles 6.11.6 and  6.11.12, but not as to claims
under Article  6.11.5.  (B) Any relief from liability of the Seller as a
result of  an event described in Article 6.11.8(A)(i), (ii),  (iii), (v),
(vi),(vii) or (viii) above, shall be only  to the extent that prejudice to
the Seller is  reasonably quantifiable and is not immaterial;  (C)
Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary  but without prejudice to
Article 6.11.9 (C) (i), the  Purchaser and any member of the Purchaser\'s
Group may  conduct any Investigation at any time at any location  or
Property without notice to or approval by the  Seller (provided that the
Seller\'s obligation to share  the cost of Investigations applies only to 
Investigations that result in the incurrence of other  Environmental Costs
that must be reimbursed by the  Seller to the Purchaser under this Article
6.11);  (D) The Purchaser shall not be entitled to claim under this 
Article 6.11 to the extent that such claim is increased  by the Purchaser or
the Purchaser\'s Group or their  respective employees, agents and
contractors, incurring  Environmental Costs which would otherwise be 
reimbursable under this Article 6.11 but which exceed a  minimum level of
Environmental Costs. Minimum level of  Environmental Costs is intended to
mean such  reasonable Environmental Costs that are incurred in  exercising
reasonable and professional judgment, from  time to time, under all the
relevant facts and  circumstances known at the various times, regarding 
decisions that are made with respect to both the  determination of the steps
or actions reasonably  necessary to address the relevant Environmental
Matter  and the incurrence of reasonable Environmental Costs .  6.11.9 The
Purchaser shall ensure that, in relation to any  Environmental Matter:  (A)
the Seller shall be notified as soon as reasonably  practicable in writing if
the Purchaser or any member  of the Purchaser\'s Group becomes aware that a 
particular Environmental Matter exists provided that  the Environmental
Matters listed on Schedule 24  referenced in Article 6.11.6 or reported in
the  Environmental Disclosure Letter, other than significant  changes in
relation thereto after the Closing Date,  shall be deemed to have been
notified under this sub-  article as at the date of this Agreement;  (B)
the Seller shall be notified as soon as reasonably  practicable in writing
upon any person initiating any  substantial written contact with the
Purchaser or any  member of the Purchaser\'s Group, making or threatening 
any claim based on an Environmental Matter; the Parties  acknowledge that
management of the facilities is  decentralized and , in exercising its best
efforts  within this management context, notice of Environmental  Matters
under this Article 6.11.9 may take longer than  in other management
contexts;  (C) Each member of the Purchaser\'s Group shall take  reasonable
steps to:  (i) allow the Seller (and/or its advisers) to attend  and
inspect the carrying out of any Investigation  or any other activities of the
Purchaser which  involve the incurrence of an Environmental Cost,  other
than Investigations in the ordinary course  of business, at any time whilst
it is being  carried out subject to the notice provisions  above;  (ii)
promptly provide to the Seller all relevant non-  privileged correspondence,
documents or  information which are or come into the possession  of such
member of the Purchaser\'s Group in  relation to such Environmental Matters,
except  Investigations in the ordinary course of business,  and promptly
provide a status report to the Seller  as and when the Seller shall
reasonably require;  and  (iii) allow the Seller (and/or its advisers) to
attend  and participate in any site visit or other meeting  as the Seller
shall reasonably require on  reasonable notice in relation to such 
Environmental Matters.  (iv) allow the Seller, and its agents and
contractors,  reason-able access to conduct a reasonable scope  of Investi-
gation on any Property which is then in  the custody and control of the
Purchaser, provided  that the Purchaser can place reasonable conditions  on
the time and scope of Investigation so as to  not unreasonably interfere with
or disrupt  operations, or place the Purchaser at risk of  violating any
Environmental Laws, Environmental  Permits, or contracts, or create any
safety,  health or environmental risk, and provided that  the Seller shall
promptly provide the Purchaser  with test results and reports, other than 
privileged information;  (v) the Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless
the  Purchaser and the Purchaser\'s Group from any  claim, damage or
liability, including reasonable  legal fees and expense for defence of
claims, to  the extent caused by the activities of the Seller  and its
agents and contractors in exercising the  Seller\'s rights under this Article
6.11.9 (C) (i),  (iii) and (iv);  (D) in giving notice under this Article
6.11, the Purchaser  shall give to the Seller reasonable particulars of the 
facts of the Environmental Matters and specifying, if  possible, the
Purchaser\'s best reasonable estimate of  the likely amount of any
claim.  6.11.10\tThe Purchaser shall not be entitled to any claim 
whatsoever under Article 6.11.6 unless the Purchaser has  obtained the
Seller\'s approval as provided in this Article  6.11.10, or would reasonably
be entitled to such approval  under all relevant factors and
circumstances:  (A) with respect to Environmental Costs for Environmental 
Matters that result from the order, directive,  instruction, or injunction of
an Environmental  Authority or third party claims in litigation, the 
Purchaser or the Purchaser\'s Group shall, except as  otherwise provided for
in this Article 6.11.10,  vigorously defend against such Environmental 
Authority\'s action and shall not enter into any  agreement, concession,
settlement, or admission which  is material in relation to such
Environmental  Authority\'s action or the defence thereof (including  any
failure to appeal or decision not to appeal such  Environmental Authority\'s
action) without the prior  written approval of the Seller, which approval
shall  not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In defending  an order,
directive, instruction, or injunction of an  Environmental Authority or any
litigated third party  claim, the Purchaser or the Purchaser\'s Group will 
consult with the Seller on the course of action to be  taken including
reasonable steps to avoid, dispute,  resist, appeal or compromise each
matter; provided that  the Purchaser and the Purchaser\'s Group shall 
consistent with the rights of the Seller as stated in  this Article 6.11.10
(A) retain sole control over the  defence or settlement of any such matter.
The word  "consult" in the prior sentence shall mean that the  Purchaser
will co-operate with the Seller regarding the  Seller\'s rights under Article
6.11.9 (C) and in good  faith reasonably confer with and consider Seller\'s 
input while retaining the right to make final decisions  on strategy, defence
and settlement. If the Purchaser  proceeds without the Seller\'s approval, it
is without  prejudice to the Seller\'s right to dispute whether or  the
extent to which it must reimburse the Purchaser  under Article 6.11.6
provided that the Seller provides  the Purchaser with a written statement of
the grounds  for its failure or refusal of approval;  (B) with respect to
other Environmental Costs for  Environmental Matters that fall within Article
6.11.6,  the Purchaser or the Purchaser\'s Group will, except as  otherwise
provided for in this Article 6.11.10,  endeavour to obtain the prior written
approval of the  Seller under the criteria in Article 6.11.10 (D), such 
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed;  (C) the Purchaser or
any member of the Purchaser\'s Group  may incur Environmental Costs for
Environmental Matters  prior to obtaining the Seller\'s approval without 
prejudice to the Seller\'s obligation to share in the  cost to the extent if
in the Purchaser\'s reasonable  judgement after careful and professional
consideration  such work should be promptly commenced and should not  be
delayed by the notice and approval process, in order  to comply with or avoid
violation of an Environmental  Permit or an instruction or requirement of
an  Environmental Authority acting within its apparent  authority, to
contain or mitigate contamination that  poses an immediate and substantial
risk to human health  or the environment or, if action were delayed, the 
likely result would be a significant increase in  Environmental Cost
otherwise to be reimbursed under  Article 6.11.6;  (D) in exercising its
rights to approve Environmental Costs  for Environmental Matters as provided
in Article  6.11.10(B), the Seller acknowledges and agrees that it  may be
desirable, appropriate and reasonable for the  Purchaser and members of the
Purchaser`s Group to incur  Environmental Costs, which would be subject to
cost  sharing hereunder, under voluntary action programs of  Environmental
Authorities, to address substantial risks  to human health or the
environment, to contain or  mitigate contamination or pollution that, if
action  were delayed or denied, would likely result in  substantially
increased Environmental Costs otherwise  to be reimbursed under Article
6.11.6 or violation of  Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits, and to 
comply with Van Leer Corporate Environmental Policy in  effect on the Closing
Date, a copy of which is attached  as Schedule 25 even without an order,
directive,  instruction or injunction of an Environmental  Authority, and
such circumstances may be the basis for  approval of such Environmental Costs
subject to cost  sharing herein;  (E) the Purchaser or the Purchaser\'s
Group may obtain the  Seller\'s approval in accordance with this Article 
6.11.10 for Environmental Costs when (i) it is in doubt  whether, or (ii) the
insurer(s) have yet to acknowledge  that, such Environmental Costs are
qualifying for  application against the Self-Insured Retention Amount  and
/or for payment or reimbursement under the  Environmental Insurance
Policy.  6.11.11\tAny real estate, facility, site, leased premise,
occupied  premise, premise used or included in any contractual 
relationship, transport or operation of the Company\'s Group  or the
Industrial Products Division transferred to a third  party, transferred to or
retained by the Seller or the  Consumer Packaging Division, or whose use
ended (except for  Property) during the period of time up to and including
the  Closing Date, shall be deemed as an Excluded Asset and all  liabilities
and costs including but not limited to  Environmental Costs arising out of or
relating thereto  shall be governed by the indemnity in the third paragraph 
of Article 7.2 of this Agreement.  6.11.12\tExcept as fairly disclosed in
the Environmental  Disclosure Letter, the Seller makes the following 
representations and warranties in regard to this Article  6.11 of the
Agreement, all of which shall be renewed at and  shall survive the Closing,
and the Seller shall indemnify,  defend, and hold harmless the Purchaser from
any  Environmental Cost not otherwise paid or reimbursed to the  Purchaser
under the Environmental Insurance Policy  involving, concerning, arising out
of, or relating to any  breach of these representations and
warranties:  (A) to the knowledge of the Seller, neither the Company nor 
its Subsidiaries have provided to any third party any  indemnity relating to
any Environmental Matter that could  cause any Environmental Cost for the
Company or any of  the Subsidiaries;  (B) the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has obtained  all Environmental Permits necessary to operate
each of  its facilities other than Environmental Permits the  absence of
which do not, individually or collectively,  have material adverse
consequences for the Company\'s  Group taken as a whole; such Environmental
Permits are in  full force and effect; and the Company and each of its 
Subsidiaries has at all times conducted its operations in  compliance with
such Environmental Permits, except for  violations which individually or
collectively do not have  a material adverse consequence for the Company\'s
Group  taken as a whole;  (C) to the knowledge of the Seller, the Company
and each of  its Subsidiaries is in substantial compliance with the 
Environmental Laws, except for violations which  individually or collectively
do not have a material  adverse consequence for the Company\'s Group taken as
a  whole;  (D) there is no pending litigation or administrative 
adjudacatory proceeding against the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries
relating to any Environmental Matter that  could cause material Environmental
Costs;  (E) the Seller has no knowledge of criminal or civil  actions for,
notice-of-violation, or summons to, or  court, regulatory or administrative
adjudacatory  proceeding against, the Company or any Subsidiary  relating to
a violation of any of the Environmental Laws  or any Environmental Matter
that could cause any  Environmental Costs; and except for such actions, 
notices, summonses or proceedings which individually or  collectively do not
have a material adverse consequence  for the Company\'s Group taken as a
whole, no such actions  or proceedings exist;  (F) there exists no
Environmental Matter caused by nor any  violation by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of  any of the Environmental Laws and, to the knowledge of 
the Seller, there exists no Environmental Matter nor  violation of
Environmental Laws by any third party, that  (i) could disrupt the operations
of any facility of the  Company or any Subsidiary and (ii) has material
adverse  consequences for the Company\'s Group taken as a whole;  and  (G)
[note: intent is to draft language around provisions in  insurance policy and
applications, which language is to  be agreed prior to Closing with reference
to the  Environmental Insurance Policy and applications].2  For the
avoidance of doubt, the Seller\'s liability to the Purchaser under this
Article 6.11.12 shall not be subject to the provisions of Articles 6.1
through 6.9., except for Article 6.6(i)(a). For purposes of Article
6.11.12, knowledge shall have the meaning in Schedule 4 (i).  2-Warranty to
deal with the provision of information to the insurers  Claims under Article
6.11.12 (B) , (C), (D), (E) and (F) shall be subject to cost sharing with the
Purchaser being responsible for 30% and the Seller being responsible for
70% of the amount of each such claim. Claims under Article 6.11.12 (A) and
(G) shall not be subject to cost sharing and the Seller shall be responsible
for each entire claim.  6.11.13\tThe Purchaser shall not be entitled to
claim against  the Seller under this Article 6.11 unless the Seller has 
been given notice of such claim under this Article 6.11 on  or before the
10th annual anniversary date of the Closing  Date. For avoidance of doubt,
for any claims under Article  6.11 properly noticed within such ten (10) year
period ,  Environmental Costs and other damages and expenses may be 
recovered from the Seller even though incurred after the  10th annual
anniversary of the Closing Date, provided legal  proceedings under Article
14.2 have been commenced by the  Purchaser against the Seller with regard to
such claim  within six (6) months after the 10th annual anniversary 
date.  6.11.14\tNo claims by the Purchaser under Article 6.11 shall be 
made against the Seller unless such claim is in excess of  US$ 5,000 for all
amounts caused by the same fact or facts,  provided that, once the US$ 5,000
threshold has been  satisfied, then all qualified Environmental Costs shall
be  subject to reimbursement as provided in Article 6.11. Such  minimum
amount for claims shall also apply when claims are  to be taken into account
for the purpose of determining  whether the US$ 10 million limit referred to
in Article  6.11.6 has been reached.  6.11.15\tIn determining the
Environmental Costs for the purposes  of reimbursement under Article 6.11
such amounts shall be  reduced by the positive effect, if any, of Tax refunds
or  reductions actually received, provided that such Tax refunds  or
reductions are caused by the same fact or facts which  gives or give rise to
the claim in relation to the  Environmental Costs and provided further that
there will be  no such reduction of any Environmental Costs to the extent 
that receipt of any reimbursement for such Environmental  Costs would be
taxable income for the Purchaser.  ARTICLE 7 PRE-CLOSING COVENANTS  7.1
Conduct of Business  The Seller agrees and will take measures to ensure that
until the Closing Date the Company and/or any of the Subsidiaries will
not without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, in so far as the
Industrial Packaging Division is concerned:  (i) enter into any material
agreement or assume any material  obligation or liability relating to their
assets, their  business and/or their financial condition other than in the 
ordinary course of business as the same has been conducted  prior to the date
of this Agreement;  (ii) enter into any transaction or take any action
which, if  effected or performed prior to the date of this Agreement,  would
constitute a material breach of the Seller\'s  Representations and
Warranties; whereby for the purpose of  this Article 7.1 "material" should be
interpreted taking into  account the Company\'s Group as a whole; or  (iii)
enter into any transaction or take any action that  would result in or create
a redundancy or severance liability  or obligation for the Company or the
Subsidiaries that is not  satisfied in full prior to the Closing except in
the ordinary  course of business and except with the prior written consent 
of the Purchaser; provided however if any litigation ensues  regarding such
liability or obligation and is not resolved  with all redundancy or severance
amounts and related legal  and other costs paid prior to the Closing, the
Seller shall  indemnify the Purchaser and hold the Purchaser harmless 
against any direct damage (including reasonable costs and  expenses including
attorneys fees but excluding lost profits  and consequential damages)
incurred by the Purchaser and/or  the Company\'s Group as the result of the
foregoing.  Any agreement, obligation, liability, transaction or
action relating to the direct or indirect transfer of the Consumer Packaging
Division and the Excluded Assets by the Company to the Seller or any group
company of the Seller (other than the Company\'s Group) and/or relating to
the transfer of the Included Assets and Subsidiary Shares not yet held by the
Company\'s Group into the Company\'s Group is explicitly excluded from this
Article 7.1.  7.2 Reorganisation  Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall
cause the following actions to be taken (collectively, the
"Reorganisation"):  (a) cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to contribute
and  transfer to other legal entities owned or controlled by the  Seller
(other than entities within the Company\'s Group) all  right, title and
interest in and to any and all Excluded  Assets, whether tangible or
intangible and whether fixed,  contingent or otherwise, including but not
limited to all  of the capital stock of the Company\'s subsidiaries that
are  not Subsidiaries, to the extent that any of the foregoing  is not held
legally and beneficially by such other entities  and to assume or cause such
other entities to assume any  and all liabilities included in the Excluded
Assets of  every kind whatsoever, whether absolute, known, unknown,  fixed,
contingent or otherwise; and  (b) cause the Seller and its subsidiaries,
excluding the  Company\'s Group, to contribute and transfer to the
Company\'s  Group all right, title and interest in and to any and all of 
the Included Assets, whether tangible or intangible and  whether fixed,
contingent or otherwise, and the Subsidiary  Shares, to the extent any of the
foregoing is not yet held  legally and beneficially by the Company\'s Group
and cause  the Company and the Subsidiaries to assume any and all 
liabilities included in the Included Assets of every kind  whatsoever,
whether absolute, known, unknown, fixed,  contingent or otherwise.  A
description of the Reorganisation is attached as Schedule 8 (i). The Seller
and the Purchaser will negotiate in good faith in order to reach agreement as
soon as practicable but ultimately before Closing on the details of the
implementation of the Reorganisation in the USA, France and Brazil and in
such other countries where a re-evaluation of the proposed scheme may
become desirable for both Parties. The Seller will exercise its reasonable
best efforts to cause the transfer of the Consumer Packaging Division and the
Excluded Assets by the Company or the relevant Subsidiary to other legal
entities within the group of the Seller (excluding the Company\'s Group) and
to transfer the Included Assets (including the Subsidiary Shares) not yet
held by the Company\'s Group to the Company\'s Group as described
above under (a) and (b) before the Closing Date. To the extent this shall
not have been completed on or before the Closing, the Company shall, as from
Closing, have beneficial title ("economische gerechtigdheid") to all such
Included Assets and Subsidiary Shares, legal title ("juridische
gerechtigdheid") of which has not yet been transferred to the Company\'s
Group, and the Seller shall, as from Closing, have beneficial title to
the Consumer Packaging Division and all Excluded Assets, legal title of
which has not yet been transferred by the Company or the relevant Subsidiary
to the Seller\'s group (excluding the Company\'s Group), and the Seller and
the Purchaser shall jointly co-operate to achieve the transfer of such legal
title in the most expeditious and effective manner. To that effect and to
provide for arrangements as to liabilities which are to be transferred
in accordance with this Article 7.2 but from which the transferor has not
yet been released by any relevant third party, the Parties shall on the
Closing Date sign an agreement substantially in the form as set out in
Schedule 9. 3  As from the Closing, the Seller will indemnify and keep
the Purchaser and any member of the Company\'s Group harmless from
and against any liability, costs or damages relating to or constituting any
of the Excluded Assets or resulting from the Reorganisation (other than
liabilities transferred as Included Assets pursuant to the Reorganisation),
including but not limited to any Tax liability caused by, resulting from or
attributable to the Reorganisation or the Consumer Packaging Division save
(i) for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent these amounts have been taken
into account for the establishment of the Purchase Price pursuant to Articles
3 and 4 hereof (i.e. led to a reduction of the Provisional Purchase Price) or
as a result of any claim(s) under the Seller\'s Representations and
Warranties and (ii) save in relation to the Reorganisation steps as set out
in Schedule 8 (ii). Without prejudice to the Purchaser\'s rights under
the Seller\'s Representations and Warranties and other indemnities pursuant
to this Agreement , as from the Closing, the Purchaser will indemnify and
keep the Seller and any of the members of the Seller\'s group (excluding the
Company\'s Group) harmless from and against any liability relating to or
constituting any of the Included Assets, including but not limited to any Tax
liability attributable to the Industrial Packaging Division. For
the avoidance of doubt, it is explicitly agreed that the liability of the
Seller or the Purchaser pursuant to this Clause 7.2 is not subject to the
provisions of Article 6.1 through 6.7.  The Purchaser shall procure that the
Seller, upon the Seller\'s reasonable request, shall at all times after the
Closing have access to and obtain copies of all books and records relating
to the Consumer Packaging Division.  3- The Excluded Assets shall include
the rights and obligations of the  Company of the agreement between it and
Illinois Tool Works, Inc. ("ITW")  dated as of August 7,2000 pursuant to
which the the Company sold VLF  Holding, Van Leer Flexibles N.V. and Van Leer
Flexibles (Tx) Inc. to  ITW. Seller shall cause this agreement to be assigned
to itself or a  company in the Consumer Packaging Division and use its best
efforts to  have ITW consent thereto and release the Company from any
obligations  thereunder.  7.3 Access to Information and
Properties  Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date,
the Seller will upon reasonable advance notice (i) give the Purchaser and
its authorised representatives reasonable access, during regular business
hours, to the main offices and other main facilities of the Company and the
Significant Subsidiaries used in connection with the Industrial Packaging
Division and permit the Purchaser to make such reasonable inspections of
such offices and facilities as it may require; and (ii) allow the Purchaser
and its authorised representatives reasonable access to the key management of
the Company and the Significant Subsidiaries. The Seller will cause the
Company\'s Group to fully co-operate in connection with the foregoing
activities.  7.4 Belgian Coordination Center  The Parties agree that Van
Leer Coordination Center N.V. will as at signing of this Agreement remain on
Annex 6 (i); however, the Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
transfer this company to the Consumer Packaging Division prior to Closing.
If such transfer shall not have occurred prior to Closing, the Seller shall
hold the Purchaser harmless against all costs actually incurred by the
Purchaser in connection with the closing down of this company.  7.5
Supervisory Board Van Leer Netherlands B.V.  At Purchaser\'s request, the
Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts prior to Closing to obtain the
resignations of the supervisory directors of Van Leer Netherlands
B.V..  ARTICLE 8 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT  8.1 Conditions Precedent to the

financial position of  the Company\'s Group or the Seller that the Purchaser
or the  Seller, as the case may be, should such action or proceeding  have
been taken or instituted or threatened on or before the  date hereof, would
not have entered into this Agreement on  the same or similar
conditions.  (c) the Stichting Van Leer Group Foundation (the

before the Closing Date, the Seller will undertake to cause the full
settlement of all loans to the Consumer Packaging Division from the
Company\'s Group (for a matter of reference the loans which are in the
categories "Loans to HVL consumer companies" and "Loans to HVL consumer
companies relating to separation of consumer" in note (3) of the Pro Forma
Accounts), and all loans from the Consumer Packaging Division to

Accounts) except for any such intercompany debt between the Company on the
one side and the Seller and/or Huhtamaki Finance Oy on the other side as

intercompany debt between the Company on the one side and the Seller and/or
Huhtamaki Finance Oy on the other side as referred to in the hypothetical
calculations II and III of Schedule 19.  9.3 Release of guarantees and
indemnity  The Purchaser acknowledges that the Seller will cause to
be released or withdrawn as from Closing or, in respect of statements of
joint liability issued under Article 403 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil
Code, as soon as possible thereafter, any guarantees, indemnities, letters of
comfort or Encumbrances issued or incurred by the Seller or any of its group
companies (excluding the Company\'s Group) for the benefit of any company
belonging to the Industrial Packaging Division (including any such
403 statements). The Purchaser shall, if necessary, assume or take over from
the Seller or such group company of the Seller all obligations pursuant to
any such guarantees, indemnities, letters of comfort or Encumbrances. The
Parties shall in reasonableness co-operate with each other in order to cause
the release, withdrawal or assumption, as the case may be, of any
such guarantees, indemnities, letters of comfort or Encumbrances issued or
incurred by the Seller or such group company of the Seller. Without prejudice
to the Purchaser\'s rights under the Seller\'s Representations and Warranties
and other indemnities pursuant to this Agreement, the Purchaser will
indemnify and keep the Seller and any of its group companies (excluding the
Company\'s Group) harmless from and against any liability, resulting from
such guarantees, indemnities, letters of comfort or Encumbrances for the
period preceding their release, withdrawal or assumption, as the case may be
(including but not limited to any residual liability pursuant to Article 404
of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code).  The Seller acknowledges that the
Purchaser will cause to be released or withdrawn as from Closing or, in
respect of statements of joint liability issued under Article 403 of Book 2
of the Netherlands Civil Code, as soon as possible thereafter,
any guarantees, indemnities, letters of comfort or Encumbrances issued or
incurred by the Company\'s Group for the benefit of any company belonging to
the Consumer Packaging Division (including any such 403 statements). The
Seller shall, if necessary, assume or take over from such company of the
Company\'s Group all obligations pursuant to any such guarantees,
indemnities, letters of comfort or Encumbrances. The Parties shall in
reasonableness co-operate with each other in order to cause the release,
withdrawal or assumption, as the case may be, of any such
guarantees, indemnities, letters of comfort or Encumbrances issued or
incurred by the Company\'s Group. The Seller will indemnify and keep
the Purchaser and any of the companies of the Company\'s Group harmless from
and against any liability, resulting from such guarantees, indemnities,
letters of comfort or Encumbrances for the period preceding their release,
withdrawal or assumption, as the case may be (including but not limited to
any residual liability pursuant to Article 404 of Book 2 of the Netherlands
Civil Code).  9.4 Pensions  Schedule 14 hereto lists the enterprise
pension funds in Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States of
America, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya and Zimbabwe (the "Industrial Pension
Funds") which presently provide for the pensions of (former) employees in the
Industrial Packaging Division and of (former) employees in the Consumer
Packaging Division. After the Closing the Industrial Pension Funds will
remain with the Industrial Packaging Division and after a transitional
period (the "Transitional Period") which will commence at Closing and end
ultimately on the date falling six months after the Closing Date the
Industrial Pension Funds will cease to provide for the pensions of active
employees in the Consumer Packaging Division. Furthermore, Schedule 15 lists
the active employees who are a member of the Industrial Pension Funds and who
are presently employed by the Consumer Packaging Division in Australia,
the United Kingdom, the United States of America, South Africa, Nigeria,
Kenya and Zimbabwe, hereinafter referred to as the "Consumer Employees").
Benefits which become due and payable to Consumer Employees during the
Transitional Period will be paid by the Industrial Pension Fund, and the
Seller will make contributions to the Industrial Pension Fund equal to the
normal cost of such plans for all Consumer Employees for the Transitional
Period, as determined by the actuary to the Industrial Pension Fund appointed
by the Purchaser in accordance with the local country laws and practices
("Plan Actuary"). Consumer Employees will cease being plan members at the end
of the Transitional Period.  The parties agree that a value transfer
("waardeoverdracht") from the Industrial Pension Funds in respect of the
Consumer Employees shall take place, which value shall be calculated as of
the Closing Date as if the Consumer Employees would leave the employment of
their employer as per such date, but increased by the Seller\'s contributions
for Consumer Employees for the Transitional Period, and decreased by benefits
paid and expenses and insurance premiums incurred during the Transitional
Period for Consumer Employees, and then adjusted for interest at a
rate determined by the Plan Actuary to reflect investment performance of the
plan during the Transitional Period. Furthermore, the calculation of the
amounts of the value transfer shall be on the basis of the actuarial and
accounting practices and principles consistently applied by the relevant
Industrial Pension Fund and in accordance with the rules of the relevant
Industrial Pension Fund and local legislation. The Purchaser shall cause
the relevant Industrial Pension Funds to transfer the amounts
thus established to a pension fund and/or an insurer to be designated by the
Seller within six months from the Closing.  Prior to Closing the parties
hereto shall agree to a more detailed arrangement regarding the foregoing
value transfer, which arrangement shall be based on the principles set forth
in this Article 9.4.  9.5 Service Agreement  On the Closing Date the
Parties shall sign a Service Agreement substantially in the form as attached
hereto as Schedule 5.  9.6 Insurance Policies  For the avoidance of doubt,
the Parties acknowledge that the insurance policies as listed on Schedule 11
will terminate in respect of the Industrial Packaging Division as per
Closing. The Seller and the Purchaser will use their reasonable best efforts
to agree prior to Closing on a suitable transition period
arrangement together with the insurers with the objective of the
least possible disruption to the operations of the Company\'s Group.
Any claims arising out of events occurring prior to Closing will be the
responsibility of the Seller and Seller will have to provide the required
run-off insurance coverage. The Seller and the Purchaser will use their best
efforts to agree on the best approach to implement these objectives in a
timely manner.  9.7 Resignation of Directors  The Seller shall procure
that at Closing, all persons acting on behalf of the Seller on any of the
boards of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries will resign and the
Purchaser shall procure that such resignations are accepted and that (without
prejudice to the Purchaser\'s rights against Seller under the
Seller\'s Representations and Warranties and other indemnities pursuant
to this Agreement) such persons will be discharged at Closing for
the performance of their duties up until Closing.  9.8 Custody
Agreement  At Closing, the Parties and the Civil Law Notary shall sign
a custody agreement in the form as attached as Schedule 26 (the "Custody
Agreement") governing the terms and conditions upon which the Due Diligence
Information will be given into the custody of the Civil Law Notary.  9.9
Further Closing actions to be taken  At the Closing the Parties shall
further take such actions and shall sign and execute such documents and
agreements as shall be required to be taken, signed or executed, in order to
complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and as will be
listed in a separate Closing agenda that shall be signed by all Parties as
evidence of all actions referred to therein having been taken and all
documents and agreements listed therein having been duly signed and executed
in the consecutive order set forth in such Closing agenda.  ARTICLE 10 NON-
COMPETITION AND CONFIDENTIALITY  10.1 Non-Competition Seller  The Seller
hereby agrees and undertakes that it will not:  (a) in any of the

customer, supplier  of or other company or enterprise doing business with
the  Company\'s Group to terminate its relationship with the  Company\'s
Group or take any action that may result in the  impairment of such

the Seller shall not be deemed to have violated the terms of this Article
10.1 as a result of (i) ownership by the Seller directly or indirectly of
less than ten percent (10 %) of the outstanding shares of capital stock of
any publicly traded company with one or more classes of capital stock listed
on a national securities exchange or publicly traded market, or (ii) the
purchase by the Seller directly or indirectly of any business which primarily
is engaged in activities that do not fall under the scope of this Article
10.1, but which business is engaged for a lesser part of its business in
activities that do fall under the scope of this Article 10.1, provided that
the Seller first offers to the Purchaser the right to acquire such
competitive business on terms and conditions and at the allocable share of
the price paid pursuant to the Seller\'s acquisition thereof.  10.2 Non-
Solicitation Purchaser  The Purchaser hereby agrees and undertakes that it
will not for a period of three years from the Closing persuade, cause or
attempt to persuade any employee or any sales representative or agent of the
Consumer Packaging Division to terminate his or her or their relationship
with the Consumer Packaging Division.  10.3 Confidentiality  Without
prejudice to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement the Parties
undertake not at any time subsequent to this Agreement to divulge or
communicate to any company, person or entity (other than to the other Party
or the Company\'s Group, as the case may be, or to any of their directors or
employees who need to acquire such knowledge in the performance of their
duties or as directed or approved by the other Party in writing)

that case only  after consultation with the other Party about the timing

conditions of  confidentiality and only to the extent necessary for
advising  such Party; or  (c) to the extent that such information is at the
date hereof or  hereafter becomes public knowledge other than through 
improper disclosure by any person.  10.4 Name Van Leer and Huhtamaki  The
Seller shall exercise its reasonable efforts to cease the use of the name
"Van Leer" by itself and its subsidiaries (excluding the Company\'s Group)
within a reasonable period after Closing not to exceed nine months, during
which the Seller and its subsidiaries shall be allowed to continue to use the
name "Van Leer". The name "HVL", wherever used (including in any domain
name) shall remain with the Seller. The Seller shall forward to the Purchaser
all e-mails and other correspondence that concern the Industrial Packaging
Division and that are received by the Seller (or any of its subsidiaries,
excluding the Company\'s Group) in the period two months following
the Closing Date.  The Purchaser shall exercise its reasonable efforts to
cease the use of the names "Huhtamaki" and "Huhtamaki" by itself and
the Company\'s Group within a reasonable period after Closing not to exceed
9 months during which the Purchaser and the Company\'s Group shall be allowed
to continue to use the names " Huhtamaki" and "Huhtamaki". The Purchaser
shall forward to the Seller all e-mails and other correspondence that concern
the Consumer Packaging Division and that are received by the Purchaser or
any of its subsidiaries in the period two months following the Closing
Date.  ARTICLE 11 ANNOUNCEMENT  11.1 Disclosure  No Party shall make any
disclosure to any third party about this Agreement, its contents or any other
agreement referred to in this Agreement without the prior consent of the
other Party except:  (a) to the extent required by applicable law or stock
exchange  rules or by any competent authority but in that case only  after

confidentiality and only to the extent necessary for advising  such
Party.  11.2 Press release  Upon signing of this Agreement, the Parties
shall issue separate press releases in the form as attached as Schedule
13.  ARTICLE 12 TERMINATION  12.1 Termination  This Agreement may only

of a breach of this Agreement by the terminating  Party; or  (c) by the
Purchaser or the Seller, as the case may be, in the  situation referred to in
Article 8.5; or  (d) (i) by the Purchaser or the Seller at any time after

Stichting Van Leer Group Foundation prior to expiration of  its period of

(with the exception of Article 10.3 (Confidentiality), Article 11
(Announcements), this Article 12 (Termination) and Articles 13
(Miscellaneous) and 14 (Governing Law and Disputes), which shall survive

part of each Party for its own expenses  incurred in connection with the
preparation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and  (b)
the liability of either Party to the other Party for damages  and/or costs

to termination pursuant to Section  12.1(d) (i) or (ii), within fifteen (15)
days after any such  termination the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser in 
immediately available funds US$ 10 million plus all of the  Purchaser\'s out-

27 OCTOBER 2000   between   HUHTAMAKI VAN LEER OYJ   as the
Seller     and      GREIF BROS. CORPORATION   as the
Purchaser    for the acquisition by the Purchaser  of the entire issued
share capital of  Royal Packaging Industries Van Leer N.V.   NAUTADUTILH 
Amsterdam  Place: Amstelveen/Espoo Date: 5 January 2001   THE
UNDERSIGNED:  (1) HUHTAMAKI VAN LEER OYJ, a company duly incorporated and 
validly existing under the laws of Finland, established and  having its
principal office in Espoo as the seller (the  "Seller"); and  (2) GREIF
BROS. CORPORATION, a corporation organised under the  laws of the State of
Delaware, USA, having its principal  offices at 425 Winter Road, Delaware,
Ohio, USA as the  purchaser (the "Purchaser");  WHEREAS:  A. The
Purchaser and the Seller have entered into an agreement  dated 27 October
2000 regarding the sale and transfer of all  shares in the capital of Royal
Packaging Industries Van Leer  N.V. (the "Agreement");  B. The earnings
before interest and taxes ("EBIT") of the  Industrial Packaging Division
since the Pro Forma Accounts  Date through 30 November 2000 and the prospects
in respect  of EBIT for the remaining part of the year 2000 deviate 
negatively from the EBIT of the Industrial Packaging  Division which was
estimated for such periods as per the  date of signing of the Agreement (such
deviation the  "Negative Deviation"). Schedule A attached hereto purely for 
identification purposes contains the following information  in respect of the
Negative Deviation: (a) the actual EBIT of  the Industrial Packaging Division
for the period from 1  January 2000 through 30 November 2000; and (b) the
estimate  of EBIT of the Industrial Packaging Division for the period  1
January 2000 through 31 December 2000. The outlook for  EBIT of the
Industrial Packaging Division for 2001 deviates  negatively from the outlook
for EBIT of the Industrial  Packaging Division which was estimated for 2001
as per the  date of signing the Agreement (such deviation the "Reduced 
Outlook"). In consideration for the Negative Deviation and  the Reduced
Outlook, the Parties to the Agreement have  agreed to a reduction of the
Purchase Price;  C. The Parties wish to record their amendment to the
Agreement  in this Amendment Agreement;  NOW HEREBY AGREE AS
FOLLOWS:  ARTICLE 1 DEFINITIONS  Capitalised terms used in this Amendment
Agreement and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth
in the Agreement.  ARTICLE 2 PURCHASE PRICE  The Parties hereto hereby
agree that Article 3.2, third and fourth paragraph, of the Agreement is
hereby amended and shall read as follows:  "The Provisional Purchase Price
shall be a sum equal to US$ 555,000,000 (five hundred and fifty five million
US dollars) minus the Estimated Net Outstanding Indebtedness, if
it represents a negative amount, or plus the Estimated Net Outstanding
Indebtedness, if it represents a positive amount, and shall be increased, if
the Estimated Net Working Capital is higher than the Pro Forma Accounts Net
Working Capital, or shall be decreased, if the Estimated Net Working Capital
is lower than the Pro Forma Accounts Net Working Capital, by the difference
between the Estimated Net Working Capital and the Pro Forma Accounts Net
Working Capital.  If the Provisional Purchase Price for the shares
would exceed US$ 555,000,000 (five hundred and fifty five million US
dollars), the Seller will cause the Company to declare a dividend payable to
the Seller in an amount which is equal to the lower of (i) such excess and
(ii) the amount of the distributable reserves of the Company in order to
reduce the Provisional Purchase Price with the amount of such dividend. The
Seller and/or Huhtamaki Finance Oy will make a loan to the Company to the
extent there is not sufficient cash in the Company\'s Group to pay the
aforementioned dividend. The amount of such loan will be taken into account
by the Seller in calculating and estimating the Estimated Net
Outstanding Indebtedness."  ARTICLE 3 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND WAIVER  The
Purchaser hereby expressly confirms and agrees that from and after the date
hereof it shall have no claim whatsoever under the Agreement, including but
not limited to the Seller\'s Representations and Warranties or any
indemnities of the Seller thereunder, due to or as a result of the Negative
Deviation, the Reduced Outlook, or the actual EBIT of the Industrial
Packaging Division for 2001 up to Closing. In particular, and
without prejudice to the Seller\'s position that these Articles are
not applicable anyway, the Purchaser confirms that it has no claim under
Article 8.5 of the Agreement or under Section 7.1 of the Seller\'s
Representations and Warranties with respect to the Negative Deviation, the
Reduced Outlook, or the actual EBIT of the Industrial Packaging Division for
2001 up to Closing. If and to the extent that the Purchaser could
nevertheless be said to have any such claim under the Agreement, including
but not limited to the Seller\'s Representations and Warranties, it hereby
expressly waives in favour of the Seller all of its rights in respect of any
such claim.  ARTICLE 4 MISCELLANEOUS  4.1 If and to the extent there is a
material adverse change in  the Negative Deviation which occurs and becomes
known to the  Parties before Closing, then, only with respect to such 
excess deviation from the Negative Deviation, Article 3  hereof shall not
apply and the Seller and the Purchaser  shall not be prejudiced in any of
their respective other  rights under the Agreement and this Amendment
Agreement,  provided, however, that no write-offs or other non-recurring 
items, whether already stated in item (b) of Schedule A or  included in the
year to date 30 November 2000 results or  otherwise, will for the purposes
hereof be taken into  account in respect of the determination of the actual 
results for the entire year 2000.  4.2 Articles 1.2, 10.3, 11, 13 and 14 of
the Agreement apply  mutatis mutandis to this Amendment Agreement and are 
considered to be repeated and included herein.  Thus agreed and signed in
two original copies on 5 January 2001.  HUHTAMAKI VAN LEER OYJ GREIF BROS.

or discrepancy between the terms of the local agreements regarding the
transactions mentioned in Article 2.1 hereof and the Agreement, including the
First Amendment Agreement and this Second Amendment Agreement, the provisions
of the Agreement, including the First Amendment Agreement and this Second
Amendment Agreement, shall prevail.  2.3 Purchase Price Allocation  The
amounts to be paid as purchase price for the shares which will be transferred
separately in accordance with Article 2.1 hereof, are included in the amount
of the Purchase Price as defined in the Agreement.  The Parties agree that
the parts of the Purchase Price allocable to the shares mentioned in Article
2.1 in respect of USA, France and Brazil, are set out in Schedule AII.1
hereto.  The final consideration amounts paid in connection with
the transactions in respect of the Reorganisation are listed in Schedule
AII.2 hereto. The Purchaser\'s acknowledgement of such amounts shall have no
effect on its right under Article 7.2 of the Agreement, including Seller\'s
indemnity of the Purchaser contained therein.  The Parties undertake that
they shall prepare all of their respective tax returns (belasting aangiften)
in the respective countries in accordance with the allocation as contained in
such Schedules AII.1 and AII.2.  2.4 Annex 6 and Schedules 8 (i) and
8(ii)  The Parties agree that there have been some changes in respect of

have further agreed to certain changes to Schedule 8 (ii) as set out in
Schedule AII. 3 attached hereto.  2.5 Closing Balance Sheet Date  The
Parties hereby agree that the Closing Balance Sheet Date shall be 28 February

Conditions Excluded  from Insurance  The Parties were unable to obtain
insurance coverage under the Environmental Insurance Policy for third party
claims related to Environmental Matters identified in the Known
Conditions Schedule, Endorsement 6 to the Environmental Insurance
Policy. The Parties hereby amend the Agreement and agree that such
third party claims shall not be subject to the Purchaser\'s obligation in
Article 6.11.6(a) and shall be subject to immediate cost sharing under
Article 6.11.6(b).  3.2 Seller\'s Representation - Article 6.11.12.G  The
following provision shall be deemed to have been inserted in Clause 6.11.12
(G) of the Agreement:  "The Seller has not made any material
misrepresentation, which affects the insurability of the risk, towards
the insurers under the Environmental Insurance Policy. The statements
contained in the Declarations (as defined in the Environmental Insurance
Policy) and any other supplemental materials and information submitted to ECS
Underwriting, Inc. as a part of the application process or with
the application, for the Environmental Insurance Policy are the Seller\'s
agreements and representations. The statements and facts set forth in the
application, including the supplemental materials and information, for
the Environmental Insurance Policy towards ECS Underwriting, Inc. and relied
on by all insurers are true and no material facts have been suppressed or
misstated therein."  ARTICLE 4 ARTICLE 4.3 OF THE AGREEMENT  4.1 Working
capital amount in the Pro Forma Accounts  The Parties have acknowledged that
there was a mistake in the Pro Forma Accounts which has an effect on the Pro
Forma Accounts Net Working Capital and the Parties wish to correct
such mistake. Consequently, the Parties hereby agree that the amount of the
Pro Forma Accounts Net Working Capital as included in the Pro Forma Accounts
shall be revised on the amount of EUR 205,344,000 (two hundred and five
million and three hundred and forty four thousand Euro).  4.2 United States
of America  (i)\tSplit dollar life statement  The Parties agree that the
"Provisions for liabilities and other charges" in the Closing Balance Sheet
will include the full liability for post-retirement benefits without netting
out the value of the US cash surrender value life ("split dollar
life") insurance policies, which are an asset of Van Leer Containers. As a
consequence, the Estimated Net Outstanding Indebtedness is increased by USD
4,000,000 (four million US Dollar).  (ii)\tPost retirement benefits
statement  For the establishment of the Closing Balance Sheet
medical inflation percentages shall be used for the United States of America
of 7.25%, grading down 0.5% each year to an ultimate rate of 4.75%, using a
discount rate of 7.5%. As a consequence, the Estimated Net Outstanding
Indebtedness is increased by USD 2,000,000 (two million US Dollar).  4.3
The Netherlands, France and Germany  (i)\tBack service pension liabilities
in the Netherlands  The Parties acknowledge that the liability for unfunded
back service pension liabilities in the Netherlands as of 31 December 1999
has been duly included in the Pro Forma Accounts.  (ii)\tFunding of
liabilities France  The Parties agree that the liability in France relating
to the provision for medical and life insurance benefits for
former employees between early retirement and age 65 and the liability
in France relating to the benefits arising from the early
retirement convention shall not be included under "Provisions for
liabilities and other charges" in the Closing Balance
Sheet.  (iii)\tFunding of liabilities Germany  The Seller hereby
represents and warrants to the Purchaser that the reserve in the Germany
local accounts as at 31 December 1999 of DM 15,225,615 (fifteen million and
two hundred and twenty five thousand and six hundred and fifteen German Mark)
relates entirely to re-insurance assets. In reliance on the foregoing,
the Purchaser agrees that the Pro Forma Accounts do not understate
the pension liabilities in Germany as of 31 December 1999.  4.4 Full
Agreement  The Parties acknowledge and agree that they have now
reached full agreement on all issues which pursuant to Article 4.3 of the
Agreement have to be agreed upon prior to Closing.  ARTICLE 5
PENSION  Article 9.4 of the Agreement provides that prior to Closing
the parties shall agree on a more detailed arrangement regarding the value
transfers mentioned in such Article 9.4 in respect of the Consumer Employees
(as listed on Schedule 15). Such more detailed arrangement is set forth below
and will be in addition to the mechanics already provided for in Article 9.4
of the Agreement:  (i)\tUnited States of America  The Parties have
meanwhile agreed that Ken Andre will remain with the Industrial Packaging
Division.  Steve Murphy has already left the relevant Industrial
Pension Fund.  Brad Kerle and Theo Kalifatidis are both expatriated
Australians who have remained within the Australian pension fund. They
shall be deemed to have been added to the Australia Chapter of the list of
Consumer Employees (Schedule 15 to the Agreement).  Based on the above
circumstances, the Parties agree that no value transfer has to take place in
respect of Consumer Employees in the United States of
America.  (ii)\tUnited Kingdom  All Consumer Employees listed on Schedule
15 under the heading "United Kingdom" will cease to be active members and
become deferred members of the relevant Industrial Pension Funds as per the
Closing Date, in accordance with the rules for leaving service of the
relevant Industrial Pension Fund, being either the Van Leer (UK) Staff
Pension Scheme or the Van Leer (UK) Works Pension Scheme. As per the Closing
Date, these members will be entitled to take a transfer from their scheme on
the normal cash equivalent basis in force at the date they transfer, which
amount will be no less than the cash equivalent as at the date of transfer as
defined in the Pension Schemes Act 1993. A value transfer
("waardeoverdracht") as provided for in Article 9.4, second paragraph, of the
Agreement from the relevant Industrial Pension Funds shall take place in
accordance with such provision.  (iii)\tAustralia  The Consumer Employees
in Australia are members of the Van Leer Australia Salaried Staff
Superannuation Plan ("VLASSSP"). Under the governing superannuation
legislation (Superannuation Industry Supervision (SIS) Regulation 6.29), a
transfer of a member\'s benefits from one fund to another must be with
the consent of the member or the new fund must be a Successor Fund. A
Successor Fund approach has been adopted by the Seller. The benefits of the
Consumer Employees in Australia will be transferred to the Oceana
Superannuation Fund ("OSF"). A deed of amendment to the VLASSSP trust deed
was signed on 20 October 2000 to allow the trustee of the VLASSSP to transfer
members to another fund if satisfied that the new fund can be regarded as
a Successor Fund.  The OSF trust deed provides equivalent benefits for
the transferring employees from VLASSSP. As a result, the Seller hereby
warrants that members\' accrued benefits in the VLASSSP can be transferred to
the OSF as a Successor Fund without individual member consent being
required.  The amount to be transferred to the OSF in respect of
the transferring members will be the equitable share of the total defined
benefit assets in the VLASSSP as at the date of transfer, including a share
of any surplus. Assets representing members\' Voluntary Contribution Accounts
and Surcharge Offset Accounts are specifically allocated to individual
members and would not form part of the equitable share calculation
(but would be transferred in addition).  (iv)\tSouth Africa  The two
Consumer Employees listed on Schedule 15 under the heading "South Africa",
i.e. A.J. Jardine and C.A. Reynecke, have both left the relevant Industrial
Pension Fund since the date of the Agreement.  A.J. Jardine has retired and
C.A. Reynecke has been transferred to an outside pension fund; a value
transfer in respect of C.A. Reynecke has already taken place.  Based on the
above circumstances, the Parties agree that no value transfer has to take
place in respect of Consumer Employees in South Africa.  ARTICLE 6 VAN LEER
COORDINATION CENTRE  The Parties confirm that the transfer of Van Leer
Coordination Center N.V. (the "VLC Center") to the Consumer Packaging
Division, as referred to in Article 7.4 of the Agreement, has not
taken place on the date hereof and will not take place prior to Closing. The
Purchaser agrees that it shall not close down VLC Center before 1 August 2001
but that it shall close down VLC Center as soon as practicable thereafter.
Until closing down is completed, the Purchaser will procure that VLC Center
will be run in its ordinary course of business consistent with the period
before Closing. The Seller shall hold the Purchaser harmless against
and shall reimburse the Purchaser upon its first request for all
costs actually incurred by VLC Center or the Purchaser\'s Group of Companies
in connection with (a) the operational costs of VLC Center, other than the
salary costs of the employees listed in Annex AII.4 attached hereto (the
"Industrial Employees") and (b) the closing down of VLC Center, provided that
the Seller shall only be liable for dismissal costs up until 1 August 2002
and only in relation to the employees who (i) are employed by VLC Center
as at Closing and are not Industrial Employees and (ii) following their
dismissal, are not employed within Purchaser\'s group of companies. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser shall have no obligation to employ, or
offer employment to, within the Purchaser\'s group of companies, any employee
who is currently employed by VLC Center.  ARTICLE 7 INSURANCE  Article
9.6 of the Agreement provides that the Seller and the Purchaser will use
their reasonable best efforts to agree prior to Closing on a suitable
transition period arrangement with respect to the insurance policies as
listed on Schedule 11 which will terminate in respect of the Industrial
Packaging Division as per Closing. The Parties hereby agree that no
such arrangement is necessary and that consequently neither Party has any
further obligation pursuant to such Article 9.6. except that any claims
arising out of events occurring prior to Closing that would otherwise be
covered by such terminated insurance policies, will be the responsibility of
the Seller whether or not it obtains run-off insurance coverage.  ARTICLE 8
KENTUCKY REAL ESTATE  The Parties acknowledge that the fact that the
Purchaser is aware of a potential problem in connection with the lease of
the plant in Florence, Kentucky, will not prejudice the rights of the
Purchaser under the Seller\'s Representations and Warranties or the
indemnities as contained in the Agreement  ARTICLE 9
MISCELLANEOUS  Articles 1.2, 10.3, 13 and 14 of the Agreement apply
mutatis mutandis to this Amendment Agreement and are considered to
be repeated and included herein.  Thus agreed and signed in two original
copies in Amsterdam on 28 February 2001.  HUHTAMAKI VAN LEER OYJ GREIF
