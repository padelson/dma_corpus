1

    

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

Section 1.01  _The_ _Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Sub
will be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate corporate
existence of Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and all the property, rights,
immunities, powers and franchises of Sub and the Company will vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities, duties and
obligations of the Company and Sub will become the debts, liabilities, duties
and obligations of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, and in accordance
with Section 259 of the DGCL.

 

Section 1.02 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place on the third (3rd) Business Day following the date on which each
of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE_ __ _ VI_ is satisfied, or to the
extent permitted by Law, waived by the party entitled to waive such condition
(other than those conditions that by their terms are only capable of being
satisfied on the Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction or, if
permissible, waiver of such conditions by the party entitled to waive such
conditions) by the exchange of electronic signatures and documents, at the
offices of Sidley Austin LLP, One South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois
60603, or at another date or place agreed to in writing by the parties hereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent, Sub and the Company shall not be
required to consummate the Closing prior to the earlier of (a) the second
(2nd) Business Day after the end of the Marketing Period and (b) the date
during the Marketing Period agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company.
The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the " _Closing
Date_." " _Marketing Period_ " means a period of fifteen (15) consecutive
Business Days following the Parents receipt of the Required Information (it
being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that if, after the start of the
Marketing Period, the Company shall provide the Parent with additional
financial statements as required by the definition of Required Information,
the delivery of such additional financial statements will not be deemed to
re-start the Marketing Period); _provided_ that (i) the Marketing Period shall
not commence prior to September 3, 2019, and (ii) November 29, 2019 shall not
be deemed to be a Business Day; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company
shall in good faith believe that it has provided the Required Information to
the Parent, the Company may deliver to the Parent a written notice to that
effect (stating the date on which it believes it completed such delivery), in
which case the Company shall be deemed to have delivered the Required
Information on the date specified in such notice, unless the Parent in good
faith believes either (A) that the Required Information was delivered on a
date later than that specified in the Companys notice or (B) that the Company
has not completed the delivery of Required Information and, within three (3)
Business Days after the delivery of such notice by the Company, delivers a
written notice to the Company to that effect (stating with reasonable
specificity either the date on which the Required Information was delivered
or, if applicable, the Required Information that the Parent believes the
Company has not delivered at that time, in which case the Required Information
shall be deemed to be delivered immediately upon the delivery by the Company
of information reasonably addressing the points contained in such notice). "
_Required Information_ " means the audited financial statements of the Company
for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, December 31,
2016 and subsequent fiscal years ended at least ninety (90) days before the
date of Closing and quarterly unaudited

 



2

    

 financial statements of the Company for each subsequent fiscal quarter
(other than the fourth quarter) ended at least forty-five (45) days before the
date of the Closing, in each case, with comparative financial information for
the equivalent period of the prior year (it being acknowledged that Parent has
received audited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and
unaudited financial statements of the Company for the quarter ended March 31,
2019).

Section 1.03  _Effective Time_. Concurrently with the Closing, the Company
shall file a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on the
date and time at which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other date and time as
is agreed between the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger (such
date and time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.04 _Organizational Documents, Directors and Officers of the
Surviving Corporation_.

 

(a) _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, (i) the Company
Charter, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will by virtue
of the Merger be amended and restated so as to read in its entirety in the
form set forth in _Exhibit_ __ _ A_, and as so amended and restated, shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law and the applicable
provisions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, and (ii) the Company Bylaws shall be amended and
restated in their entirety to read as the bylaws of Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended and restated, shall
thereafter be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (except that references
to the name of Sub shall be replaced by references to the name of the
Surviving Corporation) until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable
Law and the applicable provisions of the certificate of incorporation and the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the board of directors of the
Surviving Corporation effective as of, and immediately following, the
Effective Time shall consist of the members of the board of directors of Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. At
the Closing, the Company shall, to the extent requested by Parent pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 5.16_, deliver to Parent resignations of each of the
directors of the Company and the wholly owned Company Subsidiaries.

 

(c) _Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of Sub at the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to
hold office until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified
or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

 

Section 2.01 _Conversion of Securities_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holders of any capital stock of
the Company or Sub:

(i) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
(each, a " _Share_ ", and collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Excluded
Shares, __ shall automatically be converted into the right to receive $28.00
in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and all of such
Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall cease to exist, and each
certificate representing a Share (a " _Certificate_ ") or a non-certificated
Share represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") that formerly
represented any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter be
cancelled and cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration without interest thereon, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 2.05_.

 

(ii) _Cancellation of Company-Owned Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. All
Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and all Shares owned of record by Parent,
Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto. 

(iii) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, all
certificates representing common stock of Sub shall be deemed for all
purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence.

 

(b) _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the number of outstanding Shares shall have been changed into
a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon
shall be declared with a record date and payment date within said period,
the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to proportionally
reflect such change; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take
any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the payment of RSU Awards on
outstanding unvested RSUs as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.01(e)_ (if any)
shall not be considered a change requiring adjustment under this _Section_ __
_ 2.01(b)_.

 



4

    

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment for Shares_ _._

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
U.S.-based nationally recognized financial institution reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the benefit of the
holders of Shares to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holders
shall become entitled pursuant to this Agreement (if any). At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount in
cash equal to the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_
"). The Exchange Fund shall be for the benefit of the holders of Shares that
are entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. In the event the Exchange
Fund is insufficient to make the payments contemplated by this  _ARTICLE_ __
_ II_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount in
cash sufficient to make such payments. Funds made available to the Paying
Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent, in short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the United States of America with maturities of no
more than thirty (30) days, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to
the holders of Shares pursuant to this _ARTICLE_ __ _ II_; _provided_ that no
investment of such deposited funds shall relieve Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments
required by this _ARTICLE_ __ _ II_, and following any losses from any such
investment, Parent shall promptly deposit with the Paying Agent by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, for the benefit of the holders of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares), an amount in cash equal to the amount of
such losses, which additional funds will be held and disbursed in the same
manner as funds initially deposited with the Paying Agent to make the
payments contemplated by this _ARTICLE_ __ _ II_. Any interest or income
produced by such investments will be payable to Sub, Parent or otherwise, as
Parent directs. Parent shall direct the Paying Agent to hold the Exchange
Fund for the benefit of the persons entitled to Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.01_ and to make payments from the Exchange
Fund in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.02_. The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.02_, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) _Certificated Shares_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time
(but in no event later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the
Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate whose Shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to
the Effective Time), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.02(e)_) to the Paying Agent; and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of any Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.02(e)_) for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, if applicable, and upon delivery of
a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to
such Certificates, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the portion of the Aggregate Common Stock 

 



5

    

 Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificates were converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01_, and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, payment may be made and Merger Consideration may be issued to
a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered
is registered, if such Certificate is properly endorsed or is otherwise in
proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment either pays to
the Paying Agent any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate so surrendered or establishes to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes either have been paid or are
not required to be paid.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Any holder of Book-Entry Shares that were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement
shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this _ARTICLE_ __ _ II_. In lieu
thereof, each registered holder of one or more such Book-Entry Shares shall
automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Merger Consideration for
each such Book-Entry Share, subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.05_. Payment of the
Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to
the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

 

(iii) No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of the Merger
Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.02(e)_) or in respect of
any Book-Entry Share.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. As of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with
the terms of this _ARTICLE_ __ _ II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing Shares (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.02(e)_) are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any
time following the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with
respect thereto) not disbursed to or claimed by holders of Shares,
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving

Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the portion of the Aggregate
Common Stock Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate were converted pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)(_ _i_ _)_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Paying Agent may, in its reasonable
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger
Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate to provide a bond in a customary amount.

Section 2.03 _Treatment of_ _Company Options and Equity Plans_.

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions
that provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding
option to purchase Shares granted under a Company Stock Plan (the " _Company
Options_ ") shall be fully vested and cancelled and, in exchange therefor,
each holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to receive,
in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option and in settlement
therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (i) the
total number of Shares subject to such cancelled Company Option, multiplied by
(ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise
price per Share subject to such cancelled Company Option, without interest
(such amounts payable hereunder, the " _Option Payments_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (1) any such Company Option with respect to which the
exercise price per Share subject thereto is equal or greater than the Merger
Consideration shall be cancelled in exchange for no consideration and (2) such
Option Payments may be reduced by the amount of any required Tax withholdings
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.05_. From and after the Effective Time, no
Company Option shall be exercisable, and each Company Option shall entitle the
holder thereof only to the payment provided for in this _Section_ __ _
2.03(a)_.

 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_.

 

(i) Except as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate,
any committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions that provide that immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each then outstanding unvested award of
restricted stock units (each, an " _RSU_ ") with respect to Shares (each, an
" _RSU Award_ ") granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan, other than any RSU
Award held by a non-employee director of the Company, shall be assumed by
the Surviving Corporation and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, determined as follows: (A) with respect to an RSU
Award subject to performance conditions with a performance period that by its
terms has ended prior to the Effective Time an amount equal to (1) the Merger
Consideration, multiplied

 



7

    

 by (2) the number of RSUs subject to such RSU Award based on actual
performance through the end of such performance period; (B) with respect to an
RSU Award subject to performance conditions with a performance period that by
its terms has not ended prior to the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal
to (1) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (2) the number of RSUs subject
to such RSU Award assuming performance of 100% of target levels; and (C) with
respect to an RSU Award that vests based solely on continued employment, an
amount in cash equal to (1) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (2) the
number of RSUs subject to such RSU Award (such RSU Awards, as converted
pursuant to clauses (A) through (C) of this sentence, the " _Replacement RSU
Awards_ "). Each Replacement RSU Award will be subject to the same terms and
conditions, including vesting and settlement, as applied to the RSU Award for
which the Replacement RSU Award was exchanged, except for terms rendered
inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
for such other changes that are not materially detrimental to the holders are
necessary for the administration of the Replacement RSU Awards.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)(i)_,
(I) the terms of the Replacement RSU Awards shall be amended as set forth on
_Section_ __ _ 2.03_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, and (II) no change to
any existing award agreement shall cause the Replacement RSU Awards to violate
Code Section 409A or the terms of any applicable Company Benefit Plan.

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions that provide that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding unvested RSU Award granted
pursuant to a Company Stock Plan and held by a non-employee director of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be fully vested and
cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled RSU
Award shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of
such RSU Award and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash, without
interest, of an amount equal to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration
multiplied by (B) the number of RSUs subject to such RSU Award (such amounts
payable hereunder, the " _RSU Payments_ ") (less any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.05_).

(c) _Termination of Company Stock Plans_. As of the Effective Time, all
Company Stock Plans shall terminate, and no further rights with respect to
Shares shall be granted thereunder.

 

(d) _Treatment of Company Stock Purchase Plan_. The provisions of _Section_ __
_ 2.03(a)_ shall not apply to any rights under the Company Stock Purchase
Plan. With respect to the Company Stock Purchase Plan, as soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) shall adopt resolutions or take other actions as may be required to
provide that no further Offering Period (as defined in the Company Stock
Purchase Plan) will commence or be extended pursuant to the Company Stock
Purchase Plan after the date hereof. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
will take all action that may be necessary to, effective upon the
consummation of the Merger: (i) cause the Purchase Date (as defined in the
Company Stock Purchase Plan) with respect to any Offering Period that would
otherwise occur on or after the Effective Time, if any, to occur no later
than one Business Day prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs;
(ii) make any pro rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the
shortened Offering Period, but otherwise treat such shortened Offering Period
as a

 



8

    

 fully effective and completed Offering Period for all purposes pursuant to
the Company Stock Purchase Plan; and (iii) cause the exercise (as of no later
than one (1) Business Day prior to the date on which the Effective Time
occurs) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the Company Stock
Purchase Plan. On such exercise date, if any, referred to in clause (iii) of
the preceding sentence, the Company will apply the funds credited as of such
date pursuant to the Company Stock Purchase Plan within each participants
payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole Shares in accordance with
the terms of the Company Stock Purchase Plan and will cause the remaining
accumulated but unused payroll deductions to be distributed to the relevant
participants without interest as promptly as practicable following such
exercise date. Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time,
the Company will terminate the Company Stock Purchase Plan.

(e) _Parent Funding_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with the Surviving Corporation cash in the amount
sufficient for the Surviving Corporation to make the payments required under
this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
(or other applicable person) to make the payments required under this
_Section_ __ _ 2.03_ as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, or
at such later time as necessary to avoid a violation of, or adverse tax
consequences under, Section 409A of the Code. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay through the Payroll Agent the applicable Option
Payments and RSU Payments to the holders of Company Options and RSU Awards, in
each case, subject to  _Section_ __ _ 2.05_, _provided_ that payments to the
former directors of the Company shall be made by the Surviving Corporation (or
such other applicable person) directly.

 

Section 2.04 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any issued and outstanding Shares held by a person who is
entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and has complied
with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of Shares
to require appraisal of such Shares (such shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ ",
and each holder of Dissenting Shares, a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
described in  _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)(_ _i_ _)_ , and as of the Effective
Time, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
cease to exist, but shall become the right to receive such consideration as
may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting
Stockholder effectively withdraws such Dissenting Stockholders demand for
appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses such Dissenting
Stockholders right of appraisal with respect to such Shares, in any case
pursuant to the DGCL, such Shares shall be deemed not to be Dissenting Shares
and shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration for each such Share, without interest and
subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.05_, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain
liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for such Shares. The Company
shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of
Shares received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served on the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and
(b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal rights. The Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, settle or offer
to settle, or approve any withdrawal of, any such demands.

 



9

    

Section 2.05 _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable in respect of the Company Options and RSU
Awards cancelled in the Merger such Tax amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, any
regulation promulgated thereunder by the United States Department of Treasury
(a " _Treasury Regulation_ ") or any other applicable state, local or foreign
Tax Law. To the extent that Tax amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld Tax
amounts (a) shall be remitted by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (b)
to the extent so remitted shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the holder of Company Options or RSU Awards in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

statements, as permitted by SEC rules and regulations, (y) present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company and the
consolidated Company Subsidiaries and the results of their operations and
their cash flows as of the dates and for the periods referred to therein

relationship between or among the Company and any Company Subsidiary, on the
one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, on the other hand), including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, or
any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation

Section 3.08 _Internal Controls and Disclosure Controls_. The Company has
established and maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that material information relating to the
Company required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files
or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Companys management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal
controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2018,
and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. Based on its
evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting for the quarter
ended March 31, 2019, management of the Company has disclosed to the Companys
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (a) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect, in any material respect, the Companys ability to report financial
information and (b) any fraud or allegations of fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting, and each such
deficiency, weakness and fraud so disclosed to auditors, if any, has been
disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof. The Company and each Company
Subsidiary has substantially addressed any such deficiency, material weakness

in respect of _Section_ __ _ 5.01(k)_.

 

(d) Parent and Sub each acknowledges that there may have been or may be
disruption to the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries business as a

defined in Section 147.1(1) of the Tax Act).

(e) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Transactions will (either alone or in conjunction with any other
event) result in, cause the accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or

officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or result in
any limitation on the right of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to amend,
merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Company Benefit
Plan or related trust, including any such payments or benefits to any
"disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in proposed Treasury

Section 4.05 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is
no Proceeding to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party pending
or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay

of this Agreement, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
outstanding Order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree that, individually or

All of the issued and outstanding share capital of Sub is, and at the
Effective Time will be, owned by Parent. Sub was formed solely for the purpose
of engaging in the Transactions, and it has not conducted any business prior

will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than
those incidental to its formation and contemplated by this Agreement, the
Financing or the Transactions.

 

Section 4.07 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of (i) the
executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Equity
Commitment Letter_ "), among the Parent, Sub and the other party thereto (the
" _Equity Financing Source_ "), pursuant to which the Equity Financing Source
has committed, on the terms and subject only to the terms thereof, to invest
the amounts set forth therein at the date and time at which the Closing is
required to occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.02_ and to which the Company
is an express third party beneficiary (the " _Equity Financing_ "), and (ii)
the executed commitment letter (together with the term sheet and any other
annexes, exhibits, schedules and other attachments thereto), dated as of the
date hereof (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Equity
Commitment Letter, the " _Financing Commitments_ ") from Royal Bank of Canada,
UBS AG, UBS Securities LLC, Macquarie Capital Funding LLC and Macquarie
Capital (USA) Inc., pursuant to which the financial institutions and other
lenders party thereto (the " _Lenders_ " and, together with the Equity
Financing Source, the " _Financing Sources_ ") have committed, on the terms
and subject only to the terms thereof, to lend the amounts set forth therein
for purposes of funding the Transactions at the date and time at which the
Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.02_ (the " _Debt
Financing_ " and, together with the Equity Financing, the " _Financing_ ").
Parent has also delivered to the Company true and complete copies of any fee
letter (with only the fee amounts, pricing caps and flex provisions (none of
which individually or in the aggregate would reduce the amount of the Debt
Financing or adversely affect the availability of the Debt Financing or delay
or prevent the Closing or make the funding of the Debt Financing less likely
to occur) redacted) relating to the Debt Commitment Letter (any such fee
letter, a " _Fee Letter_ ") and any engagement letters or other agreements
relating to the Debt Financing.

(b) Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing
Commitments, and the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __
_ 6.02(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_, the aggregate net proceeds from the
Financing when funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments are
sufficient to fund all of the amounts required to be provided by Parent or Sub
for the consummation of the Transactions and are sufficient for the
satisfaction when due of all of the obligations of Parent and Sub under this
Agreement, including the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration and the
amounts payable pursuant to

 



36

    

  _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ and the payment of all costs and expenses of the
Transactions (including any such costs and expenses payable by the Surviving
Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries) which become due or payable by the
Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary in connection with, or as a
result of, the Transactions and any repayment or refinancing of Indebtedness
required in connection therewith or contemplated by any of the Financing
Commitments (collectively, the " _Financing Uses_ ").

(c) As of the date hereof, all of the Financing Commitments are in full force
and effect and have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded (or
contemplated to be withdrawn, terminated or rescinded) or otherwise amended,
supplemented or modified (or contemplated to be amended, supplemented or
modified) in any respect. As of the date hereof, each of the Financing
Commitments, in the form delivered to the Company, is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent, Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other
parties thereto, enforceable against such parties in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. To the knowledge of
Parent, there is no fact or occurrence existing on the date hereof that would
or would reasonably be expected to make any of the assumptions or any of the
statements set forth in the Financing Commitments inaccurate or that would or
would reasonably be expected to cause the Financing Commitments to be
ineffective. There are no side letters or other Contracts or arrangements
(except for any Fee Letters, engagement letters with respect Debt Financing
and any other agreements, each of which have been delivered to the Company in
accordance with the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 4.07(a)_) relating to the
Financing Commitments. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
breach on the part of Parent or Sub under any term, or a failure of any
condition, of the Financing Commitments or otherwise result in any portion of
the Financing contemplated thereby being unavailable at the date and time at
which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.02_.
Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.02(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_, neither Parent nor Sub has reason to
believe that it, any Equity Financing Source or any Lender would be unable to
satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing Commitments
required to be satisfied by it. Parent and Sub have fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Commitments to be
paid on or before the date of this Agreement. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set
forth in the Financing Commitments (the " _Disclosed Conditions_ "). No person
has any right to impose, and none of Parent or any counterparty to any
Financing Commitment has any obligation to accept, (i) any condition
precedent to such funding or investing other than the Disclosed Conditions,
(ii) any reduction to the aggregate amount available under the Financing
Commitments on the Closing Date or (iii) any term or condition that would
have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount available under the
Financing Commitments on the Closing Date.

(d) Neither Parent nor Sub has, directly or indirectly, entered into an
exclusivity, lock-up or other similar agreement, arrangement or binding
understanding with any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of
debt or equity financing that prohibits such provider from providing or
seeking to provide any services or financing, including debt or equity
financing, to any third party in connection with a transaction relating to the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries (including in connection with the making
of any Competing Proposal) in connection with the Transactions.

 



37

    

Section 4.08 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent and Sub have caused the Guarantor to deliver the Guarantee,
dated as of the date hereof, to the Company. The Guarantee is in full force
and effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended,
supplemented or modified in any respect. The Guarantee is a legal and valid
and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. No
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
could constitute a default or breach on the part of the Guarantor under such
Guarantee.

Section 4.09  _Solvency_. Assuming that (a) the conditions to the obligation
of Parent and Sub to consummate the Merger have been satisfied or waived and
(b) the most recent financial statements included in a Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q or an Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by the Company with the SEC
present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial condition
of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the end of the periods
covered thereby and the consolidated results of operations of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby in accordance
with GAAP, then at and immediately following the Effective Time and after
giving effect to all of the Transactions, including the funding of the Equity
Financing and the Financing Uses, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation, taken as a whole, will be Solvent.

Section 4.10 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
Transactions based on arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, Sub or any
of their respective affiliates.

 

Section 4.11 _Absence of Certain Arrangements_. Other than this Agreement and
as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 4.11_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, as of
the date of this Agreement, there are no Contracts or any commitments to enter
into any Contract between Parent, Sub or any of their respective affiliates,
on the one hand, and any director, officer, employee or stockholder of the
Company, on the other hand, relating to the Transactions or the operations of
the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time. Neither Parent nor any of
its affiliates has entered into any Contract or any commitments to enter into
any Contract pursuant to which: (a) any stockholder of the Company would be
entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the
Merger Consideration or (b) any stockholder of the Company agrees to vote
to adopt this Agreement or approve the Merger or agrees to vote against any
Competing Proposal.

Section 4.12 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. None of Parent, Sub or any
of their "affiliates" or "associates" is, or at any time during the last three
(3) years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company, in each case
as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. None of Parent, Sub or any of their
affiliates beneficially owns (within the meaning of Section 13 of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) as of the date
hereof, or will at any time prior to the Closing Date beneficially own, any
shares of Company Common Stock or other securities convertible into,
exchangeable for or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock or any
securities of any Company Subsidiary, or is a party as of the date hereof, or
will at any time prior to the Closing Date become a party, to any Contract,
arrangement or understanding (other than this Agreement) for the purpose of
acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any shares of Company Common Stock
or other securities convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for
shares of Company Common Stock or any securities of any Company Subsidiary.

5.03(e)_, from the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof will (i) adopt, authorize, approve or
recommend, or resolve to or publicly propose or announce its intention to,
approve or recommend to the stockholders of the Company, any Competing
Proposal, (ii) withhold, modify, qualify or amend, or publicly propose or
announce its intention to withhold, modify, qualify or amend, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) if (A) the Company has received a
Competing Proposal that remains outstanding (and is not a tender offer
or exchange offer addressed by clause (iv) of this sentence), and (B) such
Competing Proposal has not been rejected by the Company, fail to reaffirm the
Company Recommendation within five (5) Business Days after receipt of a
written request from the Parent to do so; _provided_ that Parent may only
request one such reaffirmation with respect to any Competing Proposal (it
being understood and agreed that, if and solely to the extent the Company
determines in good faith, in consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
applicable Law, the Company may, in connection with such reaffirmation, state
that it is continuing to negotiate with the person that made such Competing
Proposal, and such statement shall not be considered a Change of Company
Recommendation), (iv) fail to recommend against any Competing Proposal that is
a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act within ten (10)

 



44

    

 Business Days after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer
(it being understood and agreed that, if and solely to the extent the Company
determines in good faith, in consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
applicable Law, the Company may, in connection with such recommendation
against, state that it is continuing to negotiate with the person that made
such Competing Proposal, and such statement shall not be considered a Change
of Company Recommendation) (any action set forth in the foregoing clause (i),
(ii), (iii) or (iv), a " _Change of Company Recommendation_ ") or (v) allow
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement to effect any
Competing Proposal, including an Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or agreement requiring the
Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Transactions.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board (or any committee thereof) may make a Change of Company Recommendation
(and, if so desired by the Company Board (or any committee thereof), terminate
this Agreement, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.01(d)_, in order to
cause the Company to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Competing Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ")) if and only
if:

 

(i) (A) a Competing Proposal (that did not result from a breach of _Section_
__ _ 5.03(a)_ (other than any breach that is immaterial and unintentional))
is made to the Company by a third person and (B) the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal;

(ii) the Company provides Parent three (3) Business Days prior written
notice of the Companys intention to make a Change of Company Recommendation
(a " _Notice of Change of Recommendation_ "), which notice shall include (A)
the material terms and conditions of the Competing Proposal (including the
consideration offered therein and the identity of the person or group making
the Competing Proposal) and (B)(1) an unredacted copy of the Alternative
Acquisition Agreement, (2) unredacted copies of all other agreements to be
entered into between the Company and the person making such Superior Proposal
in connection with such Superior Proposal and (3) any financing arrangements
to finance the Competing Proposal if the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) determined such financing arrangements were material to its decision
that the Competing Proposal was superior to the Merger (it being understood
and agreed that (I) such financing arrangements may be redacted to the same
extent as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 4.07_ and (II) neither (x) the
delivery of such Notice of Change of Recommendation, in and of itself, nor (y)
the announcement that the Company has provided such notice, if and solely to
the extent the Company determines in good faith, in consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with applicable Laws, shall constitute a Change of Company
Recommendation);

 



45

    

(iii) if requested by Parent, the Company has negotiated, and directed
any applicable Company Representatives to negotiate, with Parent in good
faith during the three (3) Business Days following the date of such Notice of
Change of Recommendation with respect to any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent; and

(iv) taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement offered by
Parent pursuant to  _clause_ __ _ (iii)_ above, the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) has determined in good faith, (A) after consultation with
the Companys outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Competing Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such
changes irrevocably offered in writing by Parent were to be given effect, and
(B) after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the
failure to make a Change of Company Recommendation would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable
Law; _provided_ , that any material amendment to the terms of such Competing
Proposal (whether or not in response to any changes proposed by Parent
pursuant to _clause_ __ _ (iii)_ above; it being understood and agreed that
any change in the type or amount of per share consideration or purchase price
shall be considered material) shall require a new Notice of Change of
Recommendation and an additional two (2)-Business Day period from the date of
such notice during which the terms of clause _ (iii)_ above and this clause
(iv) shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ (other than the number of Business Days).

(e) Other than in connection with a Competing Proposal (which shall be
subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section_
__ _ 5.03(e)_), prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company
Board (or any committee thereof) from effecting a Change of Company
Recommendation and thereafter terminating this Agreement in response to the
occurrence of a Company Intervening Event if the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a Change of
Company Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, if any only if:

(i) the Company has first given Parent three (3) Business Days advance
notice of its intention to take such action (a " _Notice of Company
Intervening Event_ "), which shall set forth in reasonable detail information
describing the Company Intervening Event (it being understood and agreed that
neither (A) the delivery of such Notice of Company Intervening Event, in and
of itself, nor (B) the announcement that the Company has provided such notice,
if and solely to the extent the Company determines in good faith,
in consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable Laws, shall
constitute a Change of Company Recommendation);

 

(ii) if requested by Parent, the Company has first negotiated, and caused the
Company and its Company Representatives to negotiate, during the three (3)
Business Days following the date of the Notice of Company Intervening Event
(the " _Company Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), with Parent in good faith
regarding any revisions to the terms of the Transactions proposed by Parent
in response to such Company Intervening Event; and

 



46

    

(iii) following the end of the Company Intervening Event Notice Period,
the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and after taking into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement offered by Parent in a
binding irrevocable written offer to the Company pursuant to clause (ii)
above, that a Company Intervening Event continues to exist and that the
failure to make a Change of Company Recommendation would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under
applicable Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board (or any committee thereof) from
disclosing to the stockholders of the Company (i) a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the Exchange Act or (ii) any other disclosure the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) determines in good faith the failure to make would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, and provided such disclosure does not constitute a Change of
Company Recommendation if permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_ or _Section_
__ _ 5.03(e)_ (it being understood that any such action (other than a "stop,
look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated
by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act) may constitute
a Change of Company Recommendation if it otherwise satisfies the definition
thereof). For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that the
issuance by the Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) of a
"stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position, as
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
shall not constitute a Change of Company Recommendation.

 

Section 5.04 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders
Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare and file a preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC.
Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.03_, the Proxy Statement shall include the
Company Recommendation. Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in
the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and shall furnish all
information concerning it, Sub, the Guarantor, any of their affiliates and
any transaction any of them have or are contemplating entering into in
connection with this Agreement that is necessary in connection with the
preparation of the Proxy Statement, and provide such other assistance, as may
be reasonably requested in the connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Proxy Statement. The parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing. Prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement or any related documents (or in each case, any
amendment or supplement thereto other than filings under the Exchange Act
either not related to this Agreement or that relate to a Competing Proposal)
or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company
shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such document or response and shall consider in good faith any comments on
such document or response reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments to the Proxy
Statement from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its
staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and will promptly supply Parent with copies of all correspondence
between the Company and the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement or the Transactions.

 



47

    

(b) If, at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any information
relating to the Company or Parent, Sub, the Guarantor, any of their
respective affiliates or any transaction any of them have or are contemplating
entering into in connection with this Agreement, is discovered by the Company
or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that such document would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall as promptly as practicable notify the other
party. Following such notification, the Company shall file with the SEC
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information as
promptly as reasonably practicable after Parent has had a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon (and the Company has considered in
good faith any comments on such document or response reasonably proposed by
Parent), and to the extent the Company determines it is required by applicable
Law, the Company shall disseminate such amendment or supplement to the
stockholders of the Company.

 

(c) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.03_, the Company shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC for
mailing to the Companys stockholders, establish a record date for, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "
_Company_ _Stockholders_ _Meeting_ ") for the purpose of seeking the Company
Stockholder Approval. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the
adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of
procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by
the Companys stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement)
that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the
Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting. In no event shall the record date
of the Company Stockholders Meeting be changed (i) without Parents prior
written consent in the event such record date would result in the Company
Stockholders Meeting being within ten (10) Business Days of the Outside Date
or (ii) in all other circumstances, without prior consultation with Parent,
in each case of clause (i) and (ii), unless required by applicable Law.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company may, in its reasonable discretion, adjourn, recess or postpone the
Company Stockholders Meeting and, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.04(c)_, may
change the record date thereof, (i) to the extent necessary, in the judgment
of the Company Board, to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to
the Proxy Statement is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting, (ii)
if as of the time for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Stockholder Meeting or to the extent that at such time the Company
has not received proxies sufficient to allow the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting or (iii) to the
extent the Company determines in good faith that failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Companys obligations under
applicable Law. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.03_, the Company Board shall
recommend that the Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement (the "
_Company Recommendation_ "), and the

 



48

    

 Company shall, unless there has been a Change of Company Recommendation or
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement. The Company shall reasonably cooperate with
and keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its
solicitation efforts and voting results following dissemination of
the definitive Proxy Statement.

(e) Notwithstanding any Change of Company Recommendation, the Company shall
submit this Agreement to the holders of Shares for adoption at the Company
Stockholders Meeting unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance
with _ARTICLE_ __ _ VII_ prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting.

 

Section 5.05 _Access to Information_. From the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary
to: (a) provide to Parent and Sub and their respective representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours in such a manner as not to
unreasonably interfere with the operation of any business conducted by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, upon prior written notice to the
Company, to the officers, employees, properties, offices and other facilities
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to the books and records
thereof; and (b) furnish promptly such information concerning the business,
properties, Contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries as Parent or its representatives may reasonably request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to (or to
cause any Company Subsidiary to) afford such access or furnish such
information to the extent that doing so would, in the reasonable judgment of
the Company: (i) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege; (ii)
violate any confidentiality obligations of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to any third person or otherwise breach, contravene or violate any
then effective Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
party; (iii) result in a competitor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
receiving information that is competitively sensitive; or (iv) breach,
contravene or violate any applicable Law (including the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Law);  _provided_ that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not
result in a loss of attorney-client privilege, violate confidentiality
obligations, reveal information to a competitor, or breach, contravene or
violate such applicable Contract or Law. Parent shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives to, hold all
information provided or furnished pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.05_
confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
During any visit to the business or property sites of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries, each of Parent and Sub shall, and shall cause their
respective representatives accessing such properties to, comply, in all
material respects, with all applicable Laws and all of the Companys and the
Company Subsidiaries safety and security procedures. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.05_, from the
date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, none of Parent, Sub or any of
their respective affiliates shall conduct, without the prior written consent
of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), any
environmental investigation at any real property owned or leased by the
Company, and in no event may any environmental investigation include any
sampling or other intrusive investigation of air, surface water, groundwater,
soil or anything else at or in connection with any of such real property. For
the avoidance of doubt, _Section_ __ _ 5.07_ (and not this  _Section_ __ _
5.05_) governs access rights in respect of the Financing.

 



49

    

Section 5.06 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Parent shall (and shall cause Sub, the Guarantor and each of its and their
applicable affiliates to) and, subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.03_, the Company
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to), use its respective reasonable
best efforts to consummate the Transactions and to cause the conditions set
forth in _ARTICLE_ __ _ VI_ to be satisfied. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Parent shall (and shall cause Sub and each of their
applicable affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts to and, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 5.03_, the Company shall (and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to) use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) promptly obtain all
actions or nonactions, consents, Permits (including Environmental Permits),
waivers, approvals, authorizations and orders from Governmental Entities or
other persons necessary or advisable in connection with the consummation of
the Transactions, (ii) as promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten
(10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement (solely with respect to
the HSR Act), make and not withdraw (without the Companys consent) all
registrations and filings with any Governmental Entity or other persons
necessary or advisable in connection with the consummation of
the Transactions, including the filings required of the parties hereto or
their "ultimate parent entities" or "ultimate controlling persons" under the
HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, and promptly make any further filings
pursuant thereto that may be necessary or advisable, (iii) contest and defend
all lawsuits or other legal, regulatory, administrative or other Proceedings
to which it or any of its affiliates is a party challenging or affecting this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, in each case until the
issuance of a final, non-appealable Order with respect to each such
Proceeding, (iv) seek to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or
restraining order which may adversely affect the ability of the parties
hereto to consummate the Transactions, in each case until the issuance of a
final, non-appealable Order with respect thereto, (v) seek to resolve any
objection or assertion by any Governmental Entity challenging this Agreement
or the Transactions, and (vi) execute and deliver any additional instruments
necessary or advisable to consummate the Transactions. The Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall not be required to make any concessions under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.06_ that are not conditioned upon the Closing.

(b) In furtherance of the obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.06(a)_
and notwithstanding any limitations therein or elsewhere in this Agreement,
(i) Parent shall promptly take (and shall cause Sub, the Guarantor and each of
its and their applicable affiliates to take) any and all actions necessary or
advisable in order to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment to the
consummation of the Transactions and obtain all approvals and consents,
including approvals and consents under any Antitrust Laws that may be
required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local Governmental Entity,
in each case with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to
consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable, including operational
restrictions or limitations on, and committing to or effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate orders, trust or otherwise, the sale, license,
disposition or holding separate of, such assets or businesses of Parent, Sub,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective affiliates
(and the entry into agreements with, and submission to decrees, judgments,
injunctions or orders of the relevant Governmental Entity) as may be required
or advisable to obtain such approvals or consents of such Governmental
Entities or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate
or lift, any Orders that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the consummation of the Transactions and (ii) the Company
may make, subject to the condition that the Transactions actually occur, any
undertakings (including

 



50

    

 undertakings to accept operational restrictions or limitations or to make
sales or other dispositions, _provided_ that such restrictions, limitations,
sales or other dispositions are conditioned upon the consummation of the
Transactions) as are required to obtain such approvals or consents of such
Governmental Entities or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of or vacate or lift, any decrees, judgments, injunctions or orders that
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the Transactions. Neither Parent nor Sub, directly or
indirectly, through one or more of their respective affiliates or
otherwise, shall take any action, including acquiring or making any
investment in any person or any division or assets thereof, that would
reasonably be expected to prevent or cause a material delay in the
satisfaction of the conditions contained in  _ARTICLE_ __ _ VI_ or the
consummation of the Merger.

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this  _Section_
__ _ 5.06_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties hereto prompt
notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation,
or Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Transactions; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any
such request, inquiry, investigation, or Proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform
the other parties of any communication to or from the FTC, the Antitrust
Division or any other Governmental Entity regarding the Merger. Each party
hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties and will consider in
good faith the views and comments of the other parties in connection with any
filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument,
opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Transactions. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding, each party hereto will permit
authorized representatives of the other parties to be present at each meeting
or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with, and to
the extent practicable, provided the opportunity to review and provide
comments to in advance (and the other party shall reasonably consider in good
faith the inclusion therein of any such comments timely provided), any
document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in
connection with such request, inquiry, investigation or Proceeding.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 5.06_, no
party hereto shall be in violation of this Agreement by virtue of providing
information that is competitively sensitive to one another on an "outside
counsel only" or other basis designed to ensure compliance with applicable
Law (including the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law).

(d) This  _Section_ __ _ 5.06_ does not govern the obligations of Parent and
Sub to obtain the Financing (which are instead governed by _Section_ __ _
5.07_).

 

Section 5.07 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts and do all things
necessary or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing as soon as
reasonably practicable and, in any event, not later than the date and time the
Closing is required to be effected in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.02_,
on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent applicable, the "flex"
provisions) described in the Financing Commitments (for purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.07_, the Financing Commitments and the Debt Commitment
Letter shall include any Fee Letter), 

 



51

    

 including using reasonable best efforts to (i) enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Financing Commitments on the terms and
conditions (as such terms may be modified or adjusted in accordance with the
terms of, and within the limits of the flex provisions contained in any Fee
Letter) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements_ "), (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all terms,
conditions and covenants, including with respect to the payment of any
commitment, engagement or placement fees, applicable to Parent or Sub in the
Financing Commitments and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, (iii)
consummate and cause the Financing Sources to consummate the Financing at or
prior to Closing, (iv) enforce their rights under the Financing Commitments
and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, including by
affirmatively bringing lawsuits or other proceedings and (v) cause the
Marketing Period to expire as promptly as possible. Parent and Sub shall not
agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any
condition or other provision under the Financing Commitments or the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing without the prior written
consent of the Company (including any amendment of the Financing Commitments
or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or any person with similar roles or
titles who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof).
Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to maintain in
effect the Financing Commitments (including any Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements) until the Transactions are consummated. Neither Parent nor Sub
shall release or consent to the termination of the obligations of the Lenders
under the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall Parent or any of its affiliates (which for purposes of this
Agreement shall be deemed to include each direct or indirect investor or
potential investor in Parent, or any of the Guarantors, Parents or any such
investors financing sources or potential financing sources or other
representatives acting at the direction of or on behalf of Parent, the
Guarantor or such investor) engage any bank, investment bank or other
potential provider of debt or equity financing on an exclusive basis or
otherwise on terms that prohibit or are designed to prevent such provider from
providing or seeking to provide such services or financing to any person in
connection with a transaction relating to the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions (including in
connection with the making of any Competing Proposal).

(c) Parent and Sub shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, prior to or in connection with the Closing, permit or arrange any
debt financing to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary will be a party
or by which any of their respective assets shall be subject or bound, other
than the Debt Financing. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions)
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent and Sub shall use their
reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event but no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day
immediately preceding the Outside Date, arrange and obtain from alternative
sources of financing an amount sufficient to satisfy the Financing Uses, on
terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) that are at least as
favorable to the Company in the aggregate as those contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter, which shall not expand upon the conditions precedent or
contingencies to the funding on the Closing Date of the Financing as set forth
in the Financing Commitments in effect on the date hereof or otherwise
adversely affect the ability or likelihood of Parent and Sub to timely
consummate the Transactions. The new debt commitment letter and

 



52

    

 fee letter entered into in connection with such alternative financing are
referred to, respectively, as a " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ " and a " _New
Fee Letter_." In the event Parent or Sub enter into any such New Debt
Commitment Letter, (i) Parent and Sub shall promptly provide the Company with
true, correct and complete copies thereof, (ii) any reference in this
Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall mean the debt financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to clause (iii) below, and
(iii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter" (and any
definition incorporating the term "Debt Commitment Letter," including the
definition of Definitive Debt Financing Agreements) shall be deemed to include
the Debt Commitment Letter and any Fee Letter to the extent not superseded by
a New Debt Commitment Letter or New Fee Letter, as the case may be, at the
time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letter or New Fee Letter to the
extent then in effect.

 

(d) Parent and Sub shall, and shall cause their representatives to, keep the
Company informed as promptly as practicable in reasonable detail of the
status of their efforts to arrange the Financing and substantially
concurrently provide copies of all documents provided to or from the Lenders
or otherwise related to the Financing to the Company (including any drafts of
the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and
executed copies of any amendments to the Financing Commitments promptly upon
their execution and (ii) give the Company prompt written notice (A) of any
default or breach (or any event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would (or could reasonably be expected to) give rise to any default or
breach) by any party under any of the Financing Commitments or the definitive
agreements relating to the Financing of which Parent or Sub becomes aware, (B)
of any termination of either of the Financing Commitments, (C) of the receipt
of any written notice or other communication from any person with respect to
any (1) actual or potential default, breach, termination or repudiation of any
Financing Commitment, any definitive agreement relating to the Financing or
any provision of the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing, in each case by any party thereto, or (2) material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing
Commitment or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing, and (D) if
for any reason Parent or Sub believe in good faith that they will not be able
to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or
from the sources contemplated by the Financing Commitments or the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing, as the case may be.

(e) Prior to the Closing, at Parents sole expense, the Company shall,
and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and instruct the Company
Representatives to, in each case, use their commercially reasonable efforts to
provide to Parent and Sub all customary cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent that is necessary in connection with the Debt Financing, including
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause management of the Company to

forma financial statements or other information regarding any post-Closing or
pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or other post-

officers certificates and corporate resolutions, as applicable); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.07_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, (1) in no event shall the
"commercially reasonable efforts" of the Company, any Company Subsidiaries or
Company Representatives be deemed or construed to require such persons to,
and such persons shall not be required to, provide such cooperation to the
extent it would (A) interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or (B) require the Company or
any Company Subsidiaries to take any action that would reasonably be expected
to (x) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, the Company Charter
or Company Bylaws or other comparable organizational documents of the Company
Subsidiaries, any applicable Laws or any Contract, (y) cause any condition to
Closing set forth in this Agreement to fail to be satisfied or otherwise
cause any breach of this Agreement that would provide Parent or Sub the right
to terminate this Agreement or (z) result in any employee, officer or director
of such person incurring any personal liability (as opposed to any
liability in his or her capacity as an officer of such person) with respect
to any matters related to the Financing, (2) neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary shall be required to commit to take any action that is not
contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective at or prior to the

54

    

 above, (5) in no event shall the Company be in breach of this Agreement
because of the failure of any financial or other information to be delivered
that is not currently readily available to the Company on the date hereof or
is not otherwise prepared in the ordinary course of business of the Company at
the time requested by Parent, Sub or any Financing Source, (6) neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be responsible for any pro
forma financial statements required to be provided in accordance with the Debt
Commitment Letter, (7) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiaries shall
be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any other
payment (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses that are
reimbursed by Parent as provided below in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.07(e)_) or
incur any other liability or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in
connection with the Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the Effective
Time and (8) nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.07(e)_ or otherwise
shall require the Company or any Company Subsidiary to be an issuer or other
obligor with respect to the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time. The
Company hereby consents to the use of its and the Company Subsidiaries logos
in connection with the Debt Financing so long as such logos are used solely in
a manner that is not intended or reasonably likely to harm, disparage or
otherwise adversely affect the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company shall not be deemed to
have breached this _Section_ __ _ 5.07(e)_ as it relates to the condition
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_ unless the Financing (or any alternative
financing) has not been obtained solely as a result of the Companys or any of
the Company Subsidiaries Intentional Breach of their obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.07(e)_. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in
connection with such cooperation. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the Financing (including any action taken in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 5.07(e)_) and any information utilized in connection
therewith (other than historical information provided in writing by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries specifically for use in connection
therewith).

(f) Each of Parent and Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining
of the Financing or any alternative financing is a condition to the Closing,
and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the Transactions irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Financing or any alternative
financing, subject to the applicable conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _
6.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.02_.

Section 5.08 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release issued by
Parent and the Company concerning this Agreement and the Transactions shall be
a joint press release, the contents of which have received prior approval from
both such parties, and thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to the Transactions and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation; 
_provided_ , that the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.08_
shall not apply to any press release, public statement or other announcement
issued or made, or proposed to be issued or made, by the Company (a)
in connection with a Competing Proposal or Change of Company Recommendation,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.03_, (b) after prior consultation with the other
parties hereto, to the extent practicable 

 



55

    

 under the circumstances, as may be required by applicable Law, the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or (c) that is consistent in
all material respects with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made by a party hereto in accordance with this _Section_ __
_ 5.08_, in each case under this clause (c) to the extent such disclosure is
still accurate. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.08_ shall, but subject to
the Confidentiality Agreement, prevent any affiliate of Parent that is a
private equity or similar investment fund, or any manager or general partner
of any such fund, from reporting or disclosing with respect to fundraising,
marketing, informational or reporting activities, on a confidential basis, to
its partners, investors, potential investors or similar parties, general
information regarding this Agreement and the Transactions, in each case
subject to customary obligations of confidentiality with respect to non-public
information such as transaction value or other specific economic terms. For
the avoidance of doubt, any public filings providing notice to or seeking
approval from any Governmental Entity made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.06_
shall be governed by  _Section_ __ _ 5.06_ and not this _Section_ __ _
5.08_.

Section 5.09  _Directors_ __ _ and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current or former director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, each
fiduciary under benefit plans of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and each such person who performed services at the request of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (each an " _Indemnified Party_ "
and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against (i) all losses,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments,
fines, claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the
next succeeding sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising out of actions
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) to the extent that they
are based on or arise out of the fact that such person is or was a director,
officer, employee or fiduciary under benefit plans or performed services at
the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the " _Indemnified
Liabilities_ "), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they are
based on or arise out of or pertain to the Transactions, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and including any expenses
incurred in enforcing such persons rights under this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_.
In the event of any such Indemnified Liability (whether or not asserted before
the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties promptly after
statements therefor are received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified
Party upon request, reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred (
_provided_ that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advance if it is determined by a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such person is
not legally entitled to indemnification under Law).

(b) _Insurance_. The Company shall be permitted to, prior to the Effective
Time, and if the Company fails to do so, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the premium for an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for a period of six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time for events occurring prior to the Effective
Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any
event not less favorable in the aggregate to the intended beneficiaries
thereof than the Companys existing directors and

 



56

    

 officers liability insurance policy. If the Company and the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policy as of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of
at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date of this Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six (6) year period with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date of this
Agreement.

(c) _Successors_. In the event the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, require such
successors, assigns or transferees of the Surviving Corporation or Parent to
assume the obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.09_.

(d) _Continuation_. For not less than six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
ensure that the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or other similar documents) of each Company Subsidiary shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are
currently set forth in the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or the
equivalent organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary. The contractual
indemnification rights, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement
with any of the directors, officers or employees of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation, without
any further action, and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms following the Effective Time.

 

(e) _Benefit_. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_ are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, each
Indemnified Partys heirs, executors or administrators and each Indemnified
Partys representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation and shall not be amended in
a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Parties (including their
successors, assigns and heirs) without the consent of the Indemnified Party
(including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby. 

(f) _Non-Exclusivity_. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_ are
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or
otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement, including this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_, is
intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is
or has been in existence with respect to the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries or the Indemnified Parties, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_ is not prior
to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

 



57

    

Section 5.10 _Takeover Statutes_. The parties hereto shall use all
reasonable efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit the Merger or the
other Transactions and (b) if any Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to
restrict or prohibit any of the foregoing, to take all action reasonably
necessary so that the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize (to the greatest extent practicable)
the effects of such Takeover Statute on such Transactions.

Section 5.11 _Employee Matters_ _._

December 31, 2020 and (ii) twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (the
" _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) to, provide each individual who is an
employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, a " _Company Employee_ ") with (A) a base salary or base
wage rate, as applicable, that is no less than the base salary or base wage
rate as in effect immediately prior to the Closing, (B) annual cash incentive
compensation opportunities that are substantially comparable to the annual
cash incentive compensation opportunities as in effect immediately prior to
the Closing, (C) severance payments and benefits that are substantially
comparable to the severance payments and benefits provided under the Company
Benefits Plans immediately prior to the Closing, and (D) employee benefits
that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to the employee
benefits (other than severance, equity and equity based compensation and
other incentive compensation opportunities) provided immediately prior to the
Closing. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) shall be
obligated to continue to employ any Company Employee for any specific period
of time following the Closing Date, subject to applicable Law.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 5.11(a)_, Parent shall,
or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to,
assume, honor and continue all of the Company Benefit Plans, in each case, in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a
result of the Transactions (either alone or in combination with any other
event).

(c) To the extent that service is relevant for any purpose including
eligibility, benefit accrual and vesting (including, in order to calculate the
amount of any paid time off and leave balance (including vacation and sick
days), gratuities, severance and similar benefits (except, unless required by
applicable Law, not for purposes of defined benefit pension benefit accruals))
under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or
maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) for the benefit of the Company Employees (the "
_Parent Plans_ ") following the Closing Date, such Parent Plan shall credit
such Company Employees for service earned on and prior to the Closing Date
with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and any of their predecessors
(in addition to service earned with Parent or any of Parents affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation) after the Closing Date) to the same
extent such service was recognized under the terms of any analogous Company
Benefit Plan in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or, to the
extent such Parent Plan does not replace an analogous Company Benefit Plan, to
the same extent that an employees service with Parent and any of its
affiliates (including the Company and the Company subsidiaries) is recognized
by the applicable Parent Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need
not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in
any duplication of benefits.

 



58

    

(d) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiary
(including the Surviving Corporation) to, waive any waiting periods and
actively at work or evidence of insurability requirements and any limitations
on eligibility, enrollment and benefits relating to any preexisting medical
conditions of Company Employees and their eligible dependents. Parent shall,
or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to,
maintain or establish, benefit plans that provide for health and welfare
benefits and in which the Company Employees shall be eligible to participate
as of the Closing Date, subject to satisfaction of eligibility provisions and
after taking into account _Section_ __ _ 5.11(c)_. Following the Closing
Date, Parent shall recognize, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) to also recognize, for purposes of annual deductible
and out of pocket limits under its Parent Plans providing health benefits, any
deductible, coinsurance, copayments and out of pocket expenses paid by
such Company Employees and their respective dependents under Company Benefit
Plans in the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs to the extent such
Company Employees participate in any such Parent Plans in such same calendar
year.

 

(e) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) to, maintain or establish a defined contribution plan that is
intended to be tax-qualified (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") and in which the

eligible to participate as of the Closing Date, subject to satisfaction of
eligibility provisions and after taking into account _Section_ __ _ 5.11(c)_.

employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary regarding
the Transactions, (i) the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the
intended communication, (ii) Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to
review and comment on the communication and (iii) the Company shall modify any
such communications to incorporate Parents reasonable comments.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein, expressed
or implied, is intended to or shall be constructed to (i) be treated as an
amendment of any Company Benefit Plan or any other arrangement or create any
rights or obligations except between the parties hereto, (ii) give any
employee, director, independent contractor or former employee or any other
individual associated therewith or any employee benefit plan or trustee
thereof or any other third person any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies to enforce the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ or entitle
any person not a party to this Agreement to assert any claim hereunder, or
(iii) obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their affiliates to
(A) maintain any particular benefit plan or (B) retain the employment of any
particular employee.

contained herein, the Company shall be permitted to take, and shall take, such
actions as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to ensure that the

Section 16 of the Exchange Act pursuant to the Transactions are exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.14 _Defense of Litigation_. The Company shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, notify Parent in writing of any stockholder
litigation or other litigation or Proceedings brought or threatened in writing
against the Company or any of its directors, officers, or representatives
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions. The Company
shall control, and the Company shall, subject to such limitations as counsel
to the Company reasonably determines are necessary to protect any attorney-
client (or similar) privilege of the Company, give Parent a reasonable
opportunity (at Parents expense) to participate in (but not control), and
keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to any material developments
regarding the defense of, any Proceeding brought by stockholders of the
Company or other third party against the Company or its directors, officers

(b) _Company Termination Fee_.

 

(i) If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.01(c)_ or (B) this Agreement is validly terminated by the
Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(d)_, then the Company shall pay the

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent or the Company

any Company Subsidiary enters into a definitive agreement to effect any
Competing Proposal (regardless of when made or the counterparty thereto), or

consummation of such Competing Proposal. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _
7.02(b)(ii)_, all references to "twenty percent (20%)" and "eighty percent

would not enter into this Agreement. In no event shall the Company be required
to pay to Parent more than one (1) Company Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_. In no event shall Parent be required to pay to the
Company (A) more than one (1) Parent Termination Fee pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 7.02(c)_ or (B) the Parent Termination Fee and any other Damages.
Subject to the indemnification and reimbursement obligations specifically set
forth in this Agreement, in the event that Parent receives full payment of
the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_ under
circumstances where a Company Termination Fee was due and payable, the receipt
by Parent of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive
monetary remedy of Parent or Sub against the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
and each such persons respective former, current and future, directors,
managers, officers, employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors, agents,
or other authorized representatives, stockholders, affiliates and assignees
(collectively, but excluding the Company, the " _Company Related Parties_ ")
for any and all losses or Damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Sub, any of
their respective affiliates or any other person in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Merger and the other

 



66

    

 Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis
for such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of an
Intentional Breach by the Company, Parent or Sub shall be permitted to seek
Damages from the Company in excess of the Company Termination Fee. Subject to
the indemnification and reimbursement obligations set forth in the last two
sentences of _Section_ __ _ 5.07(e)_ and the proviso in this sentence and
the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement (subject to the terms
thereof) (the " _Retained Claims_ "), in the event that the Company receives
full payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.02(c)_ under circumstances where a Parent Termination Fee was due and
payable, the receipt by the Company of the Parent Termination Fee shall be the
sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the Company against Parent, Sub, the
Equity Financing Source, the Debt Financing Source and each such persons
respective former, current and future directors, managers, officers,
employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors, agents, other
authorized representatives, stockholders, affiliates and assignees
(collectively, but excluding Parent and Sub, the " _Parent Related Parties_
"), for any and all losses or Damages suffered as a result of the failure of
the Closing to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder
(whether an Intentional Breach or otherwise), and none of Parent, Sub, or any
Parent Related Party shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, and the amount of
the Parent Termination Fee is intended to serve as a cap on the maximum
aggregate liability of Parent, Sub, and the Parent Related Parties in the
event of such a termination for any and all losses or Damages suffered or
incurred by the Company or any of its affiliates or any other person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Merger and
the other Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming
the basis for such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , if Parent fails to
pay the Parent Termination Fee if and when payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.02(c)_ and the Company commences suit that results in a final, non-
appealable judgment against Parent for the payment to the Company of the
Parent Termination Fee, then Parent shall pay the Company its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the Parent Termination
Fee at the prime rate (as published in the Wall Street Journal) in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made through the date of
payment. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that nothing in this _Section_ __ _
7.02_ shall be deemed to affect their respective rights to specific
performance under  _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ (subject to the terms and conditions
set forth therein) in order to specifically enforce this Agreement;
___provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, (1) upon the Companys
acceptance of the Parent Termination Fee under circumstances when it is due
and payable, the Company shall no longer be entitled to seek specific
performance under _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ (other than in respect of the Retained
Claims) and (2) upon Parents acceptance of the Company Termination Fee under
circumstances when it is due and payable, as provided in _Section_ __ _
7.02(b)_, Parent and Sub shall no longer be entitled to seek specific
performance under _Section_ __ _ 8.10_. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that neither (I) any payment of the Parent Termination Fee nor (II) any
payment of the Company Termination Fee, is a penalty but is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that is intended to compensate the Company,
Parent or Sub, as applicable, in the circumstances in which such fees are
payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the case of an Intentional Breach by the Company, Parent or Sub shall
be permitted to seek Damages from the Company in excess of the Company

 



67

    

 Termination Fee and this sentence shall not be deemed to limit any partys
rights under _Section_ __ _ 8.10_. In the event that the Company accepts the
Parent Termination Fee under circumstances when it is due and payable, as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.02(c)_, other than in respect of the Retained
Claims, none of the Company, any Company Subsidiaries or any other person
shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Proceeding against Parent, Sub or
any of the Parent Related Parties or any of their respective affiliates
arising out of this Agreement, any of the Transactions or matters forming the
basis for such termination, and the Company shall cause any such Proceeding
brought by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to be dismissed with
prejudice promptly (or not undertaken, as applicable) and, in any event,
within three (3) Business Days following the acceptance by the Company of the
Parent Termination Fee under circumstances when it is due and payable. In the
event that Parent accepts the Company Termination Fee under circumstances when
it is due and payable, as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_, none of the
Parent or Sub shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Proceeding against
the Company or any of the Company Related Parties or any of their respective
affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of the Transactions or matters
forming the basis for such termination, and Parent shall cause any such
Proceeding brought by Parent or any of its affiliates to be dismissed with
prejudice promptly (or not undertaken, as applicable) and, in any event,
within three (3) Business Days following the acceptance by Parent of the
Company Termination Fee under circumstances when it is due and payable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of an Intentional Breach by the
Company, Parent or Sub shall be permitted to seek Damages from the Company in
excess of the Company Termination Fee.

Section 7.03  _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires
further approval by the stockholders of the Company without the further
approval of such stockholders, (b) no amendment shall be made to this
Agreement after the Effective Time and (c) in the case of any amendments to
or waivers of _Section_ __ _ 7.02(d)_ (solely to the extent that there can be
no recourse after the Parent Termination Fee has been paid-in-full), this
_Section_ __ _ 7.03_, _Section_ __ _ 7.04_, _Section_ __ _ 8.05_, 
_Section_ __ _ 8.08_, _Section_ __ _ 8.10_, or _Section_ __ _ 8.11_ (or any
other provision of this Agreement the amendment or waiver of which has the
effect of modifying such provisions) that are materially adverse to the
interests of the Debt Financing Sources, the Debt Financing Sources party to
any Debt Commitment Letter then in effect. Except as required by Law, no
amendment of this Agreement by the Company shall require the approval of the
stockholders of the Company. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by each of the parties.

 

Section 7.04 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other,
(b) waive any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties of
the other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and
(c) waive compliance by the other with any of the covenants or conditions
contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, there may not be any extension or waiver of
this Agreement that decreases the Merger Consideration or that adversely
affects the rights of the Companys stockholders hereunder without the
approval of the Companys stockholders at a duly convened meeting of the
Companys stockholders called to obtain approval of such extension or waiver.
Any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but such extension
or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

the obligations of any person who has committed to provide Equity Financing

the Guarantee or (ii) prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the Transactions. Any assignment or transfer in violation of

Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

NAVIGANT CONSULTING, INC.

Navigant Consulting, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws
of the State of Delaware (the " _Corporation_ "), hereby certifies as
follows:

1\. The name of the Corporation is Navigant Consulting, Inc. The date
of filing its original Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware was June 6, 1996 (the " _Original Certificate_
"). The Corporation was originally incorporated under the name Metzler
and Associates, Inc.

2\. The Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the " _Certificate_ "),
amends and restates the Restated Certificate of Incorporation that was filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on May 22, 2012 (the "
_Restated Certificate_ "), and was duly adopted in accordance with the
provisions of Sections 242 and 245 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the " _DGCL_ ").

3\. The text of the Restated Certificate is hereby amended and restated in
its entirety to provide as herein set forth in full.

****

 

 _FIRST_ : The name of the Corporation is Navigant Consulting, Inc.

 

 _SECOND_ : The address of the Corporations registered office in the State of
Delaware is Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, County
of New Castle, Delaware 19801. The name of its registered agent at such
address is THE CORPORATION TRUST COMPANY.

 

 _THIRD_ : The nature of the business or the purpose to be conducted or
promoted is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations
may be organized under the DGCL.

_FOURTH_ : The aggregate number of shares of capital stock that the
Corporation shall have authority to issue is 1,000 shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share.

_FIFTH_ :

 

1\. _Liability_. No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to
the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the
directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for
acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct
or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, as the
same exists or hereafter may be amended, or (iv) for any transaction from
which the director derived an improper personal 

   

 benefit. If the DGCL is amended to authorize the further elimination or
limitation of liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the
Corporation, in addition to the limitation on personal liability provided
herein, shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by an amended DGCL.
Any repeal or modification of this Article Fifth by the stockholders of the
Corporation shall be prospective only, and shall not adversely affect any
limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing

2.  _Indemnification_. The Corporation shall:

(a) indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, any person who was
or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending
or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of
the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director
or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or if such person has
previously been designated for indemnification by the resolution of the board
of directors of the Corporation (the " _Board of Directors_ "), an officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation, against expenses (including attorneys
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if
such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation, and,
with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
believe such persons conduct was unlawful. The termination of any
action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon
a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which
such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,
had reasonable cause to believe that such persons conduct was unlawful;

 

(b) indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the
right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the
fact that such person is or was a director or officer, or is or was serving at
the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or if such
person has previously been designated for indemnification by the resolution of
the Board of Directors, an officer, employee or agent of the Corporation,
against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred
by each person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or
suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and
except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or
matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the
Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the
court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon
application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the
circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled
to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other
court shall deem proper;

 



\- 2 -

    

(c) indemnify any director, or, if such person has previously been designated
for indemnification by the resolution of the Board of Directors, an officer,
employee or agent against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, to the extent that
such director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been
successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or
proceeding referred to in Section 2(a) and 2(b) of this Article Fifth, or in
defense of any claim, issue or matter therein;

(d) make any indemnification under Section 2(a) and 2(b) of this Article Fifth
(unless ordered by a court) only as authorized in the specific case upon a
determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent
is proper in the circumstances because such director, officer, employee or
agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 2(a)
and 2(b) of this Article Fifth;

(e) pay expenses incurred by a director or officer in defending a civil
or criminal action, suit or proceeding in advance of the final disposition of
such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf
of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by
the Corporation as authorized in this Section 2 of Article Fifth.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall not be obligated to pay
expenses incurred by a director or officer with respect to any threatened,
pending, or completed claim, suit or action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or otherwise (" _Proceedings_ ") initiated or
brought voluntarily by a director or officer and not by way of defense (other
than Proceedings brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification
under the provisions of this Section 2 of Article Fifth unless a court of
competent jurisdiction determines that each of the material assertions made
by the director or officer in such proceeding were not made in good faith or
were frivolous). The Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify the
director or offer for any amount paid in settlement of a Proceeding covered
hereby without the prior written consent of the Corporation to such
settlement;

(f) not deem the indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by,
or granted pursuant to, the other subsections of this Section 2 of Article
Fifth exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in
such directors or officers official capacity and as to action in another
capacity while holding such office;

(g) have the right, authority and power to purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted
against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or
arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under
the provisions of this Section 2 of Article Fifth;

(h) deem the provisions of this Section 2 of Article Fifth to be a
contract between the Corporation and each director, or appropriately
designated officer, employee or agent who serves in such capacity at any time
while this Section 2 of Article Fifth is in effect and any repeal or
modification of this Section 2 of Article Fifth shall not affect any rights
or obligations then existing with respect to any state of facts then or
theretofore existing or any action, suit or proceeding theretofore or
thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon Such

 



\- 3 -

    

 state of facts. The provisions of this Section 2 of Article Fifth not be
deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and any directors, officers,
employees or agents of any other Corporation (the " _Second Corporation_ ")
which shall merge into or consolidate with this Corporation when this
Corporation shall be the surviving or resulting Corporation, and any such
directors, officers, employees or agents of the Second Corporation shall be
indemnified to the extent required under the DGCL only at the discretion of
the Board of Directors of this Corporation; and

 

(i) continue the indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, this Section 2 of Article Fifth, unless otherwise
provided when authorized or ratified, as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation and such rights shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a
person. 

_SIXTH_ : Except as may be expressly provided in this Certificate, the
Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend,
alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate, and any
other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time
in force may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter
prescribed herein or by applicable law, and all rights, preferences and
privileges of whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any
other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Certificate in its present
form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in
this Article Sixth; _provided_ , _however_ , that any amendment or repeal of
Article Sixth of this Certificate shall not adversely affect any right or
protection existing thereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring
prior to such amendment or repeal.
