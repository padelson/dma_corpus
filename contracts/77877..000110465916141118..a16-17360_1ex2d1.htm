"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution of
stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code
(A) in the two years prior to the date of this Agreement, or (B) in a
distribution that could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of
related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) that
includes the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(vii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into or has

obligation to make any payments to any Person (other than Buyer or any of its
Affiliates) after the Closing.

 



 

(x) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) this
_Section 3.2(j)_ and _Sections 3.1(e)_ and _3.2(k)_ are the sole
representations or warranties of the Company and Sellers with respect to Tax
matters, and nothing in these sections shall cause Sellers to be liable for
any Taxes for which Sellers are not expressly liable pursuant to _ARTICLE VI_
(relating to Tax matters), (ii) Sellers and the Company make no
representations or warranties, and provide no other assurance, with respect to
the amount of any Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with
respect to the availability of any Tax Attributes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on and after the Closing Date, and (iii) Sellers shall have no

complete list of each Employee Plan.

 



 

(ii) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.2(k)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no Company Plan is an "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA).

 



 

(iii) With respect to each Company Plan, the Company Group has delivered or
made available to Buyer or its representatives true and complete copies of the
following materials, to the extent applicable: (A) all current plan documents
for each Company Plan or, in the case of an unwritten Company Plan, a written
description thereof, (B) current summary plan descriptions, summaries of
modifications, annual reports, and summary annual reports with respect to any
Company Plan, (C) current trust agreements, insurance contracts, and other
documents relating to the funding or payment of benefits under any Company
Plan, and (D) any other documents, forms or other instruments relating to any
Company Plan reasonably requested by Buyer. With respect to each Insperity
Plan, the Company Group has delivered or made

       
 

 



 

available to Buyer or its representatives copies of such plan or a summary
plan description or other summary of material terms to the extent it has such
documentation, and the Company Group has requested copies of such plan
documentation from Insperity if it does not have such documentation.

 



 

(iv) The Company Group has complied in all material respects with its
obligations under the Insperity Agreement and the Employee Plans and timely
made all payments or other contributions required thereunder.

 



 

(v) Each Company Plan and, to the knowledge of Sellers, each Insperity Plan
and the administration thereof complies in all material respects with its
terms and applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code, including, but not
limited to, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended
by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, and the
regulations and related guidance promulgated thereunder. The Company Group
does not owe a penalty or assessable payment for 2015 under Section 4980H of
the Code and does not reasonably expect to owe any such penalty or assessable
payment for 2016. Each Company Plan and, to the knowledge of Sellers, each
Insperity Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code is either the recipient of the most recently
favorable "on-cycle" favorable determination letter from the IRS or is the
subject of an opinion letter from the IRS as to which the adopter is entitled
to rely as to the qualified status of such plan under Section 401(a) of the
Code, as provided in Revenue Procedures 2011-49, and no amendment has been
made nor has any event occurred with respect to any such Employee Plan which
would reasonably be expected to cause the loss or denial of such qualification
under Code Section 401(a); additionally, each trust created under any such
Company Plan or, to the knowledge of Sellers, any such Insperity Plan, is
exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, and nothing has
occurred that has or could reasonably be expected to adversely affect such
exemption. Neither the Company Group nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has
sponsored or contributed to or been required to contribute to any (A) defined
benefit plan, as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA, that is subject to Title
IV of ERISA, (B) "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA), or (C) plan subject to the minimum funding standards under Section 302
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and neither the Company Group nor any of
its ERISA Affiliates has ever contributed to, or ever been obligated to
contribute to any such plan. No Insperity Plan is an "employee benefit plan"
subject to Title IV of ERISA. No proceedings or claims (other than routine
claims for benefits) are pending or, to the knowledge of Sellers, threatened,
against any Company Plan. No audit or examination by a Governmental Body is
pending or, to the knowledge of Sellers, threatened, with respect to any
Company Plan, nor has notice been received of a potential audit or examination
of such a plan by a Governmental Body. To the knowledge of Sellers, no
proceedings or claims (other than routine claims for benefits) are pending or
threatened against any Insperity Plan. To the knowledge of Sellers, no audit
or examination by a Governmental Body is pending or threatened with respect to
any Insperity Plan, nor has notice been received of a potential audit or
examination of such a plan by a Governmental Body. No matters are pending with
respect to a Company Plan or, to the knowledge of Sellers, an Insperity Plan,
under the Internal Revenue Service Voluntary Correction Program, Audit Closing
Agreement Program or similar programs.

      
 

 



 

(vi) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.2(k)(vi)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or with respect to any arrangement entered into or established by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, neither the execution of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either
alone or upon the occurrence of another event) will (A) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due, to any current
or former employee, co-employee, director or independent contractor of the
Company or any of its Affiliates; (B) result in any payment (including
severance, change in control or otherwise) becoming due to any employee, co-
employee, director or independent contractor of the Company or any of its
Affiliates under any Company Plan or, to the knowledge of Sellers, any
Insperity Plan; or (C) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any
Company Plan or, to the knowledge of Sellers, any Insperity Plan.

 



 

(vii) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.2(k)(vii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, either on their own or in combination with any other event, will
give rise to the payment of any amount to a service provider or a receipt of
any benefit by a service provider that would not be deductible by the Company
or any Affiliate by reason of Section 280G of the Code or that would give rise
to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. Each Employee Plan that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A
of the Code (A) complies in form with Section 409A of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, and (B)
does not benefit a service provider (as defined in such Treasury Regulations)
who is subject to additional Taxes under Section 409A of the Code as a result
of participation in such Employee Plan. The Company is not a party to, or
otherwise obligated under, any Contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that
provides for a Tax "gross-up" or similar "make-whole" payments to any Person.

 



 

(viii) (A) Each Company Plan is amendable and terminable unilaterally by the
Company at any time without liability or expense as a result thereof (other
than for benefits accrued through the date of termination or amendment and
reasonable administrative expenses related thereto), (B) to the knowledge of
Sellers, the Companys participation in the Insperity Plan is amendable and
terminable unilaterally by the Company at any time without liability or
expense as a result thereof (other than for benefits accrued through the date
of termination or amendment and reasonable administrative expenses related
thereto), and (C) no Company Plan or, to the knowledge of Sellers, Insperity
Plan document or agreement, summary plan description or other written
communication distributed generally to employees by its terms prohibits the
Company from amending or terminating any such Company Plan, or from amending
or terminating its participation in any such Insperity Plan, or in any way
limits such action. The investment vehicles used to fund any Company Plan and,
to the knowledge of Sellers, any Insperity Plan may be changed at any time
without incurring a sales charge, surrender fee or similar expense. No event
has occurred, nor to the knowledge of Sellers, do circumstances exist that
could reasonably be expected to result in a material increase in the premium
of any Company Plan or, to the knowledge of Sellers, any Insperity Plan.

 



 

(ix) No Company Plan or, to the knowledge of Sellers, no Insperity Plan
promises or provides retiree medical, health or life insurance or other
retiree welfare benefits to any Person, except as may be required by the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (" **
_COBRA_** "), or other applicable Law, and there has been no

      
 

 



 

communication (whether oral or written) by the Company or, to the knowledge of
Sellers, Insperity to any Person that could reasonably be expected to promise
or guarantee any such retiree medical, health or life insurance or other
retiree welfare benefits, except to the extent required by COBRA or other
applicable Law.

 



 

(x) With respect to each Employee Plan that is a group health plan within the
meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code or similar state law, the Company,
with respect to each such Company Plan, or Insperity, to the knowledge of
Sellers, with respect to each Insperity Plan, is currently in compliance with
and has always complied with the applicable continuation requirements for its
welfare benefit plans, including COBRA, and no event has occurred with respect
to each such Company Plan or, to the knowledge of Sellers, each such Insperity
Plan and, to the knowledge of Sellers, no circumstance exists under which
Buyer may reasonably be expected to incur any liability, direct or indirect,
under the provisions of COBRA or which has resulted or could result in the
imposition of a lien upon any of the assets of Company, its Subsidiaries or
Buyer.

 



 

(xi) There are no Company Plans that are not subject to United States Law, and
no employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who provides services
primarily outside of the United States participates in any Company Plan or, to
the knowledge of Sellers, any Insperity Plan.

 



 

(l) _Reserve Reports_. The Company has delivered or made available to Buyer
true and correct copies of all reports (" ** _Company Reserve Reports_** ")
requested or commissioned by the Company or its Subsidiaries and delivered to
the Company or its Subsidiaries in writing estimating the Companys and its
Subsidiaries proved oil and gas reserves prepared by any unaffiliated Person
(" ** _Report Preparers_** "), including the Company Reserve Report prepared
by Cawley, Gillespie and Associates relating to the Company interests referred
to therein as of December 31, 2015. The factual, non-interpretive data
supplied to each Report Preparer, by or on behalf of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, that was material to such firms estimates of proved oil and gas
reserves attributable to the oil and gas properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries was, as of the time provided (or as modified or amended prior to
the issuance of the applicable Company Reserve Report), accurate, and the
Company has no knowledge of any material errors in the assumptions and
estimates provided by the Company to any Report Preparer. The oil and gas
reserve estimates of the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to each Report
Preparer fairly reflect, in all material respects, the oil and gas reserves of
the Company and its Subsidiaries at the dates indicated therein. Except for
changes generally affecting the oil and gas exploration, development and
production industry (including changes in commodity prices) and normal
depletion by production, there has been no change in respect of the matters
addressed in the Company Reserve Reports that has had or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

or any of its Subsidiaries is being used or enforced in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to result in the abandonment, cancellation or
unenforceability of such Intellectual Property; and (E) _Schedule

interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company Group or its Affiliates.

      
 

 



 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, prior to Closing, no Tax information shall be
required to be provided to Buyer under this _Section 4.8_ if the provision of
such information may result in a waiver of any legal privilege.

but in no event later than 15 Business Days following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, file with the United States Federal Trade

the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other

(a) During the Interim Period, upon the request of Buyer, the Company Group

_provided_ that the documents in respect of such arrangements contemplated by
this clause (xi) shall not need to be effective until the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) none of Sellers, the Company Group nor
any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to incur any liability
in connection with the Financing (including commitment, underwriting or
similar fees), (ii) nothing shall require such

       
 

 



 

cooperation to the extent it would require any Seller or member of the Company
Group to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement and (iii) neither Sellers,

Person reasonably determines that such action, access or disclosure would (A)

contravention of any applicable requirements of Law or (C) require the board
of directors (or similar governing body) of any Seller or the Company Group or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to approve any Financing or agreements

Group, reimburse Sellers and the Company Group and their respective
Subsidiaries, as applicable, for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred
by Sellers or the Company Group or their respective Subsidiaries in connection
with this _Section 4.10_.

 



 

(c) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that its obtaining Financing is not a
condition to any of its obligations hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, if
any Financing referred to in this _Section 4.10_ is not obtained for any
reason other than Sellers material breach of its obligations hereunder, Buyer
shall continue to be obligated to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, subject to and on the terms contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.11 _Termination of Affiliate Obligations_. On or before the Closing
Date, except as set forth on _Schedule 4.11_ , all obligations between the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and one or more
of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, including any and all
contracts (other than this Agreement and any ancillary agreement contemplated
hereby) between any of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and one or more of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, shall
be terminated without any obligation on the part of the Company or its
Subsidiaries from and after the Closing.

 



 

Section 4.12 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall have the opportunity to interview the Company Group employees
for post-Closing employment opportunities with the Company Group during normal
working hours (including onsite interviews) consistent with the operating
requirements of the Company Group and applicable Law. Additionally, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, Buyer may review and retain copies of
personnel records maintained by the Company Group or Sellers with respect to
the Company Group employees. No later than ten Business Days prior to the
Closing, Buyer shall provide Sellers Representative with a list of the
Company Group employees who will be terminated by the Company Group on or
before the Closing Date. Sellers shall cause the Company Group to terminate
all such employees prior to Closing. Sellers shall pay all costs associated
with their termination, including, but not limited to any severance
obligations under the Employee Plans. All Company Group employees who are not
included on such list shall continue employment with the Company Group on and
after Closing (each a " ** _Retained Employee_** "). Nothing in this Agreement
shall create any obligation on the part of Buyer to continue the employment of
any Retained Employee for any definite period following the Closing Date, and
nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Buyer from altering, amending, or
terminating any Employee Plan, or the participation of any of its employees in
such plans, at any time.

      
 

 



 

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date and contingent upon Closing, the Company
Group shall terminate any Employee Plan intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code (each, a " ** _401(k) Plan_**") or meet the requirements
of Section 125 of the Code (each a " ** _125 Plan_** ") and has requested that
Insperity terminate any such Insperity Plan with respect to the portion of
each such plan that is attributable to Company Group employees. The Company
Group will provide Buyer with evidence that the portion of each Employee Plan
that is a 401(k) Plan or a 125 Plan that is attributable to Company Group
employees has been terminated and that the participation of each Company Group
employee in each such 401(k) Plan and 125 Plan has been terminated, as
applicable, effective as of the Closing Date and contingent upon Closing,
pursuant to any related Insperity notice requirement and resolutions of the
board of directors (or similar governing body) of the Company Group. The form
and substance of such notice and resolutions shall be reviewed by Buyer and
revised based on the reasonable requests of Buyer. The Company Group also
shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating the portion of
each such 401(k) Plan and 125 Plan that is attributable to Company Group
employees as Buyer may reasonably require.

 



 

(c) The Company Group shall terminate all contracts with Insperity providing
for the co-employment of employees of the Company Group, effective as of the
Closing Date and contingent upon Closing, including sending all required
notices, such that (i) each such contract shall be of no further force or
effect upon Closing, without any remaining Liability of any kind on the part
of the Company Group or Buyer, (ii) effective as of the Closing Date and
contingent upon Closing, any Company Group employee shall be considered solely
an employee of the Company Group for all purposes, and (iii) each Company
Group employees participation in any Employee Plans sponsored by Insperity
shall terminate effective as of the Closing Date, contingent upon Closing.

 



 

(d) Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that each Retained Employee shall receive full credit for
such employees service with the Company Group and any of its predecessors for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals, under any Buyer or
Company Group employee benefit plans (other than (A) benefit accrual under a
buyer employee benefit plan subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of
ERISA, and (B) vesting under any Buyer stock plan or Buyer incentive plan) in
which any such Retained Employee participates, to the same extent recognized
by the Company Group on and before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. Sellers shall promptly provide Buyer with all data and information
reasonably requested by Buyer to provide the Retained Employees with such
service credit.

 



 

(e) Sellers shall be responsible, either directly or through insurance
policies maintained by Sellers or Insperity, for all (i) medical, vision,
dental and prescription drug claims for expenses incurred by any Retained
Employee or his or her dependents, (ii) claims for short-term and long-term
disability income benefits incurred by any Retained Employee, and (iii) claims
for group life, travel and accident, and accidental death and dismemberment
insurance benefits incurred by any Retained Employee, in each case, prior to
the Closing. Buyer shall be, responsible for all (A) medical, vision, dental
and prescription drug claims for expenses incurred by any Retained Employee or
his or her dependents, (B) claims for short-term and long-term disability
income benefits incurred by any Retained Employee and (C)

      
 

 



 

claims for group life, travel and accident, and accidental death and
dismemberment insurance benefits incurred by any Retained Employee, in each
case, on or after Closing. Except in the event of any claim for workers
compensation benefits, for purposes of this Agreement, the following claims
and Liabilities shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (1) medical,
vision, dental and/or prescription drug benefits (including hospital
expenses), upon provision of the services, materials or supplies comprising
any such benefits and (2) short- and long-term disability, life, accidental
death and dismemberment and business travel accident insurance benefits, upon
the death, illness, injury or accident giving rise to such benefits. Sellers
shall be responsible for all claims for workers compensation benefits that are
incurred prior to Closing by any Retained Employee. Buyer shall be responsible
for all claims for workers compensation benefits that are incurred on or after
the Closing by any Retained Employee. A claim for workers compensation
benefits shall be deemed to be incurred when the event giving rise to the
claim occurs.

 



 

(f) Buyer shall take all actions necessary to provide COBRA continuation
coverage to all individuals who are MandA Qualified Beneficiaries (within the
meaning assigned to such term under QandA-4 of Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980B-9) with respect to the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
for the duration of the period to which such individuals are entitled to such
coverage, subject to such beneficiaries paying their premiums under COBRA.

 



 

(g) Complete copies of the personnel records of all Retained Employees shall
continue to be Company Group property on and after the Closing Date.

 



 

(h) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer on any entity or
individual who is not a party to this Agreement any rights whatsoever. This
_Section 4.12_ shall not constitute an amendment to any employee benefit plan
maintained by Buyer or any Seller, create any third party beneficiary rights,
or inure to the benefit of or be enforceable by, any employee or any person
representing the interests of employees.

 



 

Section 4.13 _Pay Off Letters; Release of Indebtedness_. Sellers will request
each holder of Indebtedness set forth on _Schedule 4.13_ to prepare and
deliver to Buyer the Pay Off Letters, no later than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, setting forth (i) the amounts required to be paid
at the Closing to the holder of such Indebtedness pursuant to the terms of
such Indebtedness and (ii) the commitment of such creditor to release all
liens, if any, which they may hold on any of the Assets immediately upon
receipt of all payments validly owing to each holder of Indebtedness as
provided for in the Pay Off Letters, which Pay Off Letters will be updated, as
necessary, prior to the Closing Date. At the Closing, Sellers shall also
provide Buyer evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that upon payment of
the amounts set forth in the Pay Off Letters, all liens on the Subject Oil and
Gas Interests and the Assets securing the Indebtedness covered by the Pay Off
Letters will be removed and released. No Seller will have liability in respect
of the Pay Off Letters for Indebtedness under the Company Credit Facility or
the satisfaction of the Indebtedness covered thereby. Sellers and the Company
will also, to the extent requested to do so by Buyer, use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in procuring the novation of Buyer
for the Company under any Company Hedge Contracts that may be outstanding as
of the Closing Date.

      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE V** ** 
EXAMINATION OF TITLE AND PROPERTIES**

 



 

Section 5.1 _Access_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Execution Date until 5:00 p.m., Central time, on
November 7, 2016 (the " ** _Defect Deadline_** "), Sellers and the Company
Group shall give Buyer (and any of its Representatives) reasonable access to
the Properties (including the Records in the Company Groups possession), as
well as to Sellers personnel, if any, that work primarily on the Properties,
and to the Company Groups personnel, solely for the purpose of Buyers due
diligence investigation of the Properties, but only to the extent that Sellers
and the Company Group may do so without violating any confidentiality or other
obligations to any third Person and only to the extent that Sellers and the
Company Group have the authority to grant such access without breaching any
obligation or restriction binding on Sellers or the Company Group, or any of
their respective Affiliates. Such access by Buyer shall be limited to the
Company Groups normal business hours, and Buyers investigation shall be
conducted in a manner that minimizes interference with the operation of the
Properties and at the sole cost and expense of Buyer.

 



 

(b) Buyer acknowledges that the permission of the operator (if other than any
member of the Company Group) or another third Person may be required before
Buyer will be able to inspect portions of the Properties and that such
permission must be obtained prior to the inspection of such portions. Sellers
and the Company Group shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
permission for Buyer upon Buyers written request. All inspections pursuant to
this _Section 5.1_ shall be conducted at Buyers sole cost, risk and expense,
and any conclusions made from any such investigation done by Buyer or any of
Buyers Representatives shall result from Buyers own independent review and
judgment. Buyer agrees to comply with (and to cause Buyers Representatives to
comply with) the rules, regulations and instructions issued by Sellers, the
Company Group or any third party operator of the Properties regarding the
actions of Buyer (and Buyers Representatives) in conducting any inspection
pursuant to this _Section 5.1_.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Environmental Property Inspection_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Execution Date, Sellers and the Company Group shall
permit Buyer and Buyers Representatives, at Buyers sole risk, cost and
expense, reasonable access to the Properties operated by the Company Group,
and to Properties operated by any third-party operator (to the extent Sellers
have obtained such operators approval for such access, which Sellers shall
use reasonable efforts to obtain upon Buyers written request), to conduct
field inspections for purposes of Buyers due diligence investigation of
environmental matters relating to the Properties (" ** _Buyer s Environmental
Review_**"). In connection with the granting of such access, and except to the
extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any member of
the Seller Indemnified Parties, Buyer agrees that Buyer shall be liable to
Sellers and to the Company Group for any and all damage to the Properties
arising out of or relating to Buyers (or Buyers Representatives) inspection
and access to the Properties. Buyer shall, and shall cause Buyers
Representatives to, abide by Sellers and the Company Groups (or any of their
respective Affiliates) safety rules, regulations and operating policies of
which they are

      
 

 



 

informed in writing prior to conducting Buyers Environmental Review. The
scope of work comprising Buyers Environmental Review shall be limited to
Phase I Activities; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , in the event that Buyers
environmental consultant conducting the Phase I Activities reasonably
concludes, based upon the results of the Phase I Activities, that it is
necessary to conduct a Phase II Environmental Assessment on certain Properties
in order for Buyer to fully assess the environmental condition of the
Properties, ascertain the existence of an Environmental Defect, or the
Environmental Defect Amount, Buyer may, with Sellers Representatives prior
written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed, conduct such Phase II Environmental Assessment as to those specific
Properties. If Sellers Representative denies such consent for any reason, all
Properties subject to such request, and all associated Properties, will be
deemed uncured Environmental Defect Properties (such Properties are the " **
_Environmental Review Defect Properties_** ") and the Base Purchase Price will
be reduced by the Allocated Values of all such Properties. Buyer shall (i)
consult with Sellers Representative before conducting any work comprising
Buyers Environmental Review, (ii) perform its work in conducting Buyers
Environmental Review in a safe and workmanlike manner and so as to not
unreasonably interfere with Sellers or the Company Groups (or any of their
respective Affiliates) operations, (iii) comply with all applicable Laws, and
(iv) reasonably promptly and completely restore the Properties to the
condition such Properties existed in prior to the Buyers Environmental Review
and repair any damage thereto resulting from Buyers Environmental Review.
Sellers and the Company Group shall have the right to have one or more
representatives accompany Buyer at all times during Buyers Environmental
Review, and Buyer shall give Sellers Representative at least forty-eight (48)
hours notice prior to the start of its work on the Properties, unless
Sellers Representative waives such requirement. The Parties agree that all
information discovered during Buyers Environmental Review shall be governed
by the terms of the Seller Confidentiality Agreement (except to the extent
such information is required to be provided under this Agreement (e.g., to an
Arbitrator pursuant to _ARTICLE XI_)).

 



 

(b) BUYER SHALL DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES, FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES ARISING OUT OF, RESULTING
FROM, BASED ON, ASSOCIATED WITH, OR RELATING TO, IN ANY WAY, THE ACCESS
AFFORDED TO BUYER PURSUANT TO THIS _ARTICLE V_, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH
LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, SOLELY OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE,
PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT
OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, EXCEPTING
ONLY LIABILITIES TO THE EXTENT RESULTING FROM THE WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OF ANY OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES. THE FOREGOING INDEMNITY
SHALL CONTINUE IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT NOTWITHSTANDING ANY TERMINATION OF
THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

Section 5.3 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for (a) the special warranty of title
set forth in _Section 3.2(m)_ and (b) the Companys representations and
warranties under _Sections 3.2(o)_ and _3.2(kk)_ of this Agreement (clauses
(a) and (b) are, collectively, the " ** _Limited Representations_** "), the
rights and remedies of Buyer set forth in this _ARTICLE V_ shall be Buyers
exclusive rights and remedies with respect to any defect of title (including
any Title Defect), any Environmental

      
 

 



 

Defect and any Environmental Liability with respect to the Properties, and the
provisions of _ARTICLE X_ shall not apply with respect to any defect in title
(including any Title Defect), Environmental Defect or Environmental Liability.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Notice of Title Defects and Title Benefits; Remedies_.

 



 

(a) If Sellers discover any Title Benefit, or Buyer discovers any Title
Defect, then such Party may (but shall have no obligation to) deliver to the
other Party, prior to the Defect Deadline, a Title Notice with respect to such
Title Benefit or Title Defect, as applicable. Except for the Limited
Representations, Sellers and Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and neither
Buyer nor Sellers, respectively, shall have any liability for, any Title
Benefit or Title Defect for which Buyer or Sellers, respectively, has not
received a proper Title Notice on or before the Defect Deadline. For the
avoidance of doubt and except for the Limited Representations, if Buyer or
Sellers fail to provide a Title Notice which satisfies the requirements set
forth in the definition of Title Notice, then the relevant Title Defect(s) or
Title Benefit(s), as the case may be, shall be deemed waived.

 



 

(b) With respect to each Listed Interest for which Buyer has asserted a Title
Defect pursuant to a Title Notice (each such Listed Interest, a " ** _Title
Defect Property_** ") that Sellers have not cured (and Buyer has not elected
to waive in writing) on or before one (1) day prior to Closing (the " **
_Defect Response Date_** "), unless a Party chooses to submit a Disputed Title
Matter for arbitration pursuant to _ARTICLE XI_, the Base Purchase Price will
be reduced by the aggregate Title Defect Amounts for all such Title Defect
Properties (the aggregate amount is the " ** _TD Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount_** ").

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no event
shall there be any remedies provided by Sellers (other than with respect to
the special warranty of title set forth in _Section 3.2(m)_), and Sellers
shall not be responsible for, (i) any individual Title Defect for which the
Title Defect Amount does not exceed $50,000 (the " ** _Title Threshold_** ")
and (ii) any Title Defect with respect to which the Title Defect Amount
exceeds the Title Threshold, unless and until the aggregate of all such Title
Defect Amounts that exceed the Title Threshold (excluding any Title Defect
Amounts attributable to Title Defects that are cured by Sellers pursuant to
_Section 5.4(b)_), exceeds an amount equal to $11,485,269.75 (the " ** _Title
Deductible_** "), and then only with respect to the amount of such Title
Defect Amounts that exceed the Title Deductible; _provided_ , _however_ , the
Title Threshold and Title Deductible will not apply to any Title Defects
caused by or created by, through, or under the Company Group prior to the
Closing Date.

 



 

(d) With respect to each Lease or Well for which Sellers have asserted a Title
Benefit pursuant to a Title Notice, the aggregate of the Title Benefit Amounts
shall be offset against any Base Purchase Price reduction due to Title Defects
and shall not cause any increase in the Base Purchase Price, it being
understood the calculation of the aggregate TD Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount shall be net of such aggregate Title Benefit Amounts; _provided_ ,
_however_ , in no event shall there be any offset against the aggregate TD
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount provided by Sellers for any individual Title
Benefit in a Lease or Well for which the aggregate Title Benefit Value of all
Title Benefits with respect to such Lease or Well does not exceed the Title
Threshold or the Title Deductible.

      
 

 



 

Section 5.5 _Title Defect Amount; Title Benefit Amount_.

 



 

(a) The amount by which the Allocated Value of any Listed Interest is reduced
as a result of the existence of a Title Defect with respect thereto is the "
** _Title Defect Amount_** ", which shall be determined in accordance with the
following methodology, terms and conditions:

 



 

(i) if Buyer and Sellers Representative agree on the Title Defect Amount,
then such amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 



 

(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien or encumbrance that is undisputed and
liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be equal to the
amount necessary to be paid to remove such encumbrance from the Listed
Interest;

 



 

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a decrease in (A) the actual Net Revenue
Interest for any Well or Lease, with respect to the Target Depth for such Well
or Lease, below (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated on _Exhibit C_ for such
Well or Lease (and there is a corresponding decrease in the Working Interest
for such Well or Lease below the Working Interest stated on _Exhibit C_ with
respect to the Target Depth for such Well or Lease), then the Title Defect
Amount shall be the product of (y) the Allocated Value of such Well or Lease
_multiplied by_ (z) one (1), _minus_ a fraction, the numerator of which is the
actual Net Revenue Interest for such Well or Lease, with respect to the Target
Depth for such Well or Lease, and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest for such Well or Lease stated on _Exhibit C_;

 



 

(iv) if the Title Defect represents a decrease in (A) the actual Net Mineral
Acres covered by a Lease (with respect to all of any Target Depth for such
Lease) below (B) the Net Mineral Acres for such Target Depth for such Lease
stated on _Exhibit C_, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of
(x) the Allocated Value of such Lease for such Target Depth multiplied by (y)
one (1), minus a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual Net Mineral
Acres covered by such Lease (with respect to all of such Target Depth for such
Lease) and the denominator of which is the Net Mineral Acres for such Target
Depth for such Lease stated on _Exhibit C_;

 



 

(v) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or encumbrance upon, or other
defect in title to, the Listed Interest of a type not described above
(including in the event a Title Defect affects some, but not all, of the
associated Target Depth), the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by
taking into account the Allocated Value of such Listed Interest, the portion
of such Listed Interest affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the
Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life
of such Listed Interest, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and
Sellers Representative and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to
make a proper evaluation;

 



 

(vi) the Title Defect Amount with respect to any Listed Interest shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

 



 

(vii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any
Listed Interest shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Listed Interest.

      
 

 



 

(b) The amount by which the Allocated Value of any Listed Interest is
increased as a result of the existence of a Title Benefit with respect thereto
is the " ** _Title Benefit Amount_** ", which shall be determined in
accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:

 



 

(i) if Buyer and Sellers Representative agree on the Title Benefit Amount,
then such amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

 



 

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents an increase in (A) the actual Net Revenue
Interest for any Well or Lease, with respect to the Target Depth for such Well
or Lease, over (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated on _Exhibit C_ for such
Well or Lease (and there is a corresponding increase in the Working Interest
for such Well or Lease above the Working Interest stated on _Exhibit C_ with
respect to the Target Depth for such Well or Lease), then the Title Benefit
Amount shall be the product of (y) the Allocated Value of such Well or Lease
_multiplied by_ (z) the result obtained by subtracting one (1) from a
fraction, the numerator of which is the actual Net Revenue Interest for such
Well or Lease, with respect to the Target Depth for such Well or Lease, and
the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest for such Well or Lease
stated on _Exhibit C_;

 



 

(iii) if the Title Benefit represents an increase in (A) the actual Net
Mineral Acres covered by a Lease (with respect all of any Target Depth for
such Lease) above (B) the Net Mineral Acres for such Target Depth for such
Lease stated on _Exhibit C_, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the
product of (x) the Allocated Value of such Lease for such Target Depth
multiplied by (y) the result obtained by subtracting one (1) from a fraction,
the numerator of which is the actual Net Mineral Acres covered by such Lease
(with respect to all of such Target Depth for such Lease) and the denominator
of which is the Net Mineral Acres for such Target Depth for such Lease stated
on _Exhibit C_; and

 



 

(iv) if the Title Benefit Amount cannot be calculated pursuant to subsections
(i), (ii) or (iii) (including in the event a Title Benefit affects some, but
not all, of the associated Target Depth), then the Title Benefit Amount shall
be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Listed
Interest, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential economic effect
of the Title Benefit over the life of the Listed Interest, the values placed
upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and Sellers Representative and such other
reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Notice of Environmental Defects; Remedies_.

 



 

(a) If Buyer discovers any Environmental Defect, then Buyer may (but shall
have no obligation to) deliver to Sellers Representative, prior to the Defect
Deadline, an Environmental Notice with respect to such Environmental Defect.
Except for the Companys representations and warranties in _Sections 3.2(o)_
and _3.2(kk)_ of this Agreement, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and
Sellers shall have no liability for, any Environmental Defect for which
Sellers Representative has not received an Environmental Notice on or before
the Defect Deadline. Except for the Companys representations and warranties
in _Sections 3.2(o)_ and _3.2(kk)_ of this Agreement, for the avoidance of
doubt, if Buyer fails to provide an Environmental Notice which satisfies the
requirements set forth in the definition of Environmental Notice, then the
relevant Environmental Defect(s) shall be deemed waived.

      
 

 



 

(b) With respect to each Property for which Buyer has asserted an
Environmental Defect pursuant to an Environmental Notice (each such Property,
an " ** _Environmental Defect Property_** ") that Sellers have not cured (and
Buyer has not elected to waive in writing) on or before the Defect Response
Date, unless a Party chooses to submit a Disputed Environmental Matter to
arbitration pursuant to _ARTICLE XI_, Sellers and Buyer shall elect by mutual
agreement prior to Closing one of the following options with respect to such
Environmental Defect:

 



 

(i) reduce the Base Purchase Price by the Environmental Defect Amount
attributable to such Environmental Defect Properties (the aggregate amount of
all such reductions to the Base Purchase Price under this _Section
5.6(b)(i)_, the " ** _ED Purchase Price Adjustment Amount_** "); or

 



 

(ii) have Sellers indemnify Buyer against all Liabilities resulting from such
Environmental Defect and associated remediation pursuant to an indemnity
agreement mutually agreed by the Parties (each, an " ** _Environmental
Indemnity Agreement_** ").

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no event
shall there be any remedies provided by Sellers, and Sellers shall not be
responsible for, (i) any individual Environmental Defect for which the
Environmental Defect Amount does not exceed $50,000 (the " ** _Environmental
Threshold_** ") and (ii) any Environmental Defect with respect to which the
Environmental Defect Amount exceeds the Environmental Threshold, unless and
until the aggregate of all such Environmental Defect Amounts that exceed the
Environmental Threshold (excluding the amount of Environmental Defect Amounts
attributable to Environmental Defects that are cured by Sellers pursuant to
_Section 5.6(b)_), exceeds an amount equal to $11,485,269.75 (the " **
_Environmental Deductible_** "), and then only with respect to the amount of
such Environmental Defect Amounts that exceed the Environmental Deductible.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Title and Environmental Dispute Resolution_. If, as of the
Closing Date, the Parties cannot agree upon (i) the existence of a Title
Defect or Title Benefit, the adequacy of a Title Notice, the adequacy of any
Title Defect curative materials submitted to Buyer, the Title Defect Amount
with respect to any Title Defect or the Title Benefit Amount with respect to
any Title Benefit (each, a " ** _Disputed Title Matter_** ") or (ii) the
existence of an Environmental Defect, the adequacy of an Environmental Notice,
the adequacy of any Environmental Defect curative actions taken by Sellers, or
the Environmental Defect Amount with respect to any Environmental Defect
(each, a " ** _Disputed Environmental Matter_** " and, together with any
Disputed Title Matter, a " ** _Disputed Matter_** "), then, in each case, the
Disputed Matter shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the
provisions of _ARTICLE XI_.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Casualty Loss and Condemnation_. If, during the Interim Period,
all or any portion of the Properties are destroyed or damaged by fire, flood,
earthquake, windstorm, theft, vandalism, explosion, blowout, riot, sabotage,
accident or other casualty of a similar nature or shall be taken by
condemnation or under the right of eminent domain (each, a " ** _Casualty
Loss_** "; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such event that occurs in
connection with any action taken pursuant to the Capital Budget or otherwise
requested or approved by Buyer in accordance with this Agreement will not be
considered a " ** _Casualty Loss_** " for any purpose hereunder), and the
value of such Casualty Losses, individually or in the aggregate, exceeds
$200,000, then Buyer will be

      
 

 



 

required to close, and Sellers Representative may elect (a) to cause the
Properties affected by any casualty or taking to be repaired or restored to at
least their condition prior to such casualty, at Sellers sole cost, as
promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend beyond the Closing
Date), or (b) reduce the Purchase Price by the "reduction in value" to the
affected Properties caused by such Casualty Losses (taking into account any
Tax benefit as a result of such Casualty Losses); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such "reduction in value" shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the
Allocated Value, if any, of the affected Properties and (ii) an amount
mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Sellers Representative as the reasonable
cost of repair of such Property.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Consents_. No later than 5:00 pm Central time on the date 10
Business Days after the Execution Date, Sellers Representative shall deliver
notices to the applicable Persons holding Consents requesting that the holders
of such Consents (other than Customary Post-Closing Consents) grant their
consent, in accordance with the applicable agreements and contracts creating
such Consents. Sellers shall, prior to the Closing, at Sellers expense,
procure all Consents (other than Customary Post-Closing Consents) necessary to
transfer the Company Capital Stock to Buyer other than HSR.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI** ** 
TAX MATTERS**

 



 

Section 6.1 _Liability for Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Each Seller (severally and not jointly) shall be liable for and defend and
hold Buyer harmless from, its Pro Rata Portion of Seller Taxes. Sellers shall
be entitled to any refund of (or credit in lieu of a refund of) Seller Taxes,
but only to the extent such refund was not taken into account as an asset in
the determination of the adjustment to the Cash Consideration under _ARTICLE
II_. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to take such steps as may be
reasonably available to secure any such refund or credit, including through
the filing of amended Tax Returns. Buyer shall inform Sellers Representative
shortly after the end of each calendar year as to whether any such refund or
credit is, or with the taking of action would be, available.

 



 

(b) As between Sellers and Buyer, Buyer shall be liable for and pay (or cause
to be paid) (i) all Taxes imposed on the Company or any Subsidiary for any
Post-Effective Time Tax Period and (ii) Excluded Taxes.

 



 

(c) Whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the
Company or any Subsidiary for the portion of a Straddle Period that ends on or
before the Effective Time, and the portion of a Straddle Period that begins
after the Effective Time, the determination shall be made by assuming that the
Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at
the close of June 30, 2016 and the other which began at the beginning of July
1, 2016, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Company
or such Subsidiary for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two
taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that
the books of the Company or such Subsidiary were closed at the close of June
30, 2016; _provided_ , _however_ , that exemptions, allowances or

       
 

 



 

deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as depreciation
deductions, shall be apportioned between such two taxable years or periods on
a daily basis.

 



 

(d) Severance Taxes shall be deemed attributable to the period during which
the production of the Hydrocarbons with respect to such Severance Taxes
occurred, and liability therefor shall be allocated to Sellers for any
Severance Taxes attributable to any Pre-Effective Time Tax Period, and to
Buyer for any Severance Taxes attributable to any Post-Effective Time Tax
Period.

 



 

(e) Property Taxes shall be deemed attributable to the period during which
ownership of the applicable Properties gives rise to liability for such
Property Taxes, and liability therefor allocated to Sellers for (i) all Tax
Periods ending prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the portion of any
Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time, and to Buyer
for (A) all Tax Periods beginning at or after the Effective Time and (B) the
portion of any Straddle Period beginning at the Effective Time. For purposes
of determining the allocations described in this _Section 6.1(e)_, Property
Taxes pertaining to a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the portion
of such Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time and the
portion of such Straddle Period beginning at the Effective Time by prorating
each such Property Tax based on the number of days in the applicable Straddle
Period that occur immediately before the date on which the Effective Time
occurs, on the one hand, and the number of days in such Straddle Period that
occur on or after the date on which the Effective Time occurs, on the other
hand.

 



 

(f) To the extent the actual amount of Production Tax is not determinable at
the time an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price is to be made with respect
to such Production Tax pursuant to _Section 2.2_ and/or _Section 9.1_, as
applicable, (i) the Parties shall utilize the most recent information
available in estimating the amount of such Production Tax for purposes of such
adjustment, and (ii) upon the later determination of the actual amount of such
Production Tax, timely payments will be made from one Party to the other to
the extent necessary to cause each Party to bear the amount of such Production
Tax that is allocable to such Party under this _Section 6.1_.

 



 

(g) Buyer shall be entitled to all rights to any refunds of Production Taxes
allocable to Buyer pursuant to this _Section 6.1 _regardless of when
received. Sellers shall be entitled to all rights to any refunds of Production
Taxes allocable to Sellers pursuant to this _Section 6.1_. If a Party or any
of its Affiliates receives a refund of Production Taxes to which the other
Party is entitled pursuant to this _Section 6.1_, such receiving Party shall
forward to the other Party the amount of such refund within thirty (30) days
after such refund is received, net of any reasonable costs or expenses
incurred by such receiving Party in procuring such refund. If any payment
pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ is subsequently reduced or disallowed, the
Party receiving such payment shall indemnify and hold harmless the Party
making such payment (and its Affiliates) from and against any Loss that is
attributable to such reduction or disallowance.

 



 

(h) All indemnities under this _Section 6.1_ and _ARTICLE X_ shall be
calculated on an after-tax basis taking into account all reductions in
federal, state, local and foreign Taxes (including estimated Taxes) realized
by the indemnified party as a result of the event giving rise to such
indemnity. All calculations shall be made at the time of the relevant
indemnification

      
 

 



 

payment using reasonable assumptions (as agreed to by the indemnifying Party
and indemnified Party) and present value concepts (using a discount rate equal
to the applicable federal rate in effect at the time of the indemnified event
using semi-annual compounding); _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not
be required to disclose to Sellers the Tax Returns of Buyer or its Affiliates
in support of any calculation of the after tax amount of any indemnity, but
upon Sellers Representatives request, such Tax Returns shall be provided to
an independent, nationally recognized, accounting firm that is acceptable to
both Parties that will review such Tax Return and inform the Parties whether
the calculation by Buyer is consistent with such Tax Returns, without
disclosing such Tax Returns to Sellers (the fees of the accounting firm shall
be shared equally between the Parties).

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Sellers and Buyer agree
that Sellers make no representation, warranty, and provide no other assurance
or indemnity, with respect to the amount of any Tax Attributes of the Company
or any Subsidiary, or with respect to the availability on and after the
Closing Date of any Tax Attribute of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) Sellers Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be filed all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are
due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) on or before the
Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all other Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company or any
Subsidiary (each such Tax Return, a " ** _Buyer Return_** "). All Buyer
Returns that relate to a Pre-Effective Time Tax Period shall be prepared and
filed in a manner consistent with past practice unless otherwise required by
applicable Law and, on such Tax Returns, no position shall be taken, election
made or method adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections
made or methods used in preparing and filing similar Tax Returns in prior
periods unless otherwise required by Law. With respect to any such Buyer
Return, not less than 60 days prior to the due date for such Buyer Return,
taking into account extensions (or, if such due date is within 60 days
following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing
Date), Buyer shall provide Sellers Representative with a draft copy of such
Tax Return and a statement (with which Buyer shall make available to Sellers
Representative supporting schedules and information), certifying the amount of
Tax shown on such Buyer Return that is allocable to Sellers pursuant to
_Section 6.1_ and any amount that Buyer reasonably believes Sellers could
have an indemnification obligation for pursuant to this _ARTICLE VI_ (which
statement shall also include a list of any positions taken, elections made or
methods used (if any) that are inconsistent with prior practice), for Sellers
Representatives review and comment. Such Buyer Return and statement shall be
final and binding on Sellers, unless, within 30 days after the date of receipt
by Sellers Representative of such Buyer Return and statement, Sellers
Representative delivers to Buyer a written request for explanation of any
items on or changes to such Buyer Return or statement. If Sellers
Representative delivers such request, then Sellers Representative and Buyer
shall undertake in good faith to resolve the issues raised in such request
prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for filing such Buyer
Return. Buyer shall make such changes and revisions to such Buyer Returns as

      
 

 



 

requested by Sellers Representative to the extent such changes and revisions
relate to Taxes allocable to the Pre-Effective Time Tax Period, provided that
such changes and revisions are consistent with applicable Law, but only to the
extent such changes and revisions relate to items that, if not changed as
requested by Sellers Representative, could result in an indemnification
obligation of Sellers pursuant to this _ARTICLE VI_. If Sellers
Representative and Buyer are unable to resolve any issue by the earlier of (i)
ten (10) days after the date of receipt by Buyer of the request for changes
and (ii) ten (10) days prior to the due date (including any extension thereof)
for filing of the Buyer Return in question, then Sellers Representative and
Buyer shall jointly engage a mutually agreed upon independent accounting firm
to determine the correct treatment of the item or items in dispute, which
accounting firm shall be required to decide only if the position of the
Sellers Representative or the position of Buyer shall be accepted. Each of
Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall bear and pay one
half of the fees and other costs charged by the independent accounting firm
with respect to the matters set forth in this _Section 6.2(b)_. The
determination of the independent accounting firm shall be final and binding on
both Sellers and Buyer.

 



 

(c) None of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer shall (or shall cause or permit
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to) make or change any Tax election,
amend, refile or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any statute of
limitation with respect to) any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable year or period
ending on or before the Closing Date or with respect to any Straddle Period
without the prior written consent of Sellers Representative (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), or take any other
action that would increase any Tax liability or reduce any Tax benefit in
respect of any taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date or
any Straddle Period (provided that Buyer shall be permitted to amend Straddle
Period Tax Returns if required by applicable Law, but only if Buyer provides
the Sellers Representative a draft of such amended Tax Return and the
statement described in _Section 6.2(b)_, and the procedures and covenants set
forth in _Section 6.2(b)_ shall apply with respect to resolving disputes and
filing such Tax Return).

 



 

Section 6.3 _Contest Provisions_. Buyer shall promptly notify Sellers
Representative in writing upon receipt by Buyer, or any of its Affiliates of
notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax
audits, proceedings, litigation, adjustments or assessments relating to any
Tax Period ending on or before the Effective Time or any Straddle Period or
relating to a Tax for which Sellers may be liable pursuant to this Agreement
(" ** _Tax Proceeding_** "). Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in
_ARTICLE X_, Sellers Representative shall have the sole right to represent
the Companys and each Subsidiarys interests in any Tax Proceeding relating
to a Tax Period ending on or before the Effective Time or any Straddle Period
if such Tax Proceeding is reasonably likely to adversely affect Sellers, and
to employ counsel of Sellers Representatives choice at Sellers expense;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer and its representatives shall be
permitted, at Buyers expense, to be present at, and participate in, any such
Tax Proceeding. Neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer shall be entitled to
settle, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any
claim for Taxes which could reasonably adversely affect Sellers relating to
any Tax Period ending on or before the Effective Time or to any Straddle
Period or relating to a Tax for which Sellers would be liable pursuant to this
Agreement without the prior written consent of Sellers Representative (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

      
 

 



 

Section 6.4 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding any requirement of Law, and
notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, all Transfer
Taxes required to be paid in connection with the sale or transfer of the
capital stock of the Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid 50% by
Sellers and 50% by Buyer. The Party responsible under Law for filing the
Transfer Tax returns shall timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed
and pay the applicable Transfer Taxes, with the other Party paying its share
of the Transfer Taxes to the Party filing the Tax Return no later than three
(3) Business Days prior to the due date for filing the applicable Tax Return
(taking into account all extensions). The Party filing the Tax Return shall
provide the other Party a copy of the receipt or other evidence of payment of
the Transfer Taxes that were paid. Each Partys preparation of any Tax Returns
for Transfer Taxes shall be subject to the other Partys (which, in the case
of Sellers, is the Sellers Representatives) prior approval, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Sellers and Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate with each other to share information reasonably
needed for the preparation and filing of Tax Returns and other documentation
relating to Transfer Taxes as may be required by applicable Law and to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Transfer Taxes required to be paid in
connection with the sale or transfer of the capital stock of the Company
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, each Seller and Buyer shall
(and shall cause their respective Affiliates to):

 



 

(a) assist the other Party in preparing or reviewing any Tax Returns which
such other Party is responsible for preparing and filing or entitled to review
in accordance with _Section 6.2_, and in connection therewith, provide the
other Party with any necessary powers of attorney;

 



 

(b) cooperate fully in preparing for, complying with, or defending against,
any Tax Proceeding regarding any Tax Returns or Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or with respect to the Properties;

 



 

(c) make available to the other and to any taxing authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or with respect to the Properties;

 



 

(d) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any
taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries or with respect to the Properties;
and

 



 

(e) timely provide any power of attorney or other similar form necessary for
the defense of any Tax Proceeding.

 



 

Section 6.6 _No Section 338 Election_. Sellers and Buyer agree that, without
the prior written consent of Sellers Representative, Buyer shall not make nor
cause or permit to be made any election under Section 338 or Section 336 of
the Code or under any applicable similar provision of state or foreign Law
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Purchase Price Adjustments_. Buyer and Sellers agree to report
any adjustment to the Purchase Price under _ARTICLES II and IX_ and any
indemnity payment under

      
 

 



 

 _ARTICLES VI and X_ as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal,
state, local and foreign income Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by a
final determination, as defined in section 1313 of the Code.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Withholding Tax_. Buyer shall be entitled to withhold from the
Cash Consideration paid to each Seller that is set forth on _Schedule_
_3.1(e)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule any U.S. federal tax required by
Law (it being understood that the withheld amount shall be determined based on
both the Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration), provided that at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer provides the Sellers
Representative a written schedule setting forth the estimated amount of such
withholding tax. The Parties shall negotiate in good faith any disagreements
as to the amount of the withholding tax. Buyer shall promptly pay to the
applicable Tax authority all amounts of Tax withheld from the Purchase Price
and shall provide the Sellers Representative with a formal receipt and IRS
Form 8288-A or other acceptable record of such payment. Any amount withheld
under this _Section 6.8_ shall be treated as though it was paid to the
applicable Seller, such Seller shall have no claim against the other Sellers
for such withheld amount, and such Seller shall not have any claim against
Buyer for the withheld amount provided it was promptly paid to the applicable
Tax authority. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with one another to reduce such amounts to the extent permitted by
Law, which cooperation may, at the request of the applicable Seller, include a
request from the United States Internal Revenue Service for a withholding
certificate under Treasury Regulations § 1.1445-3.

Section 10.4 _Procedures_.

 



 

(a) In order for a Person to be entitled to any indemnification provided for
under this _ARTICLE X_ in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim
made by any Person against the indemnified party (a " ** _Third-Party Claim_**
"), such indemnified party must notify the indemnifying party (which in the
case of Sellers, shall be Sellers Representative) in writing of the Third-
Party Claim promptly after receipt by such indemnified party of written notice
of the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that failure to give
such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder
except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually and
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 



 

(b) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the indemnifying party; _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that the indemnifying
party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim if
(i) the indemnified party shall have one or more legal or equitable defenses
available to it which are different from or in addition to those available to
the indemnifying party, and, in the reasonable opinion of the indemnified
party, counsel for the indemnifying party could not adequately represent the
interests of the indemnified party because such interests could be in conflict
with those of the indemnifying party, (ii) such Third-Party Claim involves
injunctive or other non-monetary relief ( _provided_ , _however_ , that if
such Third-Party Claim includes a request for injunctive or other non-monetary
relief, the indemnifying party may assume the defense of such Third-Party
Claim so long as the indemnified party has joint control of the defense of the
portion of such Third-Party Claim relating to the request for injunctive or
other non-monetary relief) or (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have
assumed the defense of such Third-Party Claim in a timely fashion (but in any
event within 30 days of written notice of such Third-Party Claim). If the
indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it
being understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense. The
indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel
employed by the indemnified party for any period during which the indemnifying
party has not assumed the defense thereof. If the indemnifying party chooses
to defend or prosecute a Third-Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall keep
the indemnified party reasonably apprised of the status of the Third-Party
Claim and shall furnish the indemnified party with copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the indemnifying party relating
to the Third-Party Claim, and the indemnified party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate (at the indemnifying partys sole cost and
expense) in the defense or prosecution thereof. If the indemnifying party
assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third-Party Claim without the indemnified partys prior written consent;
_provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that the indemnified party shall agree to any
settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third-Party Claim that the
indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the
indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Third-Party Claim, which releases the indemnified party completely and
unconditionally from all liability in connection

      
 

 



 

with such Third-Party Claim and that would not otherwise adversely affect the
indemnified party.

 



 

(c) In the event any indemnified party should have a claim against any
indemnifying party under this _ARTICLE X_ that does not involve a Third-Party
Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such indemnified
party, the indemnified party may make such claim directly against any
indemnifying party by delivering written notice of such claim to the
indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party does not notify the indemnified
party within 10 Business Days following its receipt of such notice that the
indemnifying party disputes its liability to the indemnified party under this
_ARTICLE X_, such claim specified by the indemnified party in such notice
shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the indemnifying party under this
_ARTICLE X_ and the indemnifying party shall pay the amount of such liability
to the indemnified party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the
amount of the claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date
when the amount of such claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally
determined.

 



 

(d) No Person shall be entitled to indemnification under _Section 10.1_ or
_Section 10.2_ unless it shall have given the Party from which indemnity is
sought written notice of the Liabilities for which it seeks indemnification
(which notice may be, in the case of Third-Party Claims, notice under _Section
10.4(a)_, and in the case of direct claims, notice under _Section 10.4(c)_)
within the applicable Survival Period.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. If the Closing occurs, except (a) as
expressly provided in this Agreement with respect to Title Defects and
Environmental Defects, (b) as set forth in the special warranty contained in
_Section 3.2(m)_, (c) as contained in any Environmental Indemnity Agreement,
(d) as contained in the Investment Agreement, or (e) in the case of actual,
intentional fraud, the indemnity obligations set forth in this Agreement shall
be the exclusive monetary remedies for the Parties for the breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement or any claim
arising out of, resulting from or related to the Transactions.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Extent of Indemnification_. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS
PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE
LIABILITIES IN QUESTION AROSE OUT OF OR RESULTED FROM, SOLELY OR IN PART, THE
SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE,
STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY SELLER
INDEMNIFIED PARTY OR BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTY, EXCEPTING ONLY LIABILITIES TO
THE EXTENT RESULTING FROM THE WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED
PARTY OR BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

 



 

Section 10.7 _Losses_.

 



 

(a) In the event a Party is obligated to make payments to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be,
pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_, any such amounts shall be net of any (i)
insurance proceeds realized by and paid to such indemnified party in respect
of or related to the event, cause or condition giving rise to such
indemnification obligation, and (ii) amounts actually recovered by such
indemnified party from third Persons

      
 

 



 

with respect to such event, cause or condition giving rise to such
indemnification obligation, in any case, after giving effect to any
expenditures to obtain such payments and any applicable deductible or
retention and resulting retrospective premium adjustment.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _ARTICLE X_, for
purposes of determining the amount of damages incurred or suffered with
respect to a breach of representation or warranty, and for purposes of
determining whether or not a breach of representation or warranty has
occurred, any reference to "material," "materiality," "Seller Material Adverse
Effect," "Company Material Adverse Effect" or "Buyer Material Adverse Effect"
in the applicable representation or warranty will be disregarded for purposes
of this _ARTICLE X_ only.

 



 

(c) IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY UNDER THIS _ARTICLE X _FOR
ANY (I) EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR (II) SPECULATIVE OR REMOTE DAMAGES,
UNLESS IN EACH CASE SUCH DAMAGES ARE REQUIRED TO BE PAID BY AN INDEMNIFIED
PARTY TO A THIRD PARTY THAT IS NOT AN AFFILIATE OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, a
claim for indemnity may be made by a Party under this _ARTICLE X_ in respect
of any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this
Agreement despite the fact that such Party had knowledge prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or prior to the Closing, as the case
may be, of the breach of such representation, warranty or covenant. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each of Buyer and Sellers are entitled to rely
upon, and shall be deemed to have relied upon, all representations, warranties
and covenants of any other Party set forth in this Agreement which are made in
favor of Buyer or Sellers, as applicable, and the rights of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties under this _ARTICLE X_
shall not be affected, notwithstanding (i) the making of this Agreement, (ii)
any investigation or examination conducted by or on behalf of a Party with
respect thereto, or (iii) the Closing hereunder.

 



 

(e) Buyer and Sellers agree to report each indemnification payment made in
respect of a Liability as an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price for federal
income Tax purposes.

 



 

(f) Each of the Parties acknowledges that indemnification obligations under
this Agreement and the Investment Agreement may overlap, and agree that any
claim for indemnification may be made under this Agreement or the Investment
Agreement; provided, however, that no Party may obtain duplicative
indemnification or other recovery under such agreements.

 



 

Section 10.8 _Claimants_. Any claim for indemnity under this _ARTICLE X_ by
any current or former Affiliate, stockholder, member, officer, director,
employee, agent, lender, advisor, Representative, accountant, attorney, or
consultant of any Party must be brought and administered by the applicable
Party to this Agreement. No indemnified party other than Sellers and Buyer
shall have any rights against either Sellers or Buyer under the terms of this
_ARTICLE X_ except as may be exercised on its behalf by Buyer or Sellers, as
applicable, pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_. Sellers and Buyer may elect to
exercise or not exercise indemnification rights under this _ARTICLE X_ on
behalf of the other Seller Indemnified Parties

      
 

 



 

and Buyer Indemnified Parties, respectively, affiliated with it in its sole
discretion and shall have no liability to any such other indemnified party for
any action or inaction under this _Section 10.8_.

 



 

Section 10.9 _Holdback_.

 



 

(a) Any amounts due to Buyer Indemnified Parties for any obligation or
liability for indemnification under _Section 10.2(a) or (b)(i)_ (except for
breaches of Seller Fundamental Representations or Company Fundamental
Representations) shall be satisfied solely from the Holdback Amount, provided
that all indemnifiable Liabilities under this _Article X_ or _Article VI_
will be satisfied first from the Holdback Amount, and the several nature of
Sellers representations and warranties and indemnification obligations shall
not affect Buyers right to collect the total amount of any Liabilities from
which indemnification is provided hereunder from the Holdback Amount;
_provided_ _,_ _however_ , that, subject to _Section 10.3_, Buyer may seek
payment for any other indemnifiable Liabilities directly from each Seller
severally, as to its Pro Rata Portion of the indemnified Liability if such
indemnified Liability arises pursuant to a breach of a representation or
warranty set forth in _Section 3.2_, or if such indemnified Liability arises
pursuant to a breach of a representation or warranty set forth in _Section
3.1_, the entire amount of such Liability.

 



 

(b) In the event Sellers Representative does not dispute any claim for
indemnification made by Buyer, at Buyers written election, Sellers
Representative and Buyer shall provide written instructions to the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement to disburse to Buyer the amount
of the undisputed claim. In the event Sellers Representative does dispute any

 **ARTICLE XI** ** 
ARBITRATION OF DISPUTED MATTERS**

 



 

Section 11.1 _Arbitration_.

 



 

(a) All Disputed Matters shall be determined by arbitration and governed by
this _ARTICLE XI_.

 



 

(b) With respect to any Disputed Title Matter, Buyer and Sellers
Representative shall select a mutually agreeable single arbitrator, who shall
be a title attorney with at least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas
titles involving properties in the regional area in which the Properties are
located, within fifteen (15) days following the Closing Date. With respect to
any Disputed Environmental Matter, Buyer and Sellers Representative shall
select a mutually agreeable single arbitrator, who shall be an environmental
consultant with at least ten (10) years experience, within fifteen (15) days
following the Closing Date. If Buyer and Sellers Representative have not
selected a mutually agreeable arbitrator in accordance with the provisions and
deadlines set forth in this _Section 11.1(b)_, then such arbitrator shall be
chosen in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules (" ** _Rules_** ")
of the American Arbitration Association (" ** _AAA_** ") (the arbitrator
selected in accordance with this _Section 11.1(b)_, the " ** _Arbitrator_**
").

 



 

(c) The Arbitrators determination shall be made within twenty (20) days after
submission of the Disputed Matters to the Arbitrator and shall be binding on
and non-appealable by the Parties.

 



 

(d) In making his determination with respect to any Disputed Matter, the
Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in _ARTICLE V_ and, subject
to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the
Arbitrator are necessary to make a proper determination; _provided_ _,_
_however_ _,_ that with respect to any Disputed Matter related to any Title
Defect Amount, Title Benefit Amount or Environmental Defect Amount, the
Arbitrator shall not award Buyer (or Sellers, if applicable) a greater amount
than the amount claimed by Buyer (or Sellers, if applicable) in its Title
Notice or Environmental Notice, as applicable.

 



 

(e) With respect to any Disputed Matter, the Arbitrator shall act as an expert
for the limited purpose of determining such specific Disputed Matter, and,
unless the Disputed Matter relates to a Title Defect Amount, a Title Benefit
Amount or an Environmental Defect Amount, may not award damages, interest or
penalties to either Party with respect to any Disputed Matter. Notwithstanding
the immediately preceding sentence, the Arbitrator may, however, award
reasonable costs, including attorney fees and fees and expenses associated
with the Arbitrator, to the Party determined by the Arbitrator to be the
prevailing Party in the arbitration of any Disputed Matter. Within ten (10)
days after the Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Sellers
Representative of such award, (A) Buyer shall pay to each Seller its Pro Rata
Portion of the amount, if any, so awarded by the Arbitrator to Sellers and (B)
each Seller,

      
 

 



 

severally and jointly, shall pay to Buyer its Pro Rata Portion of the amount,
if any, so awarded by the Arbitrator to Buyer.

 



 

Section 11.2 _Location_. Any arbitration hearing, legal proceeding or action
to enforce arbitration or otherwise shall be held in Houston, Texas, unless
another place is determined to be mutually acceptable to the Arbitrator and
the Parties.

accordance with the Rules to the extent such Rules do not conflict with the
terms of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.4 _Jurisdiction of Provisions_. The Arbitrator shall not have
jurisdiction or authority to add to, detract from or alter in any way the
provisions of this Agreement. Pending the final decision of the Arbitrator of
any Disputed Matter, all Parties will proceed diligently with performance of
all contractual obligations, including the payment of all sums not in dispute,
required by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties reserve
the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of
obtaining security or other provisional relief to satisfy or effectuate an
eventual arbitration award, including attachment and injunctive relief. The
commencement of any action for such relief in aid of arbitration shall not
constitute a waiver of the right to arbitration nor shall it prejudice in any
way the right to proceed to arbitration.

 



 

Section 11.5 _Written Decision or Award_. The written decision or award of the
Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the Parties and the Parties shall
abide by and comply with such decision and a judgment may be rendered upon
such decision or award in a court of competent jurisdiction. Unless
apportioned otherwise by the Arbitrator under _Section 11.1_ or _11.6_ ,
Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall equally bear the
cost of the services and expenses of the Arbitrator and all other costs of the
arbitration proceedings.

 



 

Section 11.6 _Authority of Arbitrator_. The Arbitrator shall be authorized to
consider only issues that this Agreement expressly requires to be submitted to
arbitration. The Arbitrator shall have the authority to determine whether the
Arbitrator is authorized by this Agreement to consider a matter submitted for
arbitration. If the Arbitrator concludes that he has no such authority, he
shall cease consideration of that matter and so notify both Parties. The
Arbitrator shall have the authority to equitably apportion the costs and
expenses of any arbitration between Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on
the other hand. **The Arbitrator shall have no authority to award incidental,
indirect, special, consequential (including lost profits or other
consequential or business interruption damages or any other damages not
measured by actual damages), multiple, statutory, punitive or exemplary
damages with respect to any Disputed Matters. This limitation of losses and
damages shall apply to any arbitration no matter when the proceeding is
initiated and shall survive the termination of this Agreement without limit**.

TERMINATION**

 



 

Section 12.1 _Termination_. This Agreement and the Transactions may only be
terminated on or before the Closing and only:

      
 

 



 

(a) by either Buyer or Sellers Representative if the Closing has not occurred
on or before December 31, 2016, or such later date as shall be mutually agreed
to in writing by Buyer and Sellers Representative (" ** _Outside Date_** ");

 



 

(b) by Sellers Representative, if any condition set forth in _Section
7.1(a), (b), (d) or (e)(ii)_ is not satisfied (or waived in writing by
Sellers Representative) as of the Scheduled Closing Date;

 



 

(c) by Buyer, if any condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a), (b), (c), (e) or
(f)(ii)_ is not satisfied (or waived in writing by Buyer) as of the Scheduled
Closing Date; or

 



 

(d) by the mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be entitled to terminate this
Agreement under _Section 12.1(a), (b) or (c)_ if such Party is, at such time,
in material breach of any covenants or agreements hereunder to be performed or
observed by such Party.

 



 

Section 12.2 _Effect of Termination_. Without limiting Sellers and Buyers
respective remedies and rights in regard to the Deposit under _Section 12.3_,
in the event of termination of this Agreement by Sellers Representative, on
the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, pursuant to _Section 12.1_,
written notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating Party to
the other Party, and this Agreement shall thereupon terminate; _provided_ ,
_however_ , _Section 3.5_, _Section 5.2(b)_, _Section 10.6_, this _ARTICLE
XII_ and _ARTICLE XIII_ will survive the termination of this Agreement and

Sellers Representative may terminate this Agreement and obtain and retain the
Deposit as its sole and exclusive remedy, including against the Financing
Sources, as liquidated damages. **It is expressly stipulated by the Parties
that the actual amount of damages resulting from any such termination would be
difficult, if not impossible, to determine accurately because of the unique
nature of this Agreement, the unique nature of the Properties, the
uncertainties of applicable commodity markets and differences of opinion with
respect to such matters, and that the liquidated damages provided for herein
are a reasonable estimate by the Parties of such damages**.

 



 

(b) _Buyer s Remedies_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, upon Sellers or the Companys breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement such that Buyer would be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.1(c)_, Buyer, at
its sole option, may either (i) enforce specific performance of this Agreement
or (ii) (A) terminate this Agreement, (B) receive back the entirety of the
Deposit, in which case Sellers Representative and Sellers will pay to Buyer
the

       
 

 



 

full Deposit within 10 Business Days following termination of this Agreement,
and (C) then, subject to _Section 13.8_, pursue whatever legal rights and
remedies may be available to Buyer (it being understood and agreed that,
subject to _Section 13.8_, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 12.1_ shall not limit or impair any legal rights or remedies that
Buyer may have with respect to a breach by Sellers of this Agreement).

 



 

(c) _Termination Without Breach_. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated under _Section 12.1_ under circumstances other than those
described in _Section 12.3(a) or (b)_, Buyer shall be entitled to receive
back the entirety of the Deposit, in which case Sellers Representative and
Sellers will pay to Buyer the full Deposit within 10 Business Days following
termination of this Agreement, and the Parties will have no obligation or
liability to one another hereunder other than as set forth in _Section 12.2_,
this _Section 12.3_ and the Confidentiality Agreements.

 



 

Section 12.4 _Confidentiality Agreements_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that that certain Confidentiality Agreement dated as of July 22, 2016, by and

Company, LLC covering Sellers confidential information (the " ** _Seller
Confidentiality Agreement_** ," together with the Buyer Confidentiality
Agreement, the " ** _Confidentiality Agreements_** ") shall remain in effect
following the Execution Date and any termination of this Agreement in
accordance with this _ARTICLE XII_; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that if the
Closing shall occur, then the Seller Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate
as of the Closing and be of no further force and effect thereafter; provided
further, however, that nothing contained in this _Section 12.4_ or in the
Seller Confidentiality Agreement shall prevent Buyer from sharing confidential

in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of the purchase of the Purchased Securities.

 



 

(b) __Information__. Such Investor has been furnished with and has had full
access to all materials relating to the business, finances and operations of
the Company and relating to the

 



      
 

 



 

offer and sale of the Purchased Securities that have been requested by such
Investor. Such Investor has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of
the Company and received answers thereto, as such Investor deemed necessary in
connection with the decision to purchase the Purchased Securities. Neither
such inquiries nor any other due diligence investigations conducted at any
time by such Investor shall modify, amend or affect such Investors right to
rely on the Companys representations and warranties contained in _Article
III_. Such Investor understands and acknowledges that its purchase of the
Purchased Securities involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty. Such
Investor has sought such accounting, legal and tax advice as it has considered
necessary to make an informed investment decision with respect to its
investment in the Purchased Securities, and has made its own assessment and
has satisfied itself concerning the relevant tax and other economic
considerations relevant to its investment in the Purchased Securities.

 



 

(c) __Cooperation__. Such Investor shall cooperate reasonably with the Company
to provide any information required to be included in the Companys securities
filings.

 



 

(d) __Investor Representation__. Such Investor is purchasing the Purchased
Securities for its own account, solely for the purpose of investment and not
with a view to distribution thereof. Such Investor has no present agreement,
undertaking, arrangement, obligation or commitment providing for the
disposition of the Purchased Securities. Such Investor understands and
acknowledges that the Purchased Securities it is purchasing are characterized
as "restricted securities" under the federal securities Laws inasmuch as they
are being acquired from the Company in a transaction not involving a public
offering. Such Investor has been advised and understands and acknowledges that
the Purchased Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or
under the "blue sky" Laws of any jurisdiction and may be resold only if
registered pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act (or if eligible,
pursuant to the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act or
pursuant to another available exemption from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act).

 



 

(e) __General Solicitation__. Such Investor is not purchasing the Purchased
Securities as a result of any advertisement, article, notice or other
communication regarding the Purchased Securities published in any newspaper,
magazine or similar media or broadcast over television or radio or presented
at any seminar or any other general solicitation or general advertisement.

 



 

(f) __Legends__. Such Investor understands and acknowledges that, until such
time as the Purchased Securities have been registered pursuant to the
provisions of the Securities Act, or the Purchased Securities are eligible for
resale pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act without any
restriction as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can
then be immediately sold, the Purchased Securities will bear the following
restrictive legend:

 



 

"THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
AS AMENDED. THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED FOR SALE, PLEDGED OR
HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF A REGISTRATION STATEMENT IN EFFECT WITH RESPECT
TO THE SECURITIES UNDER SUCH ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION
THEREUNDER AND, IN THE CASE OF A TRANSACTION EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION, UNLESS

 



      
 

 



 

SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 UNDER SUCH ACT OR THE ISSUER HAS RECEIVED
DOCUMENTATION REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO IT THAT SUCH TRANSACTION DOES NOT
REQUIRE REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT."

 



 

(g) __Reliance Upon Investor s Representations and Warranties__. Such
Investor understands and acknowledges that the Purchased Securities are being
offered and sold in reliance on a transactional exemption from the
registration requirements of federal and state securities Laws, and that the
Company is relying in part upon the truth and accuracy of the representations,
warranties, agreements, acknowledgments and understandings of such Investor
set forth in this Agreement in (i) concluding that the issuance and sale of
the Purchased Securities is a "private offering" and, as such, is exempt from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and (ii) determining the
applicability of such exemptions with respect to such Investors purchase of
the Purchased Securities.

 



 

Section 4.06 _Short Selling_. Such Investor represents and warrants that it
has not entered into any Short Sales of any Common Stock owned by it between
the time it first became aware of the identity of the Company as the
counterparty in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the date
hereof other than any Short Sales entered into by managed funds or accounts
over which such Investor has no discretion.

 



 

Section 4.07 _Exclusivity of Representations_. The representations and
warranties made by such Investor in the Transaction Documents are the
exclusive representations and warranties made by such Investor. Such Investor
hereby disclaims any other express or implied representations or warranties.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V** ** 
COVENANTS**

 



 

Section 5.01 _Taking of Necessary Action_. Each of the parties hereto shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts promptly to take or cause to be taken
all necessary action and promptly to do or cause to be done all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI** ** 
INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

Section 6.01 _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company agrees to indemnify
each Investor and its Representatives (collectively, " _Investor Related
Parties_ ") from all Losses, and hold each of them harmless against, any and
all Actions (including any inquiries), demands, and causes of action, as a
result of the breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of
the Company contained in this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that such claim
for indemnification relating to a breach of the representations or warranties
is made prior to the expiration of such representations or warranties to the
extent applicable, and in any event no later than twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date, except that (a) a claim for indemnification relating to a breach
of a Fundamental Representation may be made indefinitely and (b) a claim for
indemnification relating to a breach of the representations set forth in
_Section 3.16_ (Taxes)

 



      
 

 



 

may be made until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations; and
_provided further_ , that no Investor Related Party shall be entitled to
recover its own special, consequential or punitive damages under this _Section
6.01_.

 



 

Section 6.02 _Indemnification by Investors_. Each Investor agrees to indemnify
the Company and its Representatives (collectively, " _Company Related Parties_
") from all Losses, and hold each of them harmless against, any and all
Actions (including any inquiries), demands, and causes of action, as a result
of the breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of such
Investor contained in this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that such claim
for indemnification relating to a breach of the representations and warranties
is made prior to the expiration of such representations and warranties, and in
any event no later than 12 months after the Closing Date, except that a claim
for indemnification relating to a breach of a Fundamental Representation may
be made indefinitely; and _provided further_ , that no Company Related Party
shall be entitled to recover its own special, consequential or punitive
damages under this _Section 6.02_.

 



 

Section 6.03 _Additional Limitations on Indemnification_ _._ With respect to
indemnification by the Company or the Investors, (a) the Company and each
Investor shall not be liable, as applicable, under this _Article VI_ until
the aggregate amount of all claims against the Company or such Investor, as
applicable, in respect of indemnification under this _Article VI_, other than
with respect to indemnification for breach of any Fundamental Representation
or a breach of the representations set forth in _Section 3.16_ (Taxes),
exceeds $5,742,634.87 (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), in which event the Company
or such Investor, as applicable, shall only be liable for claims in excess of
the Threshold Amount, (b) the Company and each Investor shall not be liable,
as applicable, under this _Article VI_, except with respect to
indemnification for breach of any Fundamental Representation or a breach of
the representations set forth in _Section 3.16_ (Taxes), for any individual
or series of related costs, losses, liabilities, damages or expenses which do
not exceed $100,000 (which costs, losses, liabilities, damages or expenses
shall not be counted toward the Threshold Amount) and (c) the Companys and
the Investors maximum aggregate liability, as applicable, under this _Article
VI_, other than with respect to indemnification for breach of any Fundamental
Representation, shall be limited to $57,426,348.73; _provided, however_ , each
Investor will be entitled to its pro rata portion of any indemnification
provided by the Company under this _Article VI_, based on the percentage of
Purchased Securities purchased by such Investor and _provided further_ that in
no event will any Investor ever be liable for more than the amount of net
proceeds received by such Investor under the Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any damages
otherwise indemnifiable under this _Article VI_ shall be reduced by the
amount of insurance proceeds actually recovered by a Company Related Party or
Investor Related Party, as applicable, in respect of such damages (net of
costs of collection, deductibles and retro-premium adjustments). Damages shall
be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such damages constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Each of the parties
acknowledges that indemnification obligations under this Agreement and the
Acquisition Agreement may overlap, and agree that any such overlapping claim
for indemnification may be made under this Agreement or the Acquisition
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that any claim for indemnity made against an
indemnifying party which may be brought under _Article VIII_ shall be brought
under _Section 8.07_. No party may

 



      
 

 



 

obtain duplicative indemnification or other recovery under this Agreement and
the Acquisition Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.04 _Exclusivity of Remedy_. Except with respect to _Section 8.07_
and Article X of the Acquisition Agreement, indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article VI_ shall be the exclusive remedy of the parties
for any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty or covenant contained in
this Agreement or in any closing document executed and delivered pursuant to
the provisions hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of
_Section 8.07(c)_ shall apply, _mutatis mutandis_ , to indemnification claims
referred to in _Section 6.01_, _Section 6.02_, _Section 8.07(a)_ or
_Section 8.07(b)_.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII** ** 
STANDSTILL; LOCK-UP**

 



 

Section 7.01 _Standstill_. Each Investor agrees that, for a period of the
shorter of: (A) twelve (12) months from the Closing Date and (B) a date that
is at least six (6) months from the Closing Date when any Investor ceases to
Beneficially Own at least ten percent (10%) of the then outstanding shares of
Common Stock, neither it nor any of its controlled Affiliates will, without
the prior written consent of the Company: (i) acquire, offer to acquire, or
agree to acquire, directly or indirectly, by purchase or otherwise, any debt
or equity securities or direct or indirect rights to acquire any debt or
equity securities of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof, or any assets of
the Company or any Subsidiary or division thereof, (ii) make, or in any way
participate in, directly or indirectly, any "solicitation" of "proxies" (as
such terms are used in the rules of the SEC) to vote, or seek to advise or
influence any person or entity with respect to the voting of, any debt or
equity securities of the Company, (iii) make any public announcement with
respect to, or submit a proposal for, or offer of (with or without conditions)
any extraordinary transaction involving the Company or its debt, equity
securities or assets, (iv) form, join or in any way participate in a "group"
(as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) in connection with any of
the foregoing or (v) request the Company or any of its representatives,
directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this _Section
7.01_; _provided, however_ , that the restrictions set forth in clause (v)
shall terminate and be of no further force and effect if the Company enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to, or publicly announces that it
plans to enter into, a transaction involving all or a controlling portion of
the Companys equity securities or all or substantially all of the Companys
assets (whether by merger, consolidation, business combination, tender or
exchange offer, recapitalization, restructuring, sale, equity issuance or
otherwise). During the time period during which this provision is applicable
to an Investor, such Investor agrees to promptly advise the Company of any
inquiry or proposal made to such Investor or its Representatives with respect
to any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
paragraph shall be construed to prohibit investments made by Representatives
of an Investor in the ordinary course of business in connection with 401(k)
plans, mutual funds, pension plans, or similar arrangements, or customary cash
management policies, in each case only if not specifically targeted to an
investment in the Company or investments entered into by managed funds or
accounts over which such Investor has no discretion.

 



 

Section 7.02 _Lock-Up_. Each Investor agrees that, for a period of one hundred
and eighty (180) days from the Closing (the " _Lock-Up Period_ "), it will
not, without the prior written

 



      
 

 



 

consent of the Company: (i) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, grant any
option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, or
otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of the Purchased
Securities or any securities convertible into, exercisable for, or
exchangeable for shares of Purchased Securities or (ii) enter into any swap or
other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the
economic consequences of ownership of the Purchased Securities, whether any
such transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by
delivery of Purchased Securities or such other securities, in cash or
otherwise.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII** ** 
REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

 



 

Section 8.01 _Transfer Restricted Securities_. For purposes of this _Article
VIII_ and the registration rights granted to the Investors by the Company
hereunder, the Purchased Securities and any type of interest issued to a
Holder pursuant to _Section 8.10_ shall be " _Transfer Restricted Securities_
". Any Transfer Restricted Security will cease to be a Transfer Restricted
Security (i) when a registration statement covering such Transfer Restricted
Security becomes or has been declared effective by the SEC and such Transfer
Restricted Security has been sold or disposed of pursuant to such effective
registration statement; (ii) when such Transfer Restricted Security has been
disposed of pursuant to any section of Rule 144 (or any similar provision then
in effect) under the Securities Act; (iii) when such Transfer Restricted
Security is held by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries; (iv) when such
Transfer Restricted Security has been sold or disposed of in a private
transaction in which the transferors rights under this Agreement are not
assigned to the transferee of such securities pursuant to _Section 8.09_ or
(v) when such Transfer Restricted Security becomes eligible for resale without
restriction and without the need for current public information pursuant to
any section of Rule 144 (or any similar provision then in effect) under the
Securities Act, but only if the Holder of such Transfer Restricted Security is
not an Affiliate (as defined in Rule 144(a)(1)) of the Company.

 



 

Section 8.02 _Mandatory Registration_. Within thirty (30) days following the
Closing, (the " _Expected Filing Date_ ") the Company shall file a
registration statement with the SEC providing for registration and resale, on
a continuous or delayed basis pursuant to Rule 415, of all of the Transfer
Restricted Securities then outstanding (the " _Registration Statement_ "). The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act by
the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than thirty
(30) days following the filing of the Registration Statement, or one hundred
and twenty (120) days in the event the Registration Statement is reviewed by
the SEC (such effectiveness date, the " _Expected Effectiveness Date_ "). The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Registration
Statement continuously effective under the Securities Act until the earlier of
(A) the date when all the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by such
Registration Statement have been sold and (B) the date on which all of the
shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to this Agreement cease to be
Transfer Restricted Securities hereunder (such period, the " _Effectiveness
Period_ "). The Registration Statement when effective (including the documents
incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to form in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of any prospectus
contained in such Registration Statement, in the light of the circumstances
under

 



      
 

 



 

which a statement is made). As soon as practicable following the date that the
Registration Statement becomes effective, but in any event within two (2)
Business Days of such date, the Company shall provide the Holders with written
notice of the effectiveness of such Registration Statement.

 



 

Section 8.03 _Piggyback Registration_. (a) If the Company shall at any
time propose to register the offer and sale of any shares of Common Stock
under the Securities Act (excluding an offering relating solely to an employee
benefit plan, an offering relating to a transaction on Form S-4 or Form S-8),
the Company shall promptly notify any Holders with Transfer Restricted
Securities not already registered under a Registration Statement of such
proposal reasonably in advance of (and in any event at least five (5) Business
Days before) the filing of the relevant registration statement, as applicable
(the " _Piggyback Notice_ "). The Piggyback Notice shall offer such Holders
the opportunity to include in such registration the number of Transfer
Restricted Securities not already registered under a Registration Statement as
they may request (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "). The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to include in each such Piggyback Registration
such Transfer Restricted Securities for which the Company has received written
requests within three (3) Business Days after sending the Piggyback Notice ("
_Piggyback Request_ ") for inclusion therein. If a Holder decides not to
include all of its Transfer Restricted Securities in any Piggyback
Registration, such Holder shall nevertheless continue to have the right to
include any Transfer Restricted Securities not already registered under a
Registration Statement in any subsequent registration statement as may be
filed by the Company with respect to offerings of Common Stock, all upon the
terms and conditions set forth herein. The Holders right to Piggyback
Registrations shall not encompass a right to participate in an underwritten
offering initiated by the Company or by another Person; _provided_ , that if
the Company initiates an underwritten offering of Common Stock on behalf of
another Person, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
provide Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities an opportunity to
participate in such offering subject to customary underwriters cutback
provisions giving priority to the inclusion of the stock of such other Person
and other customary terms; and

 



 

(b) The Company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration
initiated by it under this _Section 8.03_ at any time in its sole discretion
whether or not any Holder has elected to include Transfer Restricted
Securities in such Piggyback Registration. The registration expenses of such
withdrawn registration shall be borne by the Company in accordance with
_Section 8.06_.

 



 

Section 8.04 _Blackout and Delay Rights_.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Companys
obligation to file and maintain the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement shall not apply in the following circumstances (collectively, "
_Blackout and Delay Events_ "):

 



 

(a) the Company shall not be required to file a Registration Statement (or any
amendment thereto) or, if a Registration Statement has been filed but not
declared effective by the SEC, request effectiveness of such Registration
Statement, for a period of up to forty-five (45) days, if (i) the Company
determines in good faith that a postponement is in the best interest of the
Company and its stockholders generally due to a pending transaction involving
the

 



       
 

 



 

Company (including a pending securities offering by the Company, or any
proposed financing, acquisition, merger, tender offer, business combination,
corporate reorganization, consolidation or other significant transaction
involving the Company), (ii) the Company determines such registration would
require disclosure of material information that the Company has a bona fide
business purpose for preserving as confidential, or (iii) audited financial
statements as of a date other than the fiscal year end of the Company would be
required to be prepared; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any
such period exceed an aggregate of ninety (90) days in any 365-day period; and

 



 

(b) the Company may, upon written notice to any Selling Holder whose Transfer
Restricted Securities are included in the Registration Statement or other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, suspend such Selling
Holders use of any prospectus which is a part of the Registration Statement
or other registration statement (in which event the Selling Holder shall
discontinue sales of the Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to the
Registration Statement or other registration statement contemplated by this
Agreement but may settle any previously made sales of Transfer Restricted
Securities) if (i) the Company determines that it would be required to make
disclosure of material information in the Registration Statement that the
Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential or
(ii) the Company has experienced some other material non-public event the
disclosure of which at such time, in the good faith judgment of the Company,
would adversely affect the Company; _provided, however_ , in no event shall
the Selling Holders be suspended from selling Transfer Restricted Securities
pursuant to the Registration Statement or other registration statement for a
period that exceeds an aggregate of forty-five (45) days in any 180-day period
or ninety (90) days in any 365-day period; provided further that the period
during which such Registration Statement must remain effective shall be
extended by a period equal to such suspension period. Upon disclosure of such
information or the termination of the condition described above, the Company
shall provide prompt notice to the Selling Holders whose Transfer Restricted
Securities are included in the Registration Statement, and shall promptly
terminate any suspension of sales it has put into effect and shall take such
other reasonable actions to permit registered sales of Transfer Restricted
Securities as contemplated in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.05 _Sale Procedures_ In connection with its obligations under this
_Article _ _VIII_ , the Company will, as expeditiously as possible (it being
understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the
Company shall not be required to provide any non-public information to any
Person hereunder unless such Person agrees to maintain the confidentiality of
such information):

 



 

(a) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to the
Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may
be necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective for the
Effectiveness Period and as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of
the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all Transfer Restricted
Securities covered by the Registration Statement;

 



 

(b) make available to one counsel selected by Holders of a majority of
Transfer Restricted Securities (the " _Holders  Representative_") (i) at
least three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated filing of the
Registration Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by
this Agreement or any supplement or amendment thereto (except for any filing

 



      
 

 



 

made under the Exchange Act that is incorporated by reference into the
Registration Statement), upon request, copies of reasonably complete drafts of
all such documents proposed to be filed (other than any filing made under the
Exchange Act that is incorporated by reference into the Registration
Statement), and use commercially reasonable efforts to address in each such
document when so filed with the SEC such comments as the Holder Representative
reasonably shall propose prior to the filing thereof, and (ii) such number of
copies of the Registration Statement or such other registration statement and
the prospectus included therein and any supplements and amendments thereto as
any Selling Holder may reasonably request in writing to the Company in order
to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the Transfer Restricted
Securities covered by such Registration Statement or other registration
statement;

 



 

(c) if applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or
qualify the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Registration
Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement
under the securities or blue sky Laws of such U.S. states as the Selling
Holders shall reasonably request in writing by the time the Registration
Statement is declared effective by the SEC; _provided, however_ , that no such
registration or qualification shall be required in any jurisdiction where, as
a result thereof, the Company would become subject to general service of
process or to taxation or qualification to do business in such jurisdiction
solely as a result of registration or qualification;

 



 

(d) promptly notify the Holders Representative, at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered by any of the Holders under the
Securities Act, of (i) the filing of the Registration Statement or any other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement or any prospectus or
prospectus supplement to be used in connection therewith, or any amendment or
supplement thereto (except for any filing made under the Exchange Act that is
incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement), and, with respect
to such Registration Statement or any other registration statement or any
post-effective amendment thereto, when the same has become effective; and (ii)
the receipt of any written comments from the SEC with respect to any filing
referred to in clause (i) and any written request by the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Registration Statement or any other registration statement
or any prospectus or prospectus supplement thereto, in each case that pertains
to the Selling Holders;

 



 

(e) immediately notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of (i)
the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus or prospectus
supplement contained in the Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement, as then in effect, includes an
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading (in the case of any prospectus contained therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which a statement is made); (ii) the issuance or
express threat of issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement, or the initiation of any proceedings
for that purpose; or (iii) the receipt by the Company of any notification with
respect to the suspension of the qualification of any Transfer Restricted
Securities for sale under the applicable securities or blue sky Laws of any
jurisdiction. Following the occurrence of any of the events set forth in
clauses (i) through (iii) above, the Company agrees to as promptly as
practicable, subject to any Blackout and Delay Event, amend

 



      
 

 



 

or supplement the prospectus or prospectus supplement or take other
appropriate action so that the prospectus or prospectus supplement does not
include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing and to take
such other commercially reasonable action as is necessary to remove a stop
order, suspension, threat thereof or proceedings related thereto;

 



 

(f) upon request, furnish to the Holders Representative copies of any and all
transmittal letters or other correspondence with the SEC or any other
Governmental Authority or self-regulatory body or other body having
jurisdiction (including any domestic or foreign securities exchange) relating
expressly to the Registration Statement that pertains to the Selling Holders;

 



 

(g) otherwise comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC;

 



 

(h) if requested by a Selling Holder, (i) incorporate in a prospectus
supplement such information as such Selling Holder reasonably requests to be
included therein relating to the sale and distribution of Transfer Restricted
Securities, including information with respect to the number of Transfer
Restricted Securities being offered or sold, the purchase price being paid
therefor and any other terms of the offering of the Transfer Restricted
Securities to be sold in such offering and (ii) make all required filings of
such prospectus supplement after being notified of the matters to be
incorporated in such prospectus supplement;

 



 

(i) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Transfer Restricted
Securities which are registered to be listed on the securities exchange on
which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed;

 



 

(j) if applicable, cooperate with each underwriter participating in the
disposition of Transfer Restricted Securities and their respective counsel in
connection with any filings required to be made with the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority;

 



 

(k) any of the Selling Holders may distribute the Transfer Restricted
Securities by means of an underwritten offering; _provided_ that (i) such
Selling Holders provide written notice to the Company of their intention
(collectively, in such capacity the " _Initiating Holder_ ") to distribute
Transfer Restricted Securities by means of an underwritten offering (the "
_Underwritten Offering Notice_ " and such Underwritten Offering being referred
to herein as an " _Underwritten Offering_ "), and Selling Holders having an
aggregate value of at least $50 million based on the closing trading price of
the Common Stock as of the date of such Underwritten Offering Notice ("
_Minimum Underwritten Offering Amount_ ") desire to include at least that
amount in such Underwritten Offering, (ii) the right of any Holder to include
such Holders Transfer Restricted Securities in an Underwritten Offering shall
be conditioned upon the reasonable cooperation of the Holder with the Company
in effecting such offering, (iii) the managing underwriter or managing
underwriters thereof shall be designated by the Selling Holders participating
in such Underwritten Offering ( _provided, however_ , that such designated
managing underwriter or managing underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable
to the Company), (iv) each Selling Holder participating in such Underwritten
Offering agrees to enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form and
sell such Selling Holders Transfer Restricted Securities on the basis

 



      
 

 



 

provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Initiating Holder,
(v) each Selling Holder participating in such Underwritten Offering completes
and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting
agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such
underwriting arrangements and (vi) the Company shall not be required to effect
an Underwritten Offering when doing so would be prohibited by the terms of a
customary "lock-up" or "market stand-off" provision included in an
underwriting agreement relating to a prior underwritten offering of the
Companys securities, or when the Company would not be required to file a
Registration Statement pursuant to _Section 8.04_. Upon receipt of an
Underwritten Offering Notice, the Company will provide prompt notice of such
Underwritten Offering to all Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities, and
each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities shall have the right to sell
Transfer Restricted Securities in such Underwritten Offering on a pro-rata
basis based on the number of Transfer Restricted Securities held by all such
Selling Holders (including the Initiating Holder) (or in such other proportion
as they shall otherwise agree). The Company hereby agrees with each Selling
Holder that, in connection with any Underwritten Offering in accordance with
the terms hereof, it will negotiate in good faith and execute (and as
applicable perform its obligations under) all customary indemnities,
underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the
terms of such underwriting arrangements, including using all commercially
reasonable efforts to procure customary legal opinions and auditor "comfort"
letters. The Company shall have no obligation to include in the Underwritten
Offering Transfer Restricted Securities of a Holder who has failed to timely
furnish such information which, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, is
reasonably required to be furnished or confirmed in order for the registration
statement to comply with the Securities Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(x) the Company is not obligated to effect more than, in combination with any
Underwritten Offerings (as defined in the 299 Investment Agreement) pursuant
to the 299 Investment Agreement, (A) two (2) Underwritten Offerings (as
defined in this Agreement and the 299 Investment Agreement) in any 12-month
period and (B) a total of six (6) Underwritten Offerings (as defined in this
Agreement and the 299 Investment Agreement) pursuant to this Agreement and the
299 Investment Agreement, and is not obligated to effect any Underwritten
Offering that is less than the Minimum Underwritten Offering Amount and (y) no
Holder that Beneficially Owns less than five percent (5%) of the then-
outstanding shares of Common Stock may initiate more than one Underwritten
Offering.

 



 

If, in the case of an Underwritten Offering, the managing underwriter advises
the Company that the inclusion of all of the Transfer Restricted Securities of
the Selling Holders in the subject Underwritten Offering would likely have an
adverse effect in any material respect on the price, timing or distribution of
Transfer Restricted Securities proposed to be included in such Underwritten
Offering, then the Company shall so advise all Selling Holders of Transfer
Restricted Securities that would otherwise be included in such Underwritten
Offering, and the number of Transfer Restricted Securities that may be
included in the Underwritten Offering shall be allocated to such Selling
Holders on a pro-rata basis based on the number of Transfer Restricted
Securities held by all such Selling Holders (including the Initiating Holder).
If such Underwritten Offering includes any other securities (" _Secondary
Securities_ ") in addition to Transfer Restricted Securities, then the number
of Secondary Securities and Transfer Restricted Securities proposed to be
included in such Underwritten Offering shall be included in the following
order: (i) first, Transfer Restricted Securities held by Selling Holders on a
pro-rata basis based on the number of Transfer Restricted Securities held by
all such Selling Holders

 



      
 

 



 

(including the Initiating Holder); and (ii) second, Secondary Securities. In
the event that the managing underwriter or managing underwriters limit the
number of Transfer Restricted Securities to be included in the Underwritten
Offering pursuant to this _Section 8.05(k)_ such that more than 50% of the
aggregate Transfer Restricted Securities set forth in the Underwritten
Offering Notice are excluded from the Underwritten Offering, such Underwritten
Offering shall not be considered to be an Underwritten Offering for purposes
of the limitations set forth in this _Section 8.05(k)_.

 



 

After receiving an Underwritten Offering Notice, for a reasonable period prior
to such Underwritten Offering, the Company will make available upon reasonable
notice at the Companys principal place of business or such other reasonable
place for inspection during normal business hours by the managing underwriter
or managing underwriters and their counsel, such financial and other
information and books and records of the Company, and cause the officers,
employees, counsel and independent certified public accountants of the Company
to respond to such inquiries and provide all information reasonably requested,
as shall be reasonably necessary (and in the case of counsel, not violate an
attorney-client privilege in such counsels reasonable belief) to conduct a
reasonable investigation within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities
Act.

 



 

In connection with any Underwritten Offering, the Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause appropriate officers and employees to
be available, on a customary basis and upon reasonable notice, to meet with
prospective investors in presentations, meetings and a road show (not to
exceed two (2) Business Days in length).

 



 

The Company will not name a Holder as an underwriter as defined in Section
2(a)(11) of the Securities Act in any Registration Statement without such
Holders consent. If the staff of the SEC requires the Company to name any
Holder as an underwriter as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act,
and such Holder does not consent thereto, then such Holders Transfer
Restricted Securities shall not be included on the Registration Statement and
the Company shall have no further obligations hereunder with respect to
Transfer Restricted Securities held by such Holder.

 



 

Each Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from the Company of the happening
of any event of the kind described in subsection _(e)_ of this _Section
8.05_, shall forthwith discontinue offers and sales of the Transfer Restricted
Securities by means of a prospectus or prospectus supplement until such
Selling Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
prospectus contemplated by subsection _(e)_ of this _Section 8.05_ or until
it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the prospectus may be
resumed and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings
incorporated by reference in the prospectus, and, if so directed by the
Company, such Selling Holder will deliver to the Company (at the Companys
expense) all copies in its possession or control, other than permanent file
copies then in such Selling Holders possession, of the prospectus covering
such Transfer Restricted Securities current at the time of receipt of such
notice.

 



 

Section 8.06 _Expenses_. Each party shall be responsible for its own fees and
expenses in connection with this _Article VIII_, except that the Company
shall pay: (i) all registration and filing fees (including fees and expenses
(A) with respect to filings required to be made with the

 



      
 

 



 

national stock exchange on which the Transfer Restricted Securities are
submitted for listing, (B) in compliance with applicable state securities or
"Blue Sky" Laws and (C) any fees of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, Inc.), (ii) printing expenses (including expenses of printing
certificates for Company securities and of printing prospectuses if the
printing of prospectuses is necessary), (iii) fees and disbursements of
counsel, auditors and accountants for the Company, (iv) Securities Act
liability insurance, if the Company so desires such insurance, and (v) fees
and expenses of all other Persons retained by the Company in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each
Selling Holder participating in an Underwritten Offering will bear its pro
rata share of the applicable underwriting discounts or similar fees based on
the number of such Selling Holders Transfer Restricted Securities to be
registered in such offering relative to the aggregate number of securities to
be registered in such offering.

 



 

Section 8.07 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) __Indemnification by the Company__. In the event of any registration of
any securities of the Company under the Securities Act pursuant to this
_Article VIII_, the Company will, and hereby does, indemnify and hold
harmless the seller of any Transfer Restricted Securities covered by such
registration statement, its Representatives, each other Person who
participates in the offering or sale of such securities and each other Person,
if any, who controls such seller or participant, within the meaning of the
Securities Act, against any Losses, joint or several, to which such seller,
participant or any such Representative or controlling Person may become
subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, as incurred, insofar as such
Losses (or Actions, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise
out of, are caused by, result from or are based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration
statement under which such securities were registered under the Securities
Act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus
contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and the
Company will reimburse such seller or participant and each such
Representative, and controlling Person for any legal or any other expenses
reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any
such Loss or Action; _provided, however_ , that the Company shall not be
liable in any such case to the extent that any such Loss (or Action in respect
thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such
registration statement, any such preliminary prospectus, final prospectus,
summary prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity
with information pertaining to the seller or participant furnished to the
Company by the seller of such securities in writing or electronically
specifically for use in the preparation thereof. Such indemnity shall remain
in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf
of such seller or participant or any such Representative or controlling Person
and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such seller.

 



 

(b) __Indemnification by the Sellers__. The Company may require, as a
condition to including any Transfer Restricted Securities in any registration
statement filed pursuant to _Section 8.02_, that the Company shall have
received an undertaking satisfactory to it from the prospective seller of such
securities, to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same
extent as set forth in _Section 8.07(a)_) the Company, each Representative of
the

 



      
 

 



 

Company and each other Person, if any, who controls the Company within the
meaning of the Securities Act, with respect to any statement or alleged
statement in or omission or alleged omission from such registration statement,
any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, if such statement or alleged
statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in
conformity with information pertaining to the seller or participant furnished
to the Company by the seller of such securities in writing or electronically
specifically for use in the preparation of such registration statement,
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or
supplement. The maximum liability of each seller for any such indemnification
shall not exceed the amount of net proceeds received by such seller from the
sale of its Transfer Restricted Securities. Such indemnity shall remain in
full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
the Company or any such Representative or controlling Person and shall survive
the transfer of such securities by such seller. All liability for any seller
under this _Section 8.07(b)_ shall be several and not joint with any other
seller.

 



 

(c) __Notices of Claims, etc__. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified
party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding involving a
claim referred to in _Section 8.07(a)_ or _Section 8.07(b)_, such
indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an
indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of
such action; _provided, however_ , that the failure of any indemnified party
to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of
its obligations under _Section 8.07(a)_ or _Section 8.07(b)_, except to the
extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to
give notice. In case any such action is brought against an indemnified party,
unless in such indemnified partys reasonable judgment a conflict of interest
between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such
claim, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and to
assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying
party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense
thereof, (i) the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified
party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in
connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation; and (ii) the indemnified party shall not, without the consent
of the indemnifying party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), consent
to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include
as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to
the indemnifying party of a release from all liability in respect to such
claim or litigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the
indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), consent
to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include
as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to
such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such
claim or litigation and contains no injunction or similar relief binding upon
the indemnified party. An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects
not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees
and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) for
all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim,
unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party there may be one or
more legal or equitable defenses available to such indemnified party that are
in addition to or may conflict with those available to another indemnified
party with respect to such claim. The provisions of this _Section 8.07(c)_
shall also apply to indemnification claims made pursuant to _Article VI_,
_mutatis mutandis_. For the

 



      
 

 



 

avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any assumption by an indemnifying party of
the defense of a claim hereunder, the indemnified party shall have the right
to employ separate counsel in any such matter and participate in the defense
thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
such indemnified party except as provided above.

 



 

(d) __Contribution__. If, other than for the reason set forth in the proviso
to the first sentence in _Section 8.07(c)_, the indemnification provided for
in this _Section 8.07_ is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any Losses referred to
herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified
party hereunder, shall contribute to the amounts paid or payable by such
indemnified party as a result of such Losses in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one
hand and of the indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the
statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations; _provided, however_ , that the maximum
amount of liability in respect of such contribution shall be limited, in the
case of each Selling Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities, to an amount
equal to the net proceeds actually received by such Selling Holder from the
sale of Transfer Restricted Securities effected pursuant to such registration.
The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party
shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by
the indemnified party and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Further, no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from
any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

 



 

Section 8.08 _Rule 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available the
benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC that may permit the sale
of the Transfer Restricted Securities to the public without registration, the
Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to:

 



 

(a) make and keep public information regarding the Company available, as those
terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, at all
times from and after the date hereof;

 



 

(b) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents
required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act at all
times from and after the date hereof; and

 



 

(c) so long as a Holder owns any Transfer Restricted Securities, furnish,
unless otherwise available via EDGAR, to such Holder forthwith upon request a
copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such
other reports and documents so filed as such Holder may reasonably request in
availing itself of any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing such Holder to
sell any such securities without registration.

 



 

Section 8.09 _Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights_. The rights to
cause the Company to register Transfer Restricted Securities granted to the
Investors by the Company

 



      
 

 



 

under this _Article _ _VIII_ may be transferred or assigned by any Investor
to one or more transferees or assignees of Transfer Restricted Securities;
_provided, however,_ that (a) unless the transferee or assignee is an
Affiliate of, and after such transfer or assignment continues to be an
Affiliate of, such Investor, the amount of Transfer Restricted Securities
transferred or assigned to such transferee or assignee shall represent at
least $25,000,000 of Transfer Restricted Securities (based on the market price
of the Common Stock on the trading day prior to such transfer), (b) the
Company is given prior written notice prior of any such transfer or
assignment, stating the name and address of each such transferee or assignee
and identifying the securities with respect to which such registration rights
are being transferred or assigned, and (c) each such transferee or assignee
assumes in writing responsibility for its portion of the obligations of such
Investor under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Recapitalization, Exchanges, Etc. Affecting the Shares_. The
provisions of this _Article VIII_ shall apply to the full extent set forth
herein with respect to any and all shares of the Company or any successor or
assign of the Company (whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or
otherwise) that may be issued in respect of, in exchange for or in
substitution of, the Transfer Restricted Securities, and shall be
appropriately adjusted for combinations, share splits, recapitalizations, pro
rata distributions of shares and the like occurring after the date of this
Agreement.

FULLEST EXTENT IT MAY EFFECTIVELY DO SO, THE DEFENSES OF LACK OF JURISDICTION,
IMPROPER VENUE OR AN INCONVENIENT FORUM TO THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH ACTION. THE
PARTIES FURTHER AGREE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THAT A FINAL AND
UNAPPEALABLE JUDGMENT AGAINST ANY OF THEM IN ANY ACTION CONTEMPLATED ABOVE
SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION BY SUIT ON

FACT AND AMOUNT OF SUCH JUDGMENT.

 



 

Section 9.12 _Specific Performance_. Each party acknowledges that if any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by it in accordance with
their specific terms, irreparable damage to the other party would occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and such other party shall be entitled to specific performance of
the terms hereof and immediate injunctive relief, without the necessity of
proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, in addition to any other
remedy available at law or in equity.
