 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of July 10, 2007, by and among GERDAU AMERISTEEL CORPORATION, a Canadian corporation (" _Parent_ "), GCV INC., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), solely for purposes of Section 1.15 and Article IIIA, GERDAU, S.A., a Brazilian corporation (the " _Guarantor_ "), and CHAPARRAL STEEL COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain terms have the meanings given to such terms in _Article VIII_.

 

 WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders for Parent to acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

 WHEREAS, in furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by Parent, it is proposed that Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company being the surviving corporation, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

 WHEREAS, the Company Board has (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, in accordance with the requirements of the DGCL, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement;

 

 WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent has (i) determined that the Merger is advisable and in the best interests of Parent and its stockholders and (ii) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger;

 

 WHEREAS, (i) the board of directors of Merger Sub has determined that the Merger is advisable and in the best interests of Merger Sub and its stockholders and (ii) the stockholders of Merger Sub, have adopted and approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger; 

 

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement, the Guarantor has provided the guaranty in favor of the Company, the terms of which are set forth in _Exhibit A_ attached hereto (the " _Guaranty_ "), with respect to the performance by Parent and Merger Sub of their obligations under this Agreement; and

 

 WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger, among other things, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, other than (i) shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or Merger Sub or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) shares of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and (iii) the Company Dissenting Shares, will be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as set forth herein.

 

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER

 

 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall continue its corporate existence under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall terminate.

 

 1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_.

 

 (a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place as soon as practicable, and in any event not later than two (2) Business Days after the satisfaction of each of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or at such other time as the parties hereto may agree (the date on which the Closing occurs, the " _Closing_ _Date_ "). The Closing shall take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, NY 10019, or at such other location as the parties hereto may agree in writing.

 

 (b) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the provisions of Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by Parent and the Company in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the effective time of the merger, the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 1.4 _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder of any of the following securities:

  (a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or Merger Sub or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) shares of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and (iii) Company Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $86.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time held by Parent or Merger Sub or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, or held in the treasury of the Company shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time.

 

 (b) All shares of Company Common Stock converted into Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 1.4_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent the right to receive with respect to each underlying share of Company Common Stock the Merger Consideration, without interest, plus any unpaid dividends.

 

 (c) Subject to the consent of Parent pursuant to _Section 4.2(b)_ , if, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration.

 

 1.5 _Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent or the Company, each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value, of Merger Sub shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation (which shares shall not be deemed to be shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for purposes of this Agreement).

 

 1.6 _Company Dissenting Shares_.

 

 (a) Notwithstanding _Section 1.4_ , shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has exercised such holders right to demand appraisal for such shares in accordance with the DGCL (" _Company Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. Holders of Company Dissenting Shares shall have those rights, but only those rights, of holders who perfect their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. If after the Effective Time any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 

 (b) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demand, purported demand, objection, notice, petition or other communication received from stockholders or provided to stockholders by the Company with respect to any Company Dissenting Shares or 

  shares claimed to be Company Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
shares. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any demand or purported demand respecting such Company Dissenting Shares.

 

 1.7 _Options and Other Awards_.

 

 (a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company Option_ "), whether or not then vested, shall vest, automatically be cancelled at the Effective Time and be converted into the right to receive, at the Effective Time, a lump sum cash payment in dollars equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price per share of such Company Option (such amount, " _Option Consideration_ "), less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Company Options the cash payments described in this _Section 1.7(a)_ on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event within five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date.

 

 (b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of restricted Company Common Stock (" _Company Restricted Shares_ ") shall vest in full and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 1.4(a)_ , less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment.

 

 (c) Immediately following the Effective Time, each deferred stock award or common stock equivalent award measured by the value of a number of shares of Company Common Stock (together, " _Deferred Shares_ ") shall be converted into a vested obligation to pay cash with a value equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of Deferred Shares (such amount, the " _Deferred Share Consideration_ "), payable on a deferred basis at the time that the underlying Deferred Shares would have been settled under their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, plus earnings thereon (as described below), less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. From and after the Effective Time until the applicable payment date, the Deferred Share Consideration shall earn interest at a rate equal to 120% of the long-term Applicable Federal Rate as prescribed under Section 1274(d) of the Code.

 

 (d) The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Compensation Committee_ ") and/or the Company Board, as applicable, shall make such adjustments and amendments to or make such determinations with respect to Company Options, Company Restricted Shares and Deferred Shares to implement the foregoing provisions of this _Section 1.7_.

 

 1.8 _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended in its entirety to read in the form of the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, 

  except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "GCV Inc.," and, as
amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

 1.9 _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 1.10 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, subject to applicable Laws, (i) the existing members of the board of directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal, and (ii) the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 

 1.11 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause their respective officers to take all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

 

 1.12 _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent for the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and (ii) deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent an amount in cash equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Company Common Stock shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 1.4_ (such cash, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be the property of and payable to Parent.

 

 1.13 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

 (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of one or more certificates of Company Common Stock whose shares are being converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.4_ a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form, and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates of Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon delivery of the certificates of Company Common Stock to the Paying Agent or delivery of a lost stock affidavit and indemnity (the " _Lost Stock Affidavit_ ") in form as approved by Parent, in its 

  sole discretion) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
certificates of Company Common Stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Upon proper surrender of a certificate of Company Common Stock for exchange
and cancellation or delivery of a Lost Stock Affidavit, as appropriate, to the
Paying Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such certificate of Company Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of Merger Consideration
provided in _Section 1.4_ , and the certificate of Company Common Stock so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued
on any cash or on any unpaid dividends or distributions payable to holders of
certificates of Company Common Stock.

 

 (b) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any certificates of Company Common Stock representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Paying Agent, each such share shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided in _Section 1.4_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of any share of Company Common Stock prior to the Effective Time that has not been registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such share of Company Common Stock shall be paid to the transferee of such share if the certificate that previously represented such share is presented to the Paying Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid.

 

 (c) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be paid to Parent. Any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this _Article I_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock formerly held by such stockholder as determined pursuant to this Agreement without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company, Parent, the Paying Agent nor any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 

 (d) In the event any certificate of Company Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of a Lost Stock Affidavit by the Person claiming such certificate of Company Common Stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate of Company Common Stock, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate of Company Common Stock the Merger Consideration such holder has a right to receive pursuant to this _Article I_.

 

 1.14 _Withholding_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration deliverable under this Agreement, and from any other payments made pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to such delivery and payment under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all 

  purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the holder of
shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent.

 

 1.15 _Guaranty of Guarantor_. Pursuant to the form of Guaranty as set forth on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto, Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the due and punctual performance by Parent and Merger Sub of each and every obligation of Parent and Merger Sub arising under this Agreement, including, without limitation, payment by Merger Sub of the Merger Consideration, the Option Consideration and the Deferred Share Consideration, pursuant to the Merger.

 

ARTICLE II 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

 Except as disclosed in the disclosure letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement and delivered to Parent in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), which disclosure shall be subject to _Section 9.4_ , the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

 2.1 _Corporate Organization, Standing and Power_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries which is a corporation is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries which is a limited liability company, limited partnership, business trust or other form of legal entity is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization.

The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and will supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger.

The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, and to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings (including any notification required by the HSR Act), to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, 

   consents, approvals, authorizations of all Third Parties and Governmental
Entities, and the expiry or termination of all applicable waiting periods,
which are required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that they will
consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations (including as required under the Exon-
Florio Amendment, as applicable) of all Third Parties and Governmental
Entities, and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act or under any other Antitrust Law, necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party
will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion
of the transactions contemplated herein. Each of Parent and the Company shall,
and each shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, use its best efforts to
resolve any objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with
respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Subject to  _Section 4.3_ , each of Parent and the Company
shall not, and each of Parent and Company shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries not to, engage in any action or transaction that would materially
delay or materially impair the ability of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent and the Company further covenant and agree, with respect to
any threatened or pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order,
decree or ruling or statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would
materially adversely affect the ability of the parties hereto to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to use their respective best
efforts to prevent the entry, enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case
may be, including by defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

  (c) Each of Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 5.1(b)_ to
obtain all requisite permits, consents, approvals, authorizations (including
as required under the Exon-Florio Amendment, as applicable) of all Third
Parties and Governmental Entities, and expirations or terminations of
applicable waiting periods for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law (i) cooperate in all respects
with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by
a private party; (ii) keep the other party and/or its counsel informed of any
communication received by such party from, or made by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental Entity and of
any communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (iii) permit the other party and/or its counsel to review
in advance any submission or communication intended to be given by it to, and
consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC,
the DOJ or any such other Governmental Entity or, in connection with
any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the extent
not prohibited by the FTC, the DOJ or such other Governmental Entity or other
Person, take all reasonable steps necessary to provide the other party and/or
its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences. Without limitation of the foregoing, Parent and the Company shall
not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or any other antitrust or
merger control Laws nor enter into any agreement with the Federal Trade
Commission or the Antitrust Division of the United States not to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except with the prior written
consent of the other party hereto.

   In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the parties hereto shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Parent and the Company may, as each
deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section 5.1(c)_ as "
_Antitrust Counsel Only Material_." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express written permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company
as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section_ _5.1(c)_ , materials provided to the other party or
its outside counsel may be redacted to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Company Common Stock or the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Antitrust Law_ " means the
Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act,
and all Laws, Governmental Orders and judicial doctrines that are designed
or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition.

 

  (d) Parent further agrees to use its best efforts to take or cause to
be taken, all actions and use its best efforts to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary or advisable to promptly cause expiration or termination of
all applicable waiting periods or to obtain requisite consents, permits,
approvals and authorizations for consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (and resolve any objections or suits) by any Governmental
Entity under any Antitrust Law, which actions and things shall include to the
extent necessary, Parent's agreement to (i) sell, hold separate or otherwise
dispose of, agree to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or permit
the sale, holding separate or other disposition of, the Assets or business to
be acquired in this transaction or any of Parent's or its Affiliate's other
assets or businesses now owned or hereafter acquired by Parent in a manner
which would resolve such objections or suits; (ii) terminate any existing
relationships and contractual rights and obligations; and (iii) amend or
terminate such existing licenses or other Intellectual Property agreements
and/or enter into such new licenses or other Intellectual Property agreements
(and in each case, enter into agreements with the relevant Governmental Entity
giving effect thereto); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent may expressly
condition any such sale, holding separate or other disposal, and any agreement
to take any such action or to conduct its business in any manner, upon
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
and nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company to agree to any such
sale, holding separate or other disposal, and any agreement to take any action
or conduct its business in any manner, prior to consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the obligations set
forth under this _Section 5.1(d)_ , in the event that any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding is instituted by a Governmental Entity or
private party challenging any transaction or agreement contemplated by
this Agreement, under any Antitrust Law (A) each of Parent and the Company
shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective best
efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Governmental Order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement so as to permit such consummation by the second (2nd) Business Day
before the Outside Date and (B) each of Parent and the Company shall defend,
at its own cost and expense, any action or actions, whether judicial or
administrative, against it or its Affiliates in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

    (e) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 5.1(c)_ with respect to
Antitrust Counsel Only Material, Parent and the Company shall, upon request,
furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their
respective Subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing, notice, application
or other document made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

  (f) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

  (g) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Date neither
Parent nor the Company will enter into or consummate any acquisition or
license agreement which would present a material risk of making it materially
more difficult to obtain any approval or authorization required in connection
with the transactions contemplated herein with respect to the HSR Act or any
other applicable Antitrust Law.

 

  (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (other
than the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.1 and of Section 7.3(f)), in
connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, no party or its Affiliates shall be required to pay or commit to
pay to such Person any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or to
incur any liability or other obligation ( _provided_ , _however_ , that such
party shall give the other party hereto the opportunity to make such
payments).

 

  5.2 _Access to Information_. Subject to applicable Laws, the Company
(i) agrees to provide Parent and Parent's officers, directors, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors, agents and other representatives
(collectively, the " _Parent Representatives_ "), from time to time from the
date hereof until the Effective Time, reasonable access during normal
business hours to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices, plants
and other facilities, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and such other information as Parent shall reasonably request with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses, financial
conditions and operations and (ii) instruct its employees, counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives to cooperate
with Parent in its investigation, including furnishing Parent with all
financial data and information that Parent, through its officers, employees,
consultants or agents, may reasonably request in order to comply with
obligations under applicable securities law regarding the preparation and
filing of financial statements in connection with completed or probable
significant acquisitions and cooperating with Parent (and using reasonable
best efforts to cause the Company's auditors to cooperate with Parent) in the
preparation of such financial statements. Except as required by applicable
Laws (including applicable securities law regarding the preparation and filing
of financial statements and the provision of other information in connection
with completed or probable significant acquisitions), Parent shall hold, and
shall cause Parent's Affiliates and the Parent Representatives to hold, any
non-public information received from the Company, directly or indirectly,
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

  5.3 _Cooperation with Parent Public Offering_. The Company hereby consents to the use of its Confidential Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) by Parent for the purposes of and in connection with a proposed public offering by Parent and to the disclosure of such Confidential Information to the investment bankers, attorneys and other advisors engaged in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Confidential Information shall only be disclosed to the public upon the Company first being given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the content of the disclosure relating to the Company; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure which may be made prior to the Effective Time shall be made only as required under United States securities laws; _provided_ , _further_ , that such disclosure shall not adversely affect the Company in any material respect. The Company shall, and shall and use best efforts to cause the Companys auditors to, cooperate with Parent in connection with Parents proposed public offering.

The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Laws.

Unless otherwise permitted by this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release, scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors or analysts or otherwise making any public statement regarding the terms of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and neither shall issue any such press release or make any such statement without the prior approval of the other (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Laws or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or make such public statement or disclosure shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing such press release or making such public statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that any public statement or disclosure that is consistent with a public statement or disclosure previously approved by the other party shall not require the prior approval of such other party.

 

 5.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances_.

Company to consummate this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

 5.7 _Employees; Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

 (a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current and former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Employee_ " and together, the " _Company Employees_ ") compensation and benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, to such Company Employee than the compensation and benefits provided to such Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (A) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide Company Employees whose employment terminates during the one-year period following the Effective Time with the same severance benefits as are currently provided under the Companys existing severance plan or policy and (B) during such one-year period following the Effective Time, severance benefits offered to Company Employees shall be determined without taking into account any reduction after the Effective Time in compensation paid to Company Employees.

 

 (b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to (x) benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan, (y) benefit accrual or eligibility under any post retirement health or welfare plan or (z) to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee (other than the health care flexible spending accounts benefits, which are addressed in clause (iii) below), Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in 

   the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan and (iii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing health care flexible spending account benefits or dependent care
flexible spending account benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall take
into account the contributions of such Company Employee and reimbursements
received by such Company Employee under the Old Plan for the plan year in
which the employee's participation in the New Plan commences for purposes of
determining the reimbursements that may be made to such employee under the New
Plan for the plan year in which such employee's participation in the New
Plan commences; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Old Plan and New Plan do
not operate on the same plan year, the Company Employee's participation in
each Old Plan providing health care flexible spending account benefits or
dependent care flexible spending account benefits shall continue for the
remainder of the current plan year and such Company Employees will be eligible
to participate in each New Plan providing health care flexible spending
account benefits or dependent care flexible spending account benefits after
the close of the current plan year.

 

  (c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pay to
each Company Employee employed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time

annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and

Incentive Plan (Fiscal Year 2008) (together, the " _2008 Incentive Programs_
") a payment equal to the product of (x) the greater of (A) the Company
Employee's award under the comparable agreement or plan for fiscal year 2007
and (B) the Company Employee's entitlement under the applicable 2008
Incentive Program determined in good faith by the Company based on the
Company's actual performance through the end of the last full month
immediately preceding the Effective Time, extrapolated on a straight line
basis, in order to establish a full year performance measure and a full year
incentive award and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall equal the
number of days commencing with and including June 1, 2007 through and
including the Effective Time and the denominator of which is 365.

 

  (e) The Company shall continue to pay monthly and quarterly cash
bonuses to Company Employees participating in the Company's Fiscal Year 2008

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in their capacities as such (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any claim based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or taken at the request of Parent pursuant to _Section 5.6_ or otherwise under this Agreement.

  insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an
annual premium in excess of the Insurance Amount, Parent or the Company, as
applicable, will obtain the maximum amount of directors and officers
insurance or "tail" coverage obtainable for an annual premium equal to the

When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, a Section, an Exhibit or a Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The phrase "the date of this Agreement" and terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in the first paragraph of this Agreement. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, (i) the words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation," (ii) the word "or" shall not be exclusive, (iii) the words "hereof," "herein" and "hereby" and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole (including any Exhibits and Schedules hereto) and not to any particular provisions of this Agreement, (iv) all references to any period of days shall be to the relevant number of calendar days unless otherwise specified, (v) all references to dollars or to "$" shall be references to United States dollars and (vi) all accounting terms shall have their respective meanings under GAAP.

 

 9.4 _Disclosure Schedules_. Disclosure of any matter in any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other Section of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is applicable to such other Section. The mere inclusion of an item in such Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.

 

 9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. Facsimile or PDF transmission of any signature will be deemed the same as delivery of an original.

 

 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including the Exhibits, the Schedules, including the Company Disclosure Schedule and Parent Disclosure Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the Closing, in accordance with its terms.

 

 9.7 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ that Parent or Merger Sub may assign all or part of their respective rights or obligations, without reducing their own obligations hereunder, to an Affiliate of Parent. Subject to the preceding sentence, this 

   Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

  9.8 _Amendments and Waivers_. (a) Any provision of this Agreement may
be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party
against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_ that an amendment made
subsequent to adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company
shall not (i) alter or change the amount or kind of consideration to be
received on conversion of Company Common Stock or (ii) alter or change any of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement if such alteration or change would
adversely affect the holders of Company Common Stock in any material respect.

 

  (b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
hereunder provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by applicable Laws.

 

  9.9 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for (a) the rights of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration
after the Effective Time, (b) the rights of holders of Company Options,
Company Restricted Shares and Deferred Shares pursuant to _Section 1.7_
(Options and Other Awards), (c) the right of the Company on behalf of its
stockholders to pursue damages in the event of Parent's or Merger Sub's
breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, and (d) the
provisions of _Section 5.8 _ (Director and Officer Indemnification), this
Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than
the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

 

  9.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without
reference to such state's principles of conflicts of law. Each of the parties
hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable,
any Delaware State court and the Federal court of the United States of America
sitting in the State of Delaware) in connection with any matter based upon or
arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that
process may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the Laws of the
State of Delaware for such Persons and waives and covenants not to assert or
plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction and
such process.

 

  9.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not to be performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof in addition to
any other remedies at law or in equity.

 

  9.12 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto have participated
jointly and been represented by counsel in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement and, therefore, this Agreement shall be construed without
regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction

   or interpretation in favor of or against any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

 

  9.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY
AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT WHICH ANY PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING, LITIGATION OR COUNTERCLAIM BASED ON, OR ARISING OUT
OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT,
COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY
PARTY. IF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY LAWSUIT IS ONE IN WHICH THE WAIVER OF JURY
TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL PRESENT AS A NON-
COMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY SUCH LAWSUIT ANY CLAIM BASED ON, OR ARISING OUT
OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL
CANNOT BE WAIVED.

 

  9.14 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void, invalid or unenforceable, the
remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall be
interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties further agree to replace such illegal, void, invalid or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a legal, valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such illegal, void, invalid or unenforceable provision.

  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub, Guarantor and the Company have caused this Agreement to be executed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the date first above written.
