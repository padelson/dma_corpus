the Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company, respectively, and their respective
stockholders that the Company be acquired by the Buyer;

 

WHEREAS, the acquisition of the Company shall be effected through a merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer;

 

WHEREAS, following the approval of this Agreement by the Board of Directors of
the Company, (a) the Company has delivered the Consent Solicitation to holders
of all of the outstanding Company Shares and (b) as an inducement to the
willingness of the Buyer and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, holders
of [**] of the outstanding Company Shares (the "Required Stockholders") have
signed the written consent, joinder, release and waiver attached hereto as
Exhibit A, which, in accordance with Section 228(c) of the DGCL, shall be
effective as of immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement
(the "Written Consent"); and

 

WHEREAS, as an inducement to the willingness of the Buyer and Merger Sub to
enter into this Agreement, each Person named on Schedule 1 has executed a non-
competition agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B;

 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by
each of the Parties, and intending to be legally bound, the Parties hereby
agree as follows:  

ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER

 

1.1The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company at the Effective
Time. From and after the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the Surviving
Corporation. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of
the DGCL.

 

1.2The Closing. The Closing shall take place at the offices of Wilmer Cutler
Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109,
commencing at 10:00 a.m. local time on the Closing Date.

 

1.3Certain Actions. 

 

(a)At least four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to the Buyer a certificate, in form and substance satisfactory
to the Buyer (the "Pre-Closing Certificate"), duly executed by the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company and setting
forth:

 

(i)the Company's good faith and reasonable estimates and calculations of the
following: (A) Closing Cash ("Estimated Closing Cash"); (B) the Company
Expense Amount (the "Estimated Company Expense Amount"); (C) the Company Debt
Amount (the "Estimated Company Debt Amount"); (D) the Employee Obligations
Amount (the "Estimated Employee Obligations Amount"); and (E) Closing Net
Working Capital ("Estimated Net Working Capital"); and

 

(ii)a complete and accurate listing of each item of Company Expenses, Company
Debt and Employee Obligations included in the calculations of the Estimated
Company Expense Amount, the Estimated Company Debt Amount and the Estimated
Employee Obligations Amount, respectively.

 

The Pre-Closing Certificate shall be accompanied by (A) reasonable detailed
supporting documentation (including an estimated balance sheet of the Company
as of the Closing prepared in accordance with GAAP and in the form and format
of Exhibit C); (B) an updated Allocation Schedule; (C) wire transfer
instructions for the payment and satisfaction of all Company Expenses and
copies of invoices submitted by each payee of Company Expenses confirming that
all amounts payable to them for services rendered through the Closing in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the
Agreement will be paid in full (and all of the Company's liabilities in
respect thereof will be fully discharged) upon each such payee's receipt of
the amount included within the Company Expense Amount; (D) payoff letters in
form and substance satisfactory to the Buyer for the payment and satisfaction
of all Company Debt, including wire transfer instructions for the payment
thereof and a complete release of the Company (and all of its rights,
properties and assets) from all Security Interests (other than Permitted
Interests) and liabilities with respect to such Company Debt, duly executed by
each Person to whom such Company Debt is owed, effective upon the discharge of
such Company Debt at the Closing; (E) instructions for the payment and
satisfaction of all Employee Obligations; and (F) wire transfer

   

instructions for the delivery of the Company Equityholder Representative
Expense Amount. If prior to the Closing, the Buyer objects in good faith to
the Company's determination of Estimated Closing Cash, the Estimated Company
Expense Amount, the Estimated Company Debt Amount, the Estimated Employee
Obligations Amount and/or Estimated Net Working Capital, then, for purposes of
calculating the Closing Merger Consideration, each such item disputed by the
Buyer shall be as reasonably determined by the Buyer.

 

(b)At the Closing:

 

(i)the Company shall deliver to the Buyer and Merger Sub the various
certificates, instruments and documents referred to in Section 6.1 (other than
the items described in Sections 6.1(a)(i) and 6.1(i), which shall be delivered
to the Buyer and Merger Sub prior to the Closing in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement);

 

(ii)the Buyer and Merger Sub shall deliver to the Company the items referred
to in Sections 6.2(d) and 6.2(e);

 

(iii)the Buyer shall cause the Certificate of Merger to be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; and

 

(iv)the Buyer shall:

 

(A)pay or cause to be paid (in accordance with the applicable wire transfer
instructions accompanying the Pre-Closing Certificate) the Company Expenses
identified in the Pre-Closing Certificate to the Persons to whom such Company
Expenses are owed (as set forth in the Pre-Closing Certificate);

 

(B)pay or cause to be paid (in accordance with the applicable wire transfer
instructions accompanying the Pre-Closing Certificate) the Company Debt
identified in the Pre-Closing Certificate to the Persons to whom such Company
Debt is owed (as set forth in the Pre-Closing Certificate);

 

(C)deposit or cause to be deposited the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent to
be held in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the
Escrow Agreement;

 

(D)deliver or cause to be delivered the Company Equityholder Representative
Expense Amount to the Company Equityholder Representative in accordance with
the applicable wire transfer instructions accompanying the Pre-Closing
Certificate; and

 

(E)pay or cause to be paid (by wire transfer) to the Payment Agent an amount
in cash equal to the portion of the Closing Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to clause (i) of Section 1.5(a).

 

1.4Additional Actions. The Surviving Corporation may, at any time after the
Effective Time, take any action, including executing and delivering any
document, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub,
necessary in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

   

1.5Conversion of Company Shares; Conversion of Merger Sub Shares. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any Party or the holder of any Company Share:

 

(a)Conversion of Company Shares. Each Company Share that is issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
Dissenting Share or any Company Share referenced in Section 1.5(b)) shall be
canceled and converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive,
without interest and subject to Section 1.14, (i) the Per Share Closing Stock
Consideration Amount, (ii) if any Future Payment becomes payable pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, such Company Share's Equityholder Pro Rata Share
of such Future Payment, and (iii) if any Stockholder Adjustment Payment
becomes payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, such Company Share's Stockholder Pro Rata Share of such Stockholder
Adjustment Payment, in each case as set forth on the Allocation Schedule.

 

(b)Cancellation of Treasury Stock. Any Company Shares held in the Company's
treasury immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired
without payment of any consideration therefor.

 

(c)Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, $0.0001 par value
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and thereafter evidence one share of
common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.6Dissenting Shares.

 

(a)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 1.5(a), but shall entitle the holder thereof only to such rights as
are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares.

 

(b)If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then such shares shall automatically be deemed to
have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall represent only
the right to receive any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration
otherwise payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate formerly representing such
shares in accordance with Section 1.10.

 

(c)The Company shall give the Buyer (i) prompt notice of any demand for
appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time delivered
pursuant to and in accordance with the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand
and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not settle or make any
payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any
such demand, notice or instrument unless the Buyer shall have given its prior
written consent to such settlement, payment or settlement offer. 

   

1.7Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws; Directors and Officers.

 

(a)The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time shall be amended and restated to read in its
entirety in the form attached as Exhibit D.

 

(b)The Buyer shall cause the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation to be
amended and restated in their entirety so that, immediately following the
Effective Time, they are identical to the By-laws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all references to the
name of Merger Sub therein shall be changed to refer to the name of the
Company.

 

(c)The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.8No Further Rights. From and after the Effective Time, no Company Shares
shall be deemed to be outstanding, and holders of certificates formerly
representing Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except as provided herein or by Law.

 

1.9Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Company Shares shall
thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, certificates formerly
representing Company Shares are presented to the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the applicable amounts
payable, if any, in respect of such Company Shares pursuant to Section 1.5,
subject to the provisions of Article VII and subject further to applicable Law
in the case of Dissenting Shares.

 

1.10Appointment of Payment Agent; Exchange of Shares.

 

(a)Prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall appoint Acquiom Financial LLC,
as the payments administrator (the "Payment Agent") to effect the payment and
distribution of the Aggregate Merger Consideration that becomes payable
pursuant to Section 1.5 in exchange for Company Certificates pursuant to an
agreement to be entered into prior to the Effective Time by the Payment Agent,
the Buyer and the Company Equityholder Representative in the form of Exhibit E
(the "Payment Agent Agreement"). Promptly (and in no event more than two (2)
Business Days) following the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Payment
Agent to send a notice and a letter of transmittal in the form of Exhibit F (a
"Letter of Transmittal") to each holder of a Company Certificate whose address
appears in the Company's books and records advising such holder of the
effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for surrendering to the Payment
Agent such Company Certificate in exchange for the amounts payable (or that
become payable) to such holder pursuant to Section 1.5.

 

(b)Each holder of a Company Certificate, upon surrender thereof to the Payment
Agent, together with a completed and signed Letter of Transmittal and any
other documents reasonably requested by the Payment Agent, in accordance with
the instructions set forth therein, shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (subject to Section 1.14) (i) any

   

portion of the Closing Merger Consideration payable to such holder pursuant to
Section 1.5, (ii) if any portion of any Future Payment becomes payable under
this Agreement, such holder's Equityholder Pro Rata Share of such Future
Payment to such holder pursuant to Section 1.5, and (iii) if any portion of
any Stockholder Adjustment Payment becomes payable under this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement, such holder's Stockholder Pro Rata Share of such
Stockholder Adjustment Payment to such holder pursuant to Section 1.5. Until
surrendered in accordance with this Section 1.10(b) or as otherwise
contemplated by Section 1.10(d), each Company Certificate shall be deemed for
all purposes to evidence only the right to receive the cash amounts payable
pursuant to Section 1.5.

 

(c)If any payment is to be made to or in the name of a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Company Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor
is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) the Company
Certificate so surrendered shall be transferable, and shall be properly
assigned, endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, (ii) such
transfer shall otherwise be proper, and (iii) the Person requesting such
transfer shall pay to the Payment Agent any transfer or other Taxes payable by
reason of the foregoing or establish to the satisfaction of the Payment Agent
and the Buyer that such Taxes have been paid or are not required to be paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Payment Agent nor any Party shall
be liable to a Company Stockholder for any amount payable to such Company
Stockholder pursuant to Section 1.5 that is delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 

(d)In the event any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, (ii)
delivery by such Person of an agreement (in form and substance satisfactory to
the Buyer) to indemnify the Buyer against any claim that may be made against
the Buyer with respect to the Company Certificate alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed and (iii) for any Company Certificate evidencing
consideration payable pursuant to clause (i) of Section 1.5(a) in excess of
$250,000, delivery by such Person of a bond in such sum as the Buyer may
reasonably direct the Payment Agent to require, the Payment Agent shall
deliver to the holder of Company Shares formerly represented by such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the cash amounts payable (or that may
become payable), if any, pursuant to Section 1.5.

 

(e)Any amount made available to the Payment Agent in accordance with this
Agreement that remains unclaimed by the Person entitled to such amount six (6)
months after such amount is made available to the Payment Agent shall be
returned to the Buyer and any Person who has not completed the exchange
procedures set forth in this Section 1.10 shall thereafter look only to the
Buyer for delivery of the portion of the consideration that such Person is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5, without any interest thereon.

 

1.11Company Equityholder Representative.

 

(a)By (i) their (A) execution of a Letter of Transmittal, Option Surrender
Agreement and/or Warrant Surrender Agreement, (B) approval of the Merger and
adoption of this Agreement and/or (C) participation in the Merger and receipt
of the benefits thereof, including the right to receive any consideration
pursuant to this Agreement, and/or (ii) the consummation of the

   

Merger, each of the Company Equityholders (as of the Effective Time) shall be
deemed to have approved the designation of, and hereby irrevocably (subject
only to Section 1.11(e)) appoints Shareholder Representative Services LLC as
the representative, attorney-in-fact and agent of the Company Equityholders
for all purposes in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Payment Agent Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and in any
litigation or arbitration involving this Agreement, the Payment Agent
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and any agreements ancillary hereto or
thereto. In connection with such designation and appointment, the Company
Equityholder Representative, from and after the Closing, is authorized to do
or refrain from doing all further acts and things, and to execute all such
documents as the Company Equityholder Representative shall deem necessary or
appropriate, and, without limitation of the foregoing, shall have the power
and authority to:

 

(i)act for some or all of the Company Equityholders with regard to all matters
pertaining to this Agreement, the Payment Agent Agreement and/or the Escrow
Agreement;

 

(ii)receive the Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount to be used
for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(iii)give and receive all notices on behalf of the Company Equityholders
required or contemplated to be given under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and/or the Payment Agent Agreement;

 

(iv)on behalf of the Company Equityholders, negotiate, resolve and settle any
disputes or claims regarding the Adjustment Amount (or any component thereof),
achievement of the Milestone Events, the determination of any Milestone
Payment and any claims for indemnification under Article VII; 

 

(v)act for the Company Equityholders to transact matters of litigation;

 

(vi)execute and deliver all amendments, waivers, ancillary agreements,
certificates and documents that the Company Equityholder Representative deems
necessary or appropriate in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Payment Agent Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement, including delivering any update to or correction,
amendment or modification of the Allocation Schedule permitted by Section
1.16;

 

(vii)do or refrain from doing, on behalf of the Company Equityholders, any
further act or deed that the Company Equityholder Representative deems
necessary or appropriate in the Company Equityholder Representative's
discretion relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, the Payment Agent
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, in each case as fully and completely as the
Company Equityholders could do or refrain from doing if personally present;

 

(viii)on behalf of the Company Equityholders, give any written direction to
the Payment Agent or the Escrow Agent; and

   

(ix)on behalf of all Company Equityholders, receive service of process in
connection with any claims under this Agreement, the Payment Agent Agreement
and/or the Escrow Agreement.

 

(b)All decisions and actions of the Company Equityholder Representative on
behalf of the Company Equityholders shall be deemed to be facts ascertainable
outside of this Agreement and shall be binding upon all Company Equityholders,
and no Company Equityholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest
or otherwise contest the same.

 

(c)At the Effective Time, the Buyer shall pay the Company Equityholder
Representative Expense Amount to the Company Equityholder Representative,
which Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount shall be maintained
by the Company Equityholder Representative in a segregated account, which will
be used solely for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Company
Equityholder Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this
Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto. The Company Equityholders will
not receive any interest or earnings on the Company Equityholder
Representative Expense Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Company Equityholder Representative any ownership right that they may
otherwise have had in such interest or earnings. The Company Equityholder
Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of the Company
Equityholder Representative Expense Amount other than as a result of its gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Company Equityholder Representative will
hold the Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount separate from its
corporate funds, will not use the Company Equityholder Representative Expense
Amount for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not
voluntarily make the Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. Upon the determination
of the Company Equityholder Representative that retaining any portion of the
Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount is no longer necessary, the
Company Equityholder Representative shall deliver any then remaining portion
of the Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount (the "Company
Equityholder Representative Account Payment") in accordance with Section 1.16.
For Tax purposes, the Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount will
be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Company
Stockholders at the time of Closing. 

 

(d)The Company Equityholder Representative shall act for the Company
Equityholders on all of the matters set forth in this Agreement, the Payment
Agent Agreement and the Escrow Agreement in the manner that the Company
Equityholder Representative believes to be in the best interest of the Company
Equityholders. The Company Equityholder Representative is authorized to act
on behalf of the Company Equityholders notwithstanding any dispute or
disagreement among the Company Equityholders (or any of them). In taking any
action as Company Equityholder Representative, the Company Equityholder
Representative may rely conclusively, without any further inquiry or
investigation, upon any certification or confirmation, oral or written, given
by any Person whom the Company Equityholder Representative reasonably believes
to be authorized thereunto. The Company Equityholder Representative may, in
all questions arising hereunder, rely on the advice of counsel, and the
Company Equityholder Representative shall not be liable to any of the Parties
or to any Company Equityholder for anything done, omitted or suffered in good
faith by the Company Equityholder Representative based on such advice. The
Company Equityholder Representative undertakes to perform such

   

duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement
and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement
against the Company Equityholder Representative. The Company Equityholder
Representative will incur no liability of any kind with respect to any action
or omission by the Company Equityholder Representative in connection with the
Company Equityholder Representative's services pursuant to this Agreement and
any agreements ancillary hereto, except in the event of liability directly
resulting from the Company Equityholder Representative's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Company Equityholders will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Company Equityholder Representative from and against any and all
losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions,
fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and
experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and
shipment) (collectively, "Representative Losses") arising out of or in
connection with the Company Equityholder Representative's execution and
performance of this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each
case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that in
the event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have
been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Company Equityholder Representative, the Company Equityholder Representative
will reimburse the Company Equityholders in the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Company Equityholder
Representative by the Company Equityholders, any such Representative Losses
may be recovered by the Company Equityholder Representative from (i) the
Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount, (ii) any amounts in the
Escrow Fund at such time as any such amounts would otherwise be payable to the
Company Equityholders and (iii) any Milestone Consideration at such time as
any such amounts would otherwise be payable to the Company Equityholders;
provided, that while this section allows the Company Equityholder
Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of funds, this does
not relieve the Company Equityholders from their obligation to promptly pay
such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it
prevent the Company Equityholder Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it against the Company Equityholders at law or otherwise (it
being understood that the Company Equityholder Representative shall have no
recourse against the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company)
for any such Representative Losses or otherwise). In no event will the
Company Equityholder Representative be required to advance its own funds on
behalf of the Company Equityholders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability
or indemnification obligations of, or provisions limiting the recourse against
non-parties otherwise applicable to, the Company Equityholders set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the
indemnities provided to the Company Equityholder Representative under this
Section 1.11(d). The foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the
resignation or removal of the Company Equityholder Representative or the
termination of this Agreement.

 

(e)The Company Equityholder Representative may resign at any time. In the
event the Company Equityholder Representative becomes unable to perform the
Company Equityholder Representative's responsibilities hereunder or resigns
from such position, the Company Equityholders (acting by a written instrument
signed by those Company Equityholders set forth on Schedule 1.11(e) (the
"Representative Committee") shall select another representative to fill the
vacancy of the Company Equityholder Representative within ninety (90) days
after such inability to perform or resignation, and such substituted
representative shall, upon notice to the Buyer, be deemed to be the Company
Equityholder Representative for all purposes of this

   

Agreement; provided that, if, within ninety (90) days after such inability to
perform or resignation, such signed written instrument from the Representative
Committee is not obtained, Adam Rosenberg shall be deemed the Company
Equityholder Representative until the Representative Committee appoints a
successor. The Company Equityholder Representative may be removed only upon
delivery of written instrument to the Buyer signed by the Representative
Committee appointing a successor Company Equityholder Representative.

 

(f)For all purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i)from and after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on the instructions and decisions of the Company Equityholder
Representative as to all matters arising under this Agreement, including the
settlement of any disputes or claims under this Agreement, or any other
actions required or permitted to be taken by the Company Equityholder
Representative hereunder, and no Party or any Company Equityholder shall have
any cause of action against the Buyer for any action taken by the Buyer in
reliance upon the instructions or decisions of the Company Equityholder
Representative, absent manifest error;

 

(ii)the provisions of this Section 1.11 (and the power and authority granted
to the Company Equityholder Representative hereunder) are independent and
severable, are irrevocable (subject only to Section 1.11(e)) and coupled with
an interest sufficient at law to support an irrevocable power and shall be
enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Company
Equityholder may have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and

 

(iii)the provisions of this Section 1.11 shall be binding upon the executors,
heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor trustees and
successors of each Company Equityholder, and any references in this Agreement
to a Company Equityholder shall mean and include the successors to the rights
of each applicable Company Equityholder hereunder, whether pursuant to
testamentary disposition, the laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

 

1.12Post-Closing Adjustment. The Closing Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted after the Closing as follows:

 

(a)Within [**] following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver, or cause
to be delivered, to the Company Equityholder Representative an unaudited
balance sheet of the Company (the "Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet") as
of the Closing prepared in accordance with GAAP and in the form and format of
Exhibit C, together with the Buyer's calculation of the Adjustment Amount (and
each component thereof) based on the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet.

 

(b)Subject to the resolution of any disputes pursuant to this Section 1.12,
within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final Closing
Date Balance Sheet (as defined below), (i) if the Adjustment Amount is
negative, the Buyer shall be entitled to a payment in an amount equal to the
Adjustment Amount, which shall be treated as a downward adjustment to the
Closing Merger Consideration for Tax purposes and (ii) if the Adjustment
Amount is positive, the Company Equityholders shall be entitled to a payment
from the Buyer in an aggregate amount equal to the Adjustment Amount, which
shall be treated as an upward adjustment to the Closing Merger Consideration
for Tax purposes.

   

(c)If the Buyer is entitled to a payment pursuant to Section 1.12(b), the
Buyer and the Company Equityholder Representative shall, within two (2)
Business Days after the determination of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet,
deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint instruction letter signed by each such
Party instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse from the Escrow Fund an amount
in cash equal to the Adjustment Amount to one or more accounts designated by
the Buyer. If the Adjustment Amount exceeds the available Escrow Fund (as
reduced by claims for indemnification pursuant to Article VII which have
previously been satisfied from the Escrow Amount), the Company Equityholders
shall immediately pay the Buyer their respective Equityholder Pro Rata Share
of the amount of such excess. If the Company Equityholders are entitled to a
payment pursuant to Section 1.12(b), the Buyer shall pay the Adjustment Amount
in accordance with Section 1.16.

 

(d)As of the thirtieth (30th) day following the delivery thereof to the
Company Equityholder Representative, the Preliminary Closing Date Balance
Sheet shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties and all Company
Equityholders for purposes of this Section 1.12 unless, prior to such
thirtieth (30th) day, the Company Equityholder Representative shall have
notified the Buyer in writing of each item on the Preliminary Closing Date
Balance Sheet disputed by the Company Equityholder Representative, specifying
the amount thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the
basis for such dispute. In the event of such a dispute, the Buyer and the
Company Equityholder Representative shall work in good faith to reconcile
their differences. If the Buyer and the Company Equityholder Representative
are unable to reach a resolution within twenty (20) days after receipt by the
Buyer of the Company Equityholder Representative's written notice of such
dispute, the Buyer and the Company Equityholder Representative shall submit
the items remaining in dispute for resolution to the Neutral Accountant, which
shall, within thirty (30) days of such submission, determine and report to the
Company Equityholder Representative and the Buyer upon such remaining disputed
items, and such report shall be final, binding and conclusive on all Parties
and the Company Equityholders, absent manifest error. In resolving any
disputed items, the Neutral Accountant shall apply the accounting principles
described in Section 1.12(a) and, with respect to each disputed item, the
Neutral Accountant shall select a value that is equal to (or between) the
respective values presented by the Buyer and the Company Equityholder
Representative. The Neutral Accountant shall act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator. A Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet that has either not been
challenged, has been reconciled by the Parties, or has been revised by the
Neutral Accountant to reflect its determinations pursuant to this Section
1.12, is referred to herein as the "Final Closing Date Balance Sheet" and
shall be final, binding and conclusive on all Parties and the Company
Equityholders for purposes of this Section 1.12. The fees and disbursements
of the Neutral Accountant shall be allocated equally between the Buyer, on the
one hand, and the Company Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the
Company Equityholders), on the other hand. The Parties agree that the
procedures set forth in this Section 1.12(d) for resolving disputes with
respect to the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet or the calculation of
the Adjustment Amount shall be the sole and exclusive procedures for resolving
any such disputes, provided that nothing herein shall preclude any Party from
instituting litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the
determination of the Neutral Accountant or any agreement of the Parties with
respect to the resolution of any such dispute and nothing herein shall limit
or impair any of the Buyer's rights or remedies under Article VII.

   

(e)All amounts paid pursuant to this Section 1.12 shall be treated as
adjustments to the Aggregate Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes unless
otherwise required by Law.

 

1.13Treatment of Company Options, Company Restricted Shares and Company
Warrants.

 

(a)Company Options. As of the Effective Time, each Company Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether
vested or unvested), shall be canceled without any action on the part of any
holder of such Company Option in consideration for the right to receive,
subject to the execution and delivery by the holder of such Company Option of
an Option Surrender Agreement with respect thereto and to any withholding in
accordance with Section 1.14, in full satisfaction of the rights of such
holder with respect thereto, (i) no later than the first ordinary payroll of
the Company the cutoff date for which is at least ten (10) Business Days after
the Effective Time, the cash amount (without interest) equal to such Company
Option's Equityholder Pro Rata Share of the Closing Merger Consideration,
minus (B) the aggregate exercise price of such Company Option, plus (ii) no
later than thirty (30) days after any Future Payment becomes payable in
accordance with this Agreement, the cash amount (without interest) equal to
such Company Option's Equityholder Pro Rata Share of such Future Payment.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary or
desirable in connection with the treatment of Company Options contemplated by
this Section 1.13(a). 

 

(b)Company Restricted Shares. As of the Effective Time, any Company
Restricted Share that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall become vested in full and shall be treated in accordance
with Section 1.5(a).

 

(c)Company Warrants. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
action necessary to cause the holder of each Company Warrant that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time to execute a warrant
surrender agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G (a "Warrant
Surrender Agreement"). Each such Company Warrant shall be exercised in full
for cash as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the
terms thereof and the shares issued thereupon shall be treated as Company
Shares in accordance with Section 1.5(a).

   

1.14Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, each of the
Buyer and the Surviving Corporation, the Payment Agent and the Escrow Agent
will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person, such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any other Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted or withheld, and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity,
such deducted or withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

 

1.15Milestone Payments. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, including
Section 1.15(b) hereof, the Company Equityholders shall be entitled to certain
contingent cash payments determined as set forth below (collectively, the
"Milestone Consideration"):

 

(a)Milestone Payments. The Buyer shall notify the Company Equityholder
Representative in writing of the first achievement following the Closing by
any member of the Milestone Rights Group of any milestone event set forth

Milestone Event, and, subject to Section 1.15(b), a one-time, cash payment in
the amount set forth below corresponding to such Milestone Event and the
applicable Milestone Product (each, a "Milestone Payment") shall be paid by
the Buyer no later than thirty (30) days following such notification by the
Buyer. The Buyer shall pay interest on any Milestone Payment that is not paid
on or before the date such payment is due under this this Agreement at an
annual rate equal to [**] in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made, calculated on the total number of days payment is delinquent
(provided that no interest shall accrue on amounts disputed in good faith by
the Buyer).

(i)After the Closing Date, the Buyer will (directly or indirectly through
other members of the Milestone Rights Group) use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to [**]. The Buyer will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to [**].

 

(ii)[**]. Each of the Milestone Payments shall become payable upon the
occurrence of the associated Development Milestone Event or Sales Milestone
Event, as applicable, irrespective of the order in which the Development
Milestone Event or Sales Milestone Event occur relative to each other. Each
Milestone Payment will be non-refundable and non-creditable and not subject to
set-off, subject to the rights of the Buyer under Article VII, including
Section 7.6.

 

(iii)[**], the Buyer shall provide the Company Equityholder Representative, by
[**].

 

(iv)The Buyer shall keep, and shall cause the other members of the Milestone
Rights Group to keep, adequate books and records of accounting for the purpose
of confirming whether any Sales Milestone Event has occurred for a period of
[**] following the end of the Calendar Year to which such books and records
pertain.

 

(v)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer, in
its sole discretion, will determine whether [**] has been achieved for any
Milestone Product for any Indication within [**]; provided that,
notwithstanding the Buyer's determination under subsections (a) and (b) of the
definition of [**] based on the definition thereof, should the Buyer later
decide to progress such Milestone Product into a [**] for an Indication, such
decision will constitute a [**] in such Milestone Product for such Indication.

 

(vi)No Milestone Payment shall be payable more than once, whether achieved for
[**]. For clarity, in the event that more than one of the Sales Milestone
Events is achieved for the first time in any Calendar Year, the Buyer shall
pay the amount allocated for each Sales Milestone Event so achieved during
such Calendar Year. If a Development Milestone Event for an Indication is
skipped but a subsequent Development Milestone Event is achieved by a
Milestone Product in such Indication, then all prior unachieved Development
Milestone Events that would otherwise have been achieved by such Milestone
Product for such Indication will be deemed achieved. The Buyer will notify
the Company Equityholder Representative within [**] of (i) the failure to
achieve any Development Milestone Event or (ii) any decision to halt
development of [**].

   

(vii)Each of the Company Equityholders, by his, her or its execution of a
Written Consent, an Option Surrender Agreement, a Warrant Surrender Agreement,
a Letter of Transmittal and/or receipt of Aggregate Merger Consideration
hereunder, acknowledges and agrees that, subject only to Section 1.15(b)(i),
(A) the Buyer shall be entitled to conduct the business of the Buyer and its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the business of the Company and
including in each case with respect to the Milestone Products) in a manner
that is in the best interests of the Buyer and its and Parent's stockholders
and the Buyer shall have the absolute right and sole and absolute discretion
to operate and otherwise make decisions with respect to the conduct of the
business of the Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
business of the Company and including in each case with respect to the
Milestone Products) and to take or refrain from taking any action with respect
thereto; (B) the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer may currently or in the
future offer products or services that compete, either directly or indirectly,
with the Milestone Products and may make decisions with respect to such
products and services that may adversely affect the achievement of one or more
of the Milestone Events (including ceasing development of the Milestone
Products); and (C) absent a breach by the Buyer of this Agreement, neither the
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall have any liability whatsoever to any
Company Equityholder or any other Person for any claim, loss or damage of any
nature that arises out of or relates in any way to any decisions or actions
affecting whether or not or the extent to which the Milestone Consideration
becomes payable in accordance with this Section 1.15.

 

(viii)The Buyer's maximum aggregate liability for any and all breaches by the
Buyer of its obligations under this Section 1.15 shall be limited to the
unpaid portion, if any, of any Milestone Consideration. Nothing herein or
elsewhere shall constitute a guarantee by the Buyer of the achievement of any
or all of the Milestone Events or the payment of any or all of the Milestone
Consideration. Neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates or any of its or
their respective representatives has made any representation or warranty
whatsoever, express or implied, regarding the Milestone Consideration, the
Milestone Events or the achievement thereof, and no Person has relied on any
projections, estimates, forecasts, business plans or other information
provided by the Buyer with respect to any of the foregoing or otherwise.

 

(ix)The right of any Company Equityholder to receive any amounts with respect
to Milestone Consideration (A) shall not be evidenced by a certificate or
other instrument, (B) shall not be assignable or otherwise transferable by
such Company Equityholder, except by will, intestacy, upon death or by
operation of Law, or to an Affiliate of such Company Equityholder for no

Representative with respect to such Tax Returns.

   

(d)The Company Equityholders severally and not jointly shall pay any transfer,
sales, use, stamp, conveyance, value added, recording, registration,
documentary, filing and other non-income Taxes and administrative fees
(including notary fees) arising in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by such Company Equityholder
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes"). The Company Equityholders will file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes,
fees and charges and, if required by applicable law, the Buyer will join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. 

 

5.2Allocation of Certain Taxes. 

 

(a)The Buyer and the Company shall not take any action, or permit any action
to be taken, that may prevent the tax year of the Company from ending for U.S.
federal and state income Tax purposes at the end of the day on which the
Closing occurs.

 

(b)The portion of any Taxes for a taxable period beginning before and ending
after the Closing allocable to the portion of such period ending on the
Closing Date shall be deemed to equal (i) in the case of Taxes that (x) are
based upon or related to income or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with
any sale or other transfer or assignment of property, other than Taxes
described in Section 5.1(d), the amount which would be payable if the taxable
year ended with the Closing Date, and (ii) in the case of other Taxes imposed
on a periodic basis (including property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for
the entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the period ending with the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period. For
purposes of computing the Taxes attributable to the two portions of a taxable
period, the amount of any item that is taken into account only once for each
taxable period (e.g., the benefit of graduated tax rates, exemption amounts,
etc.) shall be allocated between the two portions of the period in proportion
to the number of days in each portion.

 

5.3Cooperation on Tax Matters; Tax Audits.

 

(a)The Buyer and the Company Equityholders and their respective Affiliates
shall cooperate in the preparation of all Tax Returns and the conduct of all
Tax audits or other Legal Proceedings relating to the determination of any Tax
for any Tax periods for which one Party could reasonably require the
assistance of the other Party in obtaining any necessary information. 

 

(b)The Buyer shall have the right to control any Tax audit, initiate any claim
for refund, and contest, resolve and defend against any assessment, notice of
deficiency, or other adjustment or proposed adjustment relating to Taxes with
respect to the Company; provided that, with respect to any item the adjustment
of which may cause the Company Equityholders to become obligated to make any
payment pursuant to this Agreement, the Buyer shall (i) consult with the
Company Equityholder Representative with respect to the resolution of any
issue that would affect the Company Equityholders, (ii) allow the Company
Equityholder Representative to participate in the conduct, defense and
resolution of any such issue at the Company Equityholders' expense, and (iii)
not settle any such issue without the consent of the Company Equityholder
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

   

5.4Post-Closing Actions. The Buyer and the Surviving Corporation will not
(and will not permit their respective Affiliates to), except initial filings
in accordance with Section 5.1, (i) file or amend any Tax Return of the
Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) make or change any
Tax election or change any method of accounting or adopt any convention that
has retroactive effect to any Tax Return of the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (iii) agree to extend or waive the statute of limitations with respect
to Taxes of the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iv) initiate
discussions or examinations with Governmental Entities regarding Taxes with
respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, or (v) make any voluntary disclosures with
respect to Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, in each case, if such action
could result in an increase in the Tax liabilities of the Company taken into
account in determining the Closing Merger Consideration, as finally
determined, or could form the basis of a claim for indemnification against the
Company Equityholders pursuant to this Agreement, provided, however, that the
Buyer may take any such action with the prior written consent of the Company
Equityholder Representative, which consent shall not be not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

5.5No Code Section 336 or Section 338 Election. The Buyer and its Affiliates
shall not make any election under Section 336 or Section 338 of the Code (or
any similar provision under state, local or foreign Law) with respect to the
acquisition of the Company pursuant to this Agreement.

 

5.6Refunds. The Company Equityholders shall be entitled to the amount of any
refund (or credit for overpayment of Tax in lieu thereof) of all Taxes [**].
Promptly upon receipt of any such Tax refund (or application of such credit),
and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt by the Buyer,
the Company, the Surviving Entity or any of their Affiliates, the Buyer will
deliver and pay over, or cause to be delivered and paid over, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, such Tax refunds or credits, including any
interest thereon, less any required Tax withholding, to the Payment Agent (on
behalf of the Company Equityholders for payment to each Company Equityholder
of its Equityholder Pro Rata Share of such Tax refunds or credit). The Buyer
will endeavor in good faith, if the Company Equityholder Representative so
requests and at the Company Equityholders' sole expense, to assist the Company
Equityholder Representative in obtaining any material refunds or credits to
which the Company Equityholders are entitled hereunder unless the Buyer
reasonably determines that any such action could give rise to an adverse Tax
effect to the Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company) in a Post-
Closing Tax Period. To the extent such refund (or credit) is subsequently
disallowed or required to be returned to the applicable taxing authority, the
Company Equityholders agree promptly to repay the amount of such refund (or
credit), together with any interest, penalties or other additional amounts
imposed by such taxing authority, to the Buyer.

7.3Indemnification Claims.

 

(a)The Indemnified Party shall give written notification to the Indemnifying
Party of the commencement of any Third-Party Action that the Indemnified Party
expects may result in a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article
VII. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Indemnifying Party" shall mean (A)
in the case of a claim for indemnification by the Buyer, the Company
Equityholder Representative on behalf of the Company Equityholders (except for
provisions relating to an obligation to make or a right to receive any
payments) and (B) in the case of a claim for indemnification by any Company
Equityholder, the Buyer and (ii) "Indemnified Party" shall mean (A) in the
case of a claim for indemnification against the Buyer, the Company
Equityholder Representative on behalf of the applicable Company Equityholder
or Company Equityholders (except for provisions relating to an obligation to
make or a right to receive any payments) and (B) in all other cases, the
Buyer. Such notification shall be given within twenty (20) calendar days
after receipt by the Indemnified Party of notice of such Third-Party Action,
and shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known by the
Indemnified Party) the facts constituting the basis for such Third-Party
Action and the amount of the claimed damages; provided, however, that no delay
or failure on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the
Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability or
obligation hereunder except to the extent of any damage or liability caused by
or arising out of such failure.

 

(b)The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its own and sole expense (and
in the case of the Company Equityholder Representative, at the Company
Equityholders' expense), to participate in any defense of such Third-Party
Action, or by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within twenty
(20) days after delivery of the written notification described in Section
7.3(a), to assume the defense of any Third-Party Action at the Indemnifying
Party's expense (and in the case of the Company Equityholder Representative,
at the Company Equityholders' expense), and by the Indemnifying Party's own
counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such
defense (it being understood that, prior to and during such twenty (20)-day
period, the Indemnified Party is hereby authorized (but not obligated) to file
any

   

motion, answer or other pleading and to take any other action which the
Indemnified Party shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect the
Indemnified Party's interests in connection with such Third-Party Action);
provided that (i) the Indemnifying Party may only assume control of such
defense if (A) it acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party that any
damages, fines, costs or other liabilities that may be assessed against the
Indemnified Party in connection with such Third-Party Action constitute Losses
for which the Indemnified Party shall be indemnified fully pursuant to this
Article VII, (B) if the Buyer is the Indemnified Party, the ad damnum in such
Third-Party Action, taken together with the estimated costs of defense thereof
and the Claimed Amount with respect to any unresolved claims for
indemnification then pending, is less than or equal to the current balance of
the Escrow Fund, and (C) if the Buyer is the Indemnified Party, an adverse
resolution of the Third-Party Action would not have a material adverse effect
on the goodwill or reputation of the Buyer or the business, operations or
future conduct of the Buyer and (ii) if the Buyer is the Indemnified Party,
the Company Equityholder Representative may not assume control of the defense
of any Third-Party Action involving Taxes, any Governmental Entity or criminal
liability or in which equitable relief is sought against the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates. If the Indemnifying Party does not, or is not permitted under
the terms hereof to, so assume control of the defense of a Third-Party Action,
the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The Non-controlling Party
may participate in such defense at its own expense (in the case of the Company
Equityholder Representative, at the Company Equityholders' expense). The
Controlling Party shall thereafter from time to time promptly provide to the
Non-controlling Party copies of all pleadings filed and all orders issued in
such Third-Party Action, and shall consult in good faith with the Non-
controlling Party at reasonable periodic intervals on matters regarding the
defense of such Third-Party Action. The fees and expenses of counsel to the
Indemnified Party with respect to a Third-Party Action shall be considered
Losses for purposes of this Agreement if (x) the Indemnified Party controls
the defense of such Third-Party Action pursuant to the terms of Section 5.3(b)
or this Section 7.3(b) or (y) the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such
defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests or different
defenses available with respect to such Third-Party Action (in which case the
fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party will only be considered
Losses to the extent they relate to or are incurred as a result of those
matters involving such conflicting interests or different defenses). The
Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any Third-Party Action without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; provided that the consent of the Indemnified Party
shall not be required if the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to pay any
amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or judgment and such settlement or
judgment includes a complete release of the Indemnified Party from further
liability and imposes no obligation on the Indemnified Party. Except as
provided in Section 7.3(f), the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third-Party
Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent
there is any conflict between the provisions of this Section 7.3(b) and
Section 5.3(b) with regard to any Third-Party Action involving Taxes, Section
5.3(b) shall govern.

 

(c)In order to seek indemnification under this Article VII, the Indemnified
Party shall deliver a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party.

   

(d)Within twenty (20) Business Days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a Response, in which
the Indemnifying Party shall either: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive the Claimed Amount or a portion of the Claimed Amount or
(ii) dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the
Claimed Amount. If no Response is delivered by the Indemnifying Party within
such twenty (20)-Business Day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed
to have agreed that all of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnified
Party. Acceptance by the Indemnified Party of partial payment of any Claimed
Amount shall be without prejudice to its right to claim the balance of any
such Claimed Amount.

 

(e)Except in cases of disputes regarding the determination of the Adjustment
Amount (which shall be resolved exclusively in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Section 1.12), any Dispute shall be resolved in accordance with
Section 10.12. The Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party,
promptly following the resolution of the Dispute (whether by mutual agreement,
arbitration, judicial decision or otherwise), payment of any amount required
to be paid to the Indemnified Party consistent with the terms of the
resolution of the Dispute. If the Buyer seeks to enforce any claim that is
the subject of the Dispute pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Company
Equityholder Representative and the Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent,
promptly following the resolution of the Dispute (whether by mutual agreement,
judicial decision or otherwise), a written notice executed by both Parties
instructing the Escrow Agent as to what (if any) portion of the Escrow Fund
shall be distributed to the Buyer (which notice shall be consistent with the
terms of the resolution of the Dispute).

 

(f)Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 7.3, if a third party
asserts (other than by means of a lawsuit) that the Indemnified Party is
liable to such third party for a monetary or other obligation which may
constitute or result in Losses for which the Indemnified Party may be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Article VII, and the Indemnified Party
reasonably determines that it has a valid business reason to fulfill such
obligation, then (i) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to satisfy such
obligation, without prior notice to or consent from the Indemnifying Party,
(ii) the Indemnified Party may subsequently make a claim for indemnification
in accordance with the provisions of this Article VII, and (iii) the
Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed, in accordance with the provisions of
this Article VII, for any such Losses for which it is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article VII (subject to the right of the
Indemnifying Party to dispute the Indemnified Party's entitlement to
indemnification, or the amount for which it is entitled to indemnification,
under the terms of this Article VII).

 

(g)Without limitation of Section 1.11, (i) the Company Equityholder
Representative shall have full and exclusive power and authority on behalf of
each Company Equityholder to take any and all actions on behalf of, execute
any and all instruments on behalf of, and execute or waive any and all rights
of, the Company Equityholders under this Article VII; and (ii) the Company
Equityholder Representative shall have no liability to any Company
Equityholder for any action taken or omitted on behalf of the Company
Equityholders pursuant to this Article VII. For the avoidance of doubt, no
Person other than a Party may assert a claim for indemnification under this
Article VII.

   

7.4Survival of Representations and Warranties. Each Party's representations
and warranties in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and, except in
cases of Fraud, shall expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on [**]; provided,
however, that the representations and warranties contained in Sections 2.1
(Organization, Qualification and Corporate Power), 2.2 (Capitalization),
2.3(a) (Authorization of Transaction), 2.4(a) (Non-Contravention with Charter
Documents), 2.5 (Subsidiaries), 2.9 (Tax Matters), 2.12(c) (Intellectual
Property \- Ownership), 2.21 (Permits and Regulatory Matters), 2.24 (Certain
Business Relationships With Affiliates), 2.25 (Brokers' Fees) and 2.28
(Company Debt) (collectively, the "Fundamental Representations") shall survive
the Closing until [**]. If an Indemnified Party delivers to the Indemnifying
Party, before expiration of a representation or warranty a Claim Notice based
upon a breach of such representation or warranty, then the applicable
representation or warranty shall survive until, but only for purposes of, the
resolution of any claims arising from or related to the matter covered by such
notice. The rights to indemnification set forth in this Article VII shall not
be affected by (a) any investigation or due diligence conducted by or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) by the Indemnified Party, whether before or after the date of this
Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the inaccuracy or noncompliance
with any representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or otherwise which is

the extent not utilized to pay the Buyer for any such claims resolved in favor
of the Buyer) upon their final and binding resolution in accordance with this
Article VII and the Escrow Agreement.

self-insurance program or similar arrangement) with respect to such Losses,
and the net of any costs to recover such amounts.

 

(b)Any Losses for indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined

constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement.

Consideration for all Tax purposes unless otherwise required by Law.

ARTICLE X 
MISCELLANEOUS

 

10.1Press Releases and Announcements. Neither the Company Equityholder
Representative nor, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall issue any
press release or make any public statement relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement without the prior written approval of the Buyer. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Buyer may issue a press release, styled as a joint press
release, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, provided that the
Buyer shall furnish a copy of such press release to the Company prior to the
public release thereof and shall consider in good faith the comments of the
Company thereon.

 

10.2Further Assurances; Post-Closing Cooperation. At any time or from time to
time after the Closing, at the request of any Party, the other Parties shall
execute and deliver to the requesting Party such other documents and
instruments, provide such materials and information and take such other
actions as the requesting Party may reasonably request to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to cause the other
Party or Parties to fulfill its or their respective obligations under this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

10.3Third-Party Beneficiaries. The terms and provisions of this Agreement are
intended solely for the benefit of the Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Company Equityholder Representative and their respective successors or
permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the parties to confer third-
party beneficiary rights, and this Agreement does not confer any such rights,
upon any other Person. For the avoidance of doubt, no Person other than a
Party may assert any claim or initiate any Legal Proceeding to enforce any
provision of this Agreement.

 

10.4Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents referred to
herein) constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties and supersedes any
prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the Parties,
written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided that the
Mutual Confidentiality Agreement, dated [**], between [**] and the Company, as
amended [**], shall remain in effect until the Effective Time, at which time
it shall expire.

 

10.5Succession and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. No Party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of
its performance obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of
the other Parties; provided that (a) the Buyer or Merger Sub may (without the
consent of the other Parties) assign its rights, interests and obligations
hereunder to an Affiliate of the Buyer, as long as the Buyer provides written
notice to the Company (prior to the Effective Time) or the Company
Equityholder Representative (at or after the Effective Time) of such
assignment and such Affiliate thereof agrees in writing to assume and be bound
as the Buyer hereunder; provided that no such assignment shall relieve the
Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder, (b) the Buyer may (without the
consent of the other Parties) assign all of its rights and obligations
hereunder to any acquirer in connection with a Parent Change in Control or
Buyer Change in Control; provided that no such assignment shall relieve the
Buyer's successor-in-interest of any of Buyers' obligations hereunder; and (c)
the Buyer may (without the consent of the other Parties) assign any or all of
its rights and obligations under this Agreement to a Transferee in connection
with a Divestiture; provided that no such assignment to a Transferee shall
relieve the Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder (except as otherwise
provided in Section 1.15(d)). 

   

Any purported assignment of rights or delegation of performance obligations in
violation of this Section 10.5 is void. 

 

10.6Counterparts and Facsimile Signature. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement
may be executed by facsimile, pdf or DocuSign signature and a facsimile, pdf
or DocuSign signature shall constitute an original for all purposes.

 

10.7Headings. The section headings contained in this Agreement are inserted
for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 

10.8Notices. All notices, requests, demands, claims, and other communications

Any Party may give any notice, request, demand, claim or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, expedited
courier, messenger service, or ordinary mail), but no such notice, request,
demand, claim or other communication that is given by such other means shall
be deemed to have been duly given unless and until it actually is received by
the party for whom it is intended. Any Party may change the address to which
notices, requests, demands, claims, and other communications hereunder are to
be delivered by giving the other Parties notice in the manner herein set
forth.

 

10.9Amendments and Waivers. The Parties may mutually amend any provision of
this Agreement at any time in a writing and signed by Buyer and the Company,
and, only to the extent affecting the Company Equityholder Representative, the
Company Equityholder Representative, if prior to Closing, or Buyer and the
Company Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Equityholders),
if after Closing; provided, however, that any amendment effected subsequent to
the effectiveness of the Written Consent and prior to the Closing shall be
subject to any restrictions contained in the DGCL. No amendment of any
provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by all of the applicable surviving Parties. No waiver of any right
or remedy hereunder shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and
signed by the Party giving such waiver. No waiver by any Party with respect
to any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder
shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any
way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.
No amendment or waiver effected subsequent to the Closing shall be effective
against any Company Equityholder unless such amendment or waiver (a) is signed
by the Company Equityholder Representative (acting in accordance with the vote
or written consent of the Representative Committee) and (b) either (i) is
consented to in writing by such Company Equityholder or (ii) such amendment or
waiver applies to all Company Equityholders. 

 

10.10Severability; Invalid Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement is
finally judicially determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under
any present or future Law, and if the rights or obligations of any Party under
this Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such
provision shall be fully severable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and
enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never
comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom, and (d) in
lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added
automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision as may be possible.

 

10.11Governing Law. All matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (including its interpretation,
construction, performance and enforcement) shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the internal Laws of the State

   

of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision
or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdictions other than those of
the State of Delaware.

 

10.12Submission to Jurisdiction. Subject to Section 1.12(d), each Party (a)
consents to submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle County, or, if that court
does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware in
any Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in
respect of such Legal Proceeding may be heard and determined in any such
court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d)
agrees not to bring any Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
other court. Each Party waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any Legal Proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or
other security that might be required of any other party with respect thereto.
Any Party may make service on another Party by sending or delivering a copy of
the process to the Party to be served at the address and in the manner
provided for the giving of notices in Section 10.8, except in the case of
service on individual Company Equityholders, which shall be served directly on
such Company Equityholder. Nothing in this Section 10.12, however, shall
affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

 

10.13WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING HEREFROM, THE PARTIES HERETO CONSENT TO TRIAL
WITHOUT A JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY
HERETO OR ITS SUCCESSORS AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO OR ITS SUCCESSORS IN
RESPECT OF ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT,
REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION OR PROCEEDING.

 

10.14Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case without
posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief on the basis that (a) the Party seeking such remedy has
an adequate remedy at Law or (b) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity.

 

10.15Legal Representation

 

.

 

(a)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Parties
intend that all communications at or prior to the Closing between or among the
Company, Company Equityholder Representative, any member of the Seller Group,
or any of them (collectively, the "Target Group"), on the one hand, and any of
their attorneys, on the other hand,

   

to the extent relating to the negotiation of this Agreement and any
alternative transactions (collectively, the "Protected Communication") and all
associated rights to assert, waive and otherwise administer the attorney-
client privilege and right of confidentiality of any member of the Target
Group (the "Associated Rights"), will, from and after the Closing, rest
exclusively with the Company Equityholder Representative and will not be
transferred, assigned, conveyed or delivered, by operation of law or
otherwise, to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any successor or assign of
any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Buyer Group"). Accordingly, the
Parties hereby agree that, as of immediately prior to the Closing, for the
consideration set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged: (i) all
Protected Communication and Associated Rights are, and will be deemed for all
purposes, transferred, assigned, conveyed and delivered in full to the Company
Equityholder Representative, and (ii) no member of the Buyer Group will have
any right, title, interest or benefit in or to any of the Protected
Communication or any Associated Rights. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Parties acknowledge the decision of the Delaware Chancery Court in Great Hill
Equity Partners IV, LP, et al. v. SIG Growth Equity Fund, I, LLP, et al.
(Civil Action No. 7905-CS, November 15, 2013) and desire to expressly exclude
the Protected Communication and Associated Rights from the assets, rights,
privileges and benefits of the Target Group that might otherwise be
transferred or assigned to any member of the Buyer Group by operation of law
or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries and a third party (other than a Party to this Agreement or any of
their respective Affiliates) after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation
(including on behalf of its Subsidiaries) may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Goodwin
Procter LLP to such third party; provided that neither the Surviving
Corporation nor any of its Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the
prior written consent of the Company Equityholder Representative or the
Stockholders, as applicable.

 

(b)The Buyer hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of the other
members of the Buyer Group, from and after the Closing, that the Company
Equityholder Representative, at the sole cost and expense of the Company
Equityholders [**]. If and to the extent that, at any time from and after the
Closing, any member of the Buyer Group will have any right or opportunity to
assert or waive an attorney-client privilege or right of confidentiality with
respect to any Protected Communication, each member of the Buyer Group will
not, and will cause the other members of the Buyer Group not to, waive such
privilege or right of confidentiality without the prior written consent of the
Company Equityholder Representative (which consent may be withheld,
conditioned or delayed in its sole discretion).

 

10.16Guarantee. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.16, Parent
hereby guarantees (the "Guaranty") all payment obligations of the Buyer to the
extent such obligations become due and payable as set forth in this Agreement
(the "Guaranteed Obligations"). This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment, not
collection. The payment obligations of Parent are independent of the payment
obligations of the Buyer under this Agreement and a separate action or actions
may be brought against Parent. Except as otherwise provided in this Section
10.16, the Guaranty shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of (a)
any change, restructuring or termination of the existence of the Buyer, (b)
any assignment, amendment or modification of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, (c) any settlement or compromise of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, and (d) any suretyship or similar defenses available to a
guarantor, whether at equity

   

or in Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement: (i) Parent's obligation to pay or otherwise satisfy
any Guaranteed Obligation shall be subject to all of the rights, defenses and
limitations that are available to the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, (ii)
the Guaranty shall terminate as to all Guaranteed Obligations at such time as
Parent ceases to be an Affiliate of the Buyer, (iii) Parent's obligations with
respect to any Guaranteed Obligation shall terminate at such time as such
Guaranteed Obligation becomes an obligation of any Qualified Subsequent
Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement, (iv) Parent's obligations under
this Guaranty shall terminate if a Person who becomes the ultimate parent
company of the Buyer assumes such obligations in writing and (v) Parent's
obligations under this Guaranty shall terminate upon the payment of all
Milestone Payments. Subject to the foregoing, this Guaranty shall be binding
on Parent and its successors and assigns.

 

10.17Construction.

 

(a)The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language
chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any Party.

 

(b)Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or Law shall
be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
unless the context requires otherwise.

 

(c)Any reference to any Article, Section or paragraph shall be deemed to refer
to an Article, Section or paragraph of this Agreement, unless the context
clearly indicates otherwise.

 

(d)The Parties hereto agree that this Agreement is the product of negotiation
between sophisticated parties and individuals, all of whom were represented by
counsel, and each of whom had an opportunity to participate in and did
participate in the drafting of each provision hereof. Accordingly,
ambiguities in this Agreement, if any, shall not be construed strictly or in
favor of or against any Party but rather shall be given a fair and reasonable
construction without regard to the rule of contra proferentem.

 

(e)Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, (i) words of
either gender or the neuter include the other gender and the neuter, (ii)
words using the singular number also include the plural number and words using
the plural number also include the singular number, (iii) the terms "hereof,"
"herein," "hereby" and derivative or similar words refer to this entire
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Article, Section or other
subdivision, (iv) the words "include," "includes," "including" and other
similar words shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase "but not limited
to," (v) when a reference is made in this Agreement to any Exhibit or
Schedule, such reference shall be to an Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated, (vi) for any document or other item to have been
"delivered," "provided" or "made available" to the Buyer on or prior to the
date of this Agreement such document or other item must be deposited at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the date hereof into the data room heretofore
established by the Company, and (vii) all references to "dollars" or "$" shall
mean United States dollars. All accounting terms used herein and not
expressly defined herein shall have the meanings given to them under GAAP,
unless otherwise expressly stated. When used herein, the terms "third

   

party," "third-party" or "third parties" refers to any Persons other than the
Buyer, Merger Sub, Parent, the Company, the Company Equityholder
Representative and their respective Affiliates.

 

(f)The drafting and negotiation of the representations, warranties, covenants
and conditions to the obligations of the Company, the Buyer, Parent and Merger
Sub herein reflect compromises, and certain provisions may overlap with other
provisions or may address the same or similar subject matters in different
ways or for different purposes. It is the intention of the Parties that, to
the extent possible, unless provisions are by their terms mutually exclusive
and effect cannot be given to both or all such provisions, (i) the
representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions in this
Agreement shall be construed to be cumulative, (ii) each representation,
warranty, covenant and closing condition in this Agreement shall be given
full, separate and independent effect, and (iii) no limitation in or exception
to any representation, warranty, covenant or closing condition shall be
construed to limit or apply to any other representation, warranty, covenant or
closing condition unless such limitation or exception is expressly made
applicable to such other representation, warranty, covenant or closing
condition. Subject to Section 7.5(d), all remedies, either under this
Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded, shall be cumulative and not
alternative. Any disclosure in any section of the Disclosure Schedule shall
qualify only (i) the representation or warranty in the corresponding section
of Article II and (ii) any other representation or warranty in Article II to
the extent the relevance of such disclosure to such other representation or
warranty is readily apparent to the Buyer based solely on a reading of the
text of such disclosure.
