Date for the Group Companies, based on the Company Financial Statements and
consistent with the methodology for the Group Companies set forth on _Schedule
2.4_ , (collectively, the " _Closing Net Working Capital_ "). Buyers
calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital shall be determined in
accordance with GAAP applied using the accounting principles, practices and
methods that were used in the preparation of the Company Financial Statements
and consistent with the methodology for the Group Companies set forth on
_Schedule 2.4_.

 



 

(b) After receipt of the Adjustment Statement, Seller shall have thirty (30)
days to review the factual basis, mathematical calculations and accounting
methods used therein. On or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day after receipt of
the Adjustment Statement, Seller shall deliver written notice to Buyer
specifying any disputed items (the " _Initial Reconciliation Disputes_ ") and
the basis therefor and amount thereof. If Seller fails to notify Buyer of any
Initial Reconciliation Disputes on or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day after
receipt of the Adjustment Statement, then all calculations and valuations of
the Closing Net Working Capital set forth on the Adjustment Statement shall be
deemed accepted by Seller and shall be final, binding, conclusive and
nonappealable for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) If Seller notifies Buyer of any Initial Reconciliation Disputes in
accordance with _Section 2.5(b)_, then Buyer and Seller shall, over the
fifteen (15) days following the date of such notice (the " _Resolution Period_
"), attempt in good faith to resolve the Initial Reconciliation Disputes, and
any written resolution by them as to any disputed item shall be final,
binding, conclusive and nonappealable for all purposes of this Agreement. If,
at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, Buyer and Seller have not reached
an agreement on the disputed items, then all Initial Reconciliation Disputes
then remaining in dispute (the " _Final Reconciliation Disputes_ ") shall be
submitted by Seller and Buyer to an Independent Auditor upon which Buyer and
Seller shall reasonably agree prior to expiration of the Resolution Period.
All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by such
Independent Auditor pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ shall be borne by Seller,
on the one hand, and by Buyer, on the other hand, based upon the percentage
that the amount not ultimately awarded to such Party by such Independent
Auditor bears to the amount actually contested by such Party in the Final
Reconciliation Disputes. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all
other costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with resolving
any Final Reconciliation Disputes hereunder before such Independent Auditor
shall be borne by the Party incurring such cost and expense. With respect to
each disputed line item of the Closing Net Working Capital, such Independent
Auditors final determination, if not in accordance with the position of
either Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, will not be in
excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by
Buyer in its calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital or the
corresponding amounts claimed by Seller in the initial notice of any Initial
Reconciliation

 



      
 

 



 

Disputes delivered by Seller pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Independent Auditor shall not review any line item or make any
determination with respect to any matter other than the Final Reconciliation
Disputes. The Parties shall instruct the Independent Auditor to render its
reasoned written decision, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, as
soon as practicable but in no event later than sixty (60) days after its
engagement (which engagement shall be made no later than ten (10) Business
Days after the end of the Resolution Period). Such decision shall be
determined in accordance with GAAP applied using the accounting principles,
practices and methods that were used in the preparation of the Company
Financial Statements and consistent with the methodology for the Group
Companies set forth on _Schedule 2.4_ , shall be set forth in a written
statement delivered to Seller and Buyer and shall be final, binding,
conclusive and nonappealable for all purposes hereunder. Notwithstanding
anything else contained herein, no Party may assert that any award issued by
the Independent Auditor is unenforceable because it has not been timely
rendered. The term " _Final Adjustment Statement_ " shall mean the definitive
Adjustment Statement setting forth the final determination of the Closing Net
Working Capital (the " _Final Closing Net Working Capital_ ") and resulting
from (i) agreement by Seller and Buyer during the Resolution Period or
otherwise, (ii) a deemed acceptance pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_ or (iii) the
determination by an Independent Auditor in accordance with this _Section
2.5(c)_.

 



 

(d) If the Final Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital, then Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to
such excess in the manner set forth in _Section 2.5(f)_. Conversely, if the
Final Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital, then Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to such
difference in the manner set forth in _Section 2.5(f)_.

 



 

(e) For purposes of calculating Closing Net Working Capital and without
limiting the provisions of _Section 2.5(a)_ and the generality of _Section
6.3_, during the period of any dispute contemplated in this _Section 2.5_,
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide Seller with reasonable
access to the relevant books and records, facilities and employees, and their
accountants work papers, schedules and other supporting data during normal
business hours as may be reasonably requested by Seller.

 



 

(f) Any payment required pursuant to _Section 2.5(d)_ shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, in Dollars, to the account or
accounts designated by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, within five (5)
Business Days after the Final Adjustment Statement is determined by (i)
agreement by Seller and Buyer during the Resolution Period or otherwise, (ii)
a deemed acceptance pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_ or (iii) the determination
by an Independent Auditor in accordance with _Section 2.5(c)_.

its representatives and advisors have deemed necessary to enable it to make an
informed decision with respect to the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Seller has received
all materials relating to the business of the Buyer Group that it has
requested and has been afforded the opportunity to obtain any additional
information necessary to verify the accuracy of any such information or of any
representation or warranty made by Buyer herein or to otherwise evaluate the
merits of the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer has answered to Sellers
satisfaction all inquiries that Seller and its representatives and advisors
have made concerning the business of the Buyer Group or otherwise relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) In entering into this Agreement, Seller has relied solely upon its own
investigation and analysis and the representations and warranties of Buyer
expressly contained in _Article 5_ and the Buyer Certificate and Seller
acknowledges that, other than as set forth in this Agreement (as modified by
the Schedules) and the certificates or other instruments delivered pursuant
hereto, none of Buyer, the members of the Buyer Group or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, stockholders, agents or
representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty, either
express or implied, (x) as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the
information provided or made available to Seller or any of its respective
agents, representatives, lenders or Affiliates prior to the execution of this
Agreement (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, as set forth in this

or budgets of future revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of

than, for the avoidance of doubt, as set forth in this Agreement as modified
by the Schedules), and are not and shall not be deemed to be relied upon by
Seller in executing, delivering and performing this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 4.8 _Drag-Along Rights_. Seller is entitled to all of the Drag-Along
Rights (the " _Drag-Along Rights_ ") which, to the Companys knowledge, are
enforceable against the applicable parties to the 2010 UPA in accordance with
the terms and conditions set forth in the 2010 UPA, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting
generally the enforcement of creditors rights and subject to general
principles of equity. Pursuant to the terms of the 2010 UPA, Seller has the
right to designate the Company, Buyer or Buyers designee, as the " _Drag-
Along Purchaser_ " (as defined in the 2010 UPA), with all rights inuring to
such "Drag-Along Purchaser" under the 2010 UPA, without any requirement for a
consent therefor by any party to the 2010 UPA. According to the Companys good

Returns required to be filed by the Group Companies due after the Closing
Date, including Tax Returns relating to tax periods that commence before the
Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (" _Straddle Periods_ "). Such Tax

(d) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the preparation, filing and
execution of Tax Returns (including Tax Returns of Seller with respect to the
business activities of any Group Company) and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding (each a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") with respect to Taxes imposed on or
with respect to each Group Company or the assets of each Group Company for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax
Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder or to testify at any such Tax Proceeding. Seller and the Company
agree to (and, in the case of the Company, will cause the Group Companies to)
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to any
Group Company until six (6) months following the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and any extensions thereof) of the respective Pre-Closing Tax

to carry forward a net operating loss or otherwise (regardless of whether
Buyer or such Group Company otherwise is legally permitted to take such
action). Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to any Pre-Closing Tax
Refund, together with any interest thereon, received after the Closing Date
within fifteen (15) days of such receipt. A Pre-Closing Tax Refund shall be

(f) The Parties do not expect that the transfer of Membership Interests
pursuant to this Agreement will result in any state and local transfer, sales,
use, registration, stamp or other similar Taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ ").
However, if any Transfer Taxes are imposed on the transfer of the Membership
Interests pursuant to this Agreement, such Transfer Taxes shall be borne
equally by Buyer and Seller. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to
minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any
such Transfer Taxes.

normal business hours reasonable access to all books and records of the Group
Companies (in a manner so as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal
business operations of any Group Company) and the Group Companies shall
furnish promptly to Buyer and its representatives such information concerning
their business, properties, Contracts, assets, liabilities and employees as
Buyer and its representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ , that in no
event shall the foregoing include any sampling or analysis of soil,
groundwater, building materials or other environmental media of the sort
generally referred to as a Phase II environmental investigation nor may Buyer
require that such Phase II environmental investigation be conducted.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Seller, Buyer
and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as
practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
satisfaction, but not waiver, of the closing conditions set forth in _Article
7_). Each of Seller, Buyer and the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain consents of all Governmental Entities or other third parties
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including with respect to the leases included among the Material Real Property
Leases that are set forth on _Schedule 6.4_. All costs incurred in connection
with obtaining such consents shall be borne by the Party incurring such costs
and, in no event, shall Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of the Group
Companies be required to make any payments (other than routine administrative
fees, contractual change of control payments and attorneys fees) or provide
other types of consideration in order to seek or facilitate the obtaining of
any such consents.

 



 

(b) In the event any Proceeding by any Governmental Entity or other Person is
commenced which questions the validity or legality of the transactions
contemplated hereby or seeks damages in connection therewith, the Parties
agree to cooperate and use reasonable efforts to defend against such
Proceeding and, if an injunction or other order is issued in any such
Proceeding, to use commercially reasonable efforts to have such injunction or
other order lifted, and to cooperate reasonably regarding any other impediment
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) Seller and Buyer shall permit counsel for the other Party reasonable
opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other Party in connection with, any proposed written communication to any
Governmental Entity relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Seller and Buyer agrees not to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the
extent not prohibited by such

 



      
 

 



 

Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meeting or discussion.

 



 

(d) Neither Seller nor any Group Company shall have any liability to Buyer
directly arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents or
waivers (including any waivers of any rights of first refusal, rights of first
offer or similar rights) that are contained or contemplated by the Contracts
listed on _Schedule 3.6(a)_ hereto in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or because of the termination of any contract
as a result thereof, and no such failure or termination shall result in the
failure of any condition set forth in _Article 7_.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Public Announcements_. Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company
and Seller, on the other hand, shall consult with one another and seek one
anothers prior written consent before issuing any press release, or otherwise
making any public statements, with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation and prior written consent;
_provided_ that each Party may make any such announcement which it in good
faith believes, based on advice of counsel, is necessary in connection with

Seller (at Sellers expense) during normal business hours of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, upon reasonable request and upon

fact, circumstance, event or action the existence, occurrence or taking of
which has resulted in, or would reasonably be expected to result in, any

circumstance, event or action underlying such breach has occurred on or prior
to the date hereof, or (iii) any fact, circumstance, event or action the
existence, occurrence or taking of which has resulted in, or would reasonably
be expected to result in, the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
_Article 7_ to be satisfied.

covenants required to be performed or complied with by the Company or Seller
under this Agreement, and each such Update shall be deemed to be an amendment
to this Agreement for all purposes hereof other than for purposes of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_; _provided_ that, in the event that the
disclosure of the facts, circumstances and events included in such Update
would give Buyer the right to elect to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)_ if the 20-day cure period described therein had lapsed and
Buyer does not make such election within ten (10) Business Days of its receipt
of such Update, such Update shall be deemed to be an amendment to this

set forth in _Section 7.2_.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Restrictions on Transfer_. Prior to the Closing or the earlier
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article 8_, Seller shall not sell,

and expense, Seller shall take all actions reasonably requested by Buyer to
provide Buyer with all of Sellers rights under Article VI of the 2010 UPA

pursuing any indemnification claims thereunder. Seller shall not, until the
earlier of (x) the later of the expiration of the Drag- Along Period and the
Indemnification Period and (y) September 10, 2019, without Buyers written
consent, (i) exercise any of its rights under the 2010 UPA, including with
respect to the Drag-Along Rights and indemnification rights, (ii) adopt any

(b) by Buyer, if any of the representations or warranties of Seller or the

correct or if the Company or Seller has failed to perform any covenant or
agreement on the part of Seller or the Company set forth in this Agreement
(including an obligation to consummate the Closing) such that the condition to

be satisfied and the breach or breaches causing such representations or
warranties not to be true and correct, or the failures to perform any covenant
or agreement, as applicable, are not cured within twenty (20) calendar days
after written notice thereof is delivered to Seller; _provided_ that Buyer is
not then in breach of this Agreement so as to cause the condition to Closing
set forth in either _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ from being
satisfied;

 



      
 

 



 

(c) by Seller, if any of the representations or warranties of Buyer set forth

perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement (including an obligation to consummate the Closing) such that the
condition to Closing set forth in either _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section

(d) by either Buyer or Seller, if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not have been consummated on or prior to November 13, 2014
(the " _Termination Date_ ") and the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)_ shall not have breached in any material
respect its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have
proximately caused the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on or before the Termination Date; or

 



 

(e) by either Buyer or Seller, if any Governmental Entity shall have issued an
Order or taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such

Buyer, Seller, Seller Guarantor or the Company or their respective officers,
directors or equityholders) with the exception of (a) the provisions of this
_Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_, _Section 8.4_, _Section 6.5_ and _Article

under this Agreement prior to such termination (including any failure by a
Party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement if it is
obligated to do so hereunder). For purposes of this _Section 8.2_, "willful"

breaching Party with the knowledge that the taking of such act would, or would
be reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement.

written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of Buyer,
Seller and the Company. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except
as provided in the immediately preceding sentence and any purported amendment

Seller with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of any Party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement.

 



 

(h) For purposes of this _Article 9_, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty, and any damages resulting therefrom, shall be
determined without regard to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other
similar qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such
representation or warranty.

 



 

(i) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 9.4(i)_ the amount of any and
all Losses shall be determined net of (i) any amounts in payment for Losses
actually received by any of the Buyer Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as
applicable, (net of any related costs and expenses incurred in connection
therewith, including the direct costs of premiums relating to any such
insurance proceeds) under or pursuant to (x) any insurance coverage or storage
tank fund, including the Virginia Petroleum Storage Tank Fund, the 2010 UPA,
and all arrangements set forth on _Schedule 3.10_ and (y) any other indemnity
or reimbursement arrangement or Contract, or from other collateral sources,

Arrangements_ "), and (ii) any Tax benefits arising from the incurrence or

Arrangements and Seller shall provide reasonable cooperation to the Buyer
Indemnitees undertaking such efforts, including by providing reasonable access
to any documents, reports, data or other information in the possession of
Seller required by the Buyer Indemnitees or any Alternative Arrangements;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, (A) in no event, shall the expenditure of such
efforts require the Buyer Indemnitees to expend any such efforts prior to
submitting a claim for indemnification under this Agreement, (B) nothing
provided herein shall require any Buyer Indemnitee to avail itself of any
available policies of self-insurance other than any Alternative Arrangements,
and (C) if Buyer seeks indemnification from Seller, Buyer shall provide Seller
with documents and information directly related to such efforts and recovery,
as reasonably requested by Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall
not be liable for any Losses related to any breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 3.10_ ( _Environmental Matters_ ) unless and
until the Buyer Indemnitees have exhausted their remedies under all
Alternative Arrangements reasonably available to Buyer or any other Buyer
Indemnitees, and thereafter, Seller shall only be responsible for the portion
of any Losses that is not satisfied or covered by any reasonably available
Alternative Arrangements (net of any related costs and expenses incurred in
connection therewith, including the direct costs of premiums relating to any
insurance proceeds) after satisfaction or payment of any deductible or
retention thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in no event, shall the
exhaustion of such remedies require the Buyer Indemnitees to exhaust any such
remedies prior to submitting a claim for indemnification under this Agreement.
For purposes hereof, Buyer shall have satisfied the "exhaustion of remedies"
of Alternative Arrangements as long as Buyer has commenced a Proceeding in
pursuit of the Alternative Arrangements and Buyer prosecutes such Proceeding
in good faith in an attempt to avail itself of the Alternative Arrangements;
provided, however, that "exhaustion of remedies" shall not require Buyer to
pursue or appeal any decision issued in connection with any Proceeding.

 



 

(j) In any case where a Buyer Indemnitee recovers, under any Alternative
Arrangements, any amount in respect of a matter for which such Buyer
Indemnitee was, prior to such recovery, indemnified pursuant to _Section
9.2_, such Buyer Indemnitee shall promptly pay over to Seller any amount so
recovered from Seller (after deducting therefrom the amount of the expenses
incurred by such Buyer Indemnitee in procuring such recovery), but not in
excess of the _sum of_ (i) any amount previously so paid by Seller to or on
behalf of such Buyer Indemnitee in respect of such matter and (ii) any amount
actually expended by Seller in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of
such matter that is indemnifiable as a Loss hereunder.

 



 

(k) (i) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.2_ for any Loss to the extent that such Loss is
reflected as a liability on the Latest Company Balance Sheet or reflected in
the footnotes to the Company Financial Statements and (ii) the Seller
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section
9.3_ for any Loss to the extent that such Loss is reflected as a liability on
the Latest Buyer Balance Sheet or reflected in the financial statements of
Buyer included in the Buyer SEC Documents, in each case of clauses (i) and
(ii), only to the extent that amounts associated with such Loss are included
therein.

 



 

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller shall not be
obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for any Loss with respect to any
environmental

 



      
 

 



 

matter or condition, including for any inaccuracy or breach of the
representations and warranties in _Section 3.10_ ( _Environmental Matters_ ),
that is discovered or detected by any sampling, investigation, analysis or
reporting unless: (i) such sampling, investigating, analysis or reporting is
affirmatively required by Environmental Laws or by a Governmental Entity; (ii)
such sampling, investigation, analysis or reporting is necessary to conduct in
defense of a Third Party Claim (as defined below) against Buyer Indemnitees
alleging that Hazardous Substances have migrated off of any Owned Real
Property or Leased Real Property; or (iii) such sampling, investigation,
analysis or reporting is conducted in connection with the bona fide
construction or expansion of improvements by any Buyer Indemnitee at any Real
Property undertaken in the ordinary course of business, and in such case only
to the extent such sampling, investigation, analysis or reporting is
consistent with industry practice. Any indemnification of any of the Buyer
Indemnitees with respect to any remediation, removal or cleanup, including any
investigation, monitoring, or remedial obligations, shall be limited to such
cost effective action that is required by Environmental Laws or by a
Governmental Entity to attain compliance with minimum applicable remedial
standards for continued use of the relevant property or facility as a gasoline
fueling and service station and/or convenience store with gasoline fueling
operations, employing, if appropriate, available or acceptable, permissible
risk-based remedial standards and reasonable deed or use restrictions and
institutional controls.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Indemnification Procedures_. The party making a claim under this
_Article 9_ is referred to as the " _Indemnified Party_ ", and the party
against whom such claim is asserted under this _Article 9_ is referred to as
the " _Indemnifying Party_ ".

 



 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Proceeding made or brought by any Person who
is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement
or a representative of the foregoing (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to
provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give
the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any
event not later than thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of such notice of
such Third Party Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall
not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually and materially prejudiced thereby. Such notice by the Indemnified
Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall include
copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may
reasonably be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to participate in, or by giving written notice to the
Indemnified Party, to assume the conduct and control of the settlement or
defense of any Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense and by
the Indemnifying Partys own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate in good faith in such defense; _provided_ , that if the Indemnifying
Party is Seller, such Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or
direct the defense of any such Third Party Claim that seeks an injunction or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to
_Section 9.5(b)_, it shall have the right to take such action as it deems
necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining
to any such Third Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the
defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the
Indemnifying

 



      
 

 



 

Partys right to control the settlement and defense thereof. The fees and
disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified
Party; _provided_ , that if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses available to an Indemnified
Party that are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of one
counsel to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may,
subject to _Section 9.5(b)_, pay, compromise or defend such Third Party Claim
and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or
relating to such Third Party Claim. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each
other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third
Party Claim, including making available records relating to such Third Party
Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-
of-pocket expenses) to the defending party, such management employees of the
non-defending party, information and testimony, and attending such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be
reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party
Claim.

 



 

(b) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
except to the extent such settlement does not provide for liability or the
creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified
Party and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each
Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such
Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant
to _Section 9.5(a)_, it shall not agree to any settlement without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), and no such settlement shall be determinative of the
Indemnifying Partys obligations under this _Article 9_.

 



 

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30)
calendar days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to such Direct Claim. The failure to give
such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party
of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. Such notice
by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail,
shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount of the Loss that has been or may be reasonably
sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what
extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim, and the
Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including access to the Companys
premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts,
documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional
advisors may reasonably request.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 9.6 _Subrogation_. In the event of payment by or on behalf of any
Indemnifying Party to any Indemnified Party (including pursuant to this
_Article 9_) in connection with any Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnified
Party as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnified
Party may have any right, defense or claim relating to such claim or demand
against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such claim or demand. Such
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable
manner, and at the cost of such Indemnifying Party, in presenting any
subrogated right, defense or claim.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, and to the extent possible,
first as an adjustment to the Cash Consideration, unless otherwise required by
Law.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Exclusive Remedies_. Except with respect to _Section 8.2_, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing, their sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims (other than claims for
fraud on the part of a party in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, which such claims shall not be subject to any monetary or
survival limitations set forth herein, and other than claims to enforce, or
for breach of, Guaranteed Obligations pursuant to _Section 10.19_) for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth herein or otherwise relating to or in any way arising from the subject
matter of this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in this _Article 9_, and the Parties hereby waive any other
statutory and common law remedies or claims. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that each Buyer Indemnitees
right to indemnification under this _Article 9_ for any environmental matter,
including for any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties
contained in _Section 3.10_ ( _Environmental Matters_ ), shall constitute
such Buyer Indemnitees sole and exclusive remedy against Seller with respect
to any environmental matter, including any such matter arising under any
Environmental Laws. The Buyer Indemnitees hereby, except as specifically
reserved under this _Article 9_, (a) waive any remedies or claims that may be
available under Environmental Laws relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement, and (b) release Seller from any claim, demand or liability with
respect to any environmental matters relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement, including any such claims arising under Environmental Laws.

Section 10.3 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving

this Contribution Agreement together with the Schedules and exhibits hereto,
as the same may from time to time be amended, modified, supplemented or
restated in accordance with the terms hereof. The headings contained in this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. No Party, nor its respective
counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of this Agreement for purposes of
construing the provisions hereof, and all provisions of this Agreement shall
be construed according to their fair meaning and not strictly for or against
any Party. Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary herein by the context or
use thereof: (i) the words, "herein," "hereto," "hereof" and words of similar

this Agreement. Any item disclosed in any Schedule referenced by a particular
section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect
to every other section in this Agreement if the relevance of such disclosure
to such other section is reasonably apparent. The specification of any dollar
amount in the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or the
inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule is not intended to imply that
such amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items so included or other
items, are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting
of such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or
controversy as to whether any obligation, items or matter not described herein
or included in a Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.7 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each Party and its successors and permitted
assigns and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or

Section 10.8 _Representation by Counsel_. Each of the Parties agrees that it
has been represented by independent counsel of its choice during the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the documents referred to
herein, and that it has executed the same upon the advice of such independent
counsel. Each Party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation
of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts
relating thereto shall be deemed the work product of the Parties and may not
be construed against any Party by reason of its preparation. Therefore, the
Parties waive the application of any Law providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the Party drafting such
agreement or document.

 



 

Section 10.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all other provisions of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile or scanned pages shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.11 _Knowledge of the Company_. For all purposes of this Agreement,
the phrases "to the Companys knowledge" and "known by the Company" and any
derivations thereof shall mean, as of the applicable date, the actual
knowledge of the officers of the Group Companies at the time of the Closing
(none of whom shall have any personal liability or obligations regarding such
knowledge).

 



 

Section 10.12 _Limitation on Remedies_. Except in the case of fraud, no breach
of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein or in any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall give rise to any right
on the part of Buyer or Seller, after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 10.13 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or
implied in this Agreement, Buyer agrees and acknowledges that no recourse
under this Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in connection
with this Agreement shall be had against any current or future director,
officer, employee or member of Seller or of any Affiliate or assignee thereof,
as such, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other
applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal
liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred
by any current or future officer, agent or employee of Seller or any current
or future member of Seller or any current or future director, officer,
employee or member of Seller or of any Affiliate or assignee thereof, as such,
for any obligation of Seller under this Agreement or any documents or
instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement for any claim based
on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any right to trial by jury of any claim, demand,
action, or cause of action (i) arising under this Agreement or (ii) in any way
connected with or related or incidental to the dealings of the Parties in
respect of this Agreement or any of the transactions related hereto, in each
case, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether in contract,
tort, equity, or otherwise. Each Party hereby further agrees and consents that
any such claim, demand, action, or cause of action shall be decided by court
trial without a jury and that the Parties may file a copy of this Agreement
with any court as written evidence of the consent of the Parties to the waiver
of their right to trial by jury.

 



 

Section 10.15 _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Each of the Parties (i) submits to the
exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery for the State of
Delaware (the " _Chancery Court_ ") and any state appellate court therefrom
located within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Chancery Court declines
to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware) in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of such Proceeding may
be heard and determined in any such court and (iii) agrees not to bring any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court.
Each of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any Proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other Party with respect thereto. Each
Party agrees that service of summons and complaint or any other process that
might be served in any Proceeding may be made on such Party by sending or
delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the address of
the Party and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section
10.2_. Nothing in this _Section 10.15_, however, shall affect the right of
any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law. Each
Party agrees that a final, non-appealable judgment in any Proceeding so
brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in
any other manner provided by Law.

 



 

Section 10.16 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any
and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree and acknowledge that
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform their respective obligations under the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with
their specific terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly
agreed that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or undertaking, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.
Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other
Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.17 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

 



 

Section 10.18 _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, as and when
requested by any Party and at such Partys expense, any other Party shall
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents
and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or
other actions as such other Party may reasonably deem necessary to evidence
and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.19 _Seller Guarantor_.

 



 

(a) Seller Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to the Buyer the due, full and punctual payment and performance of
all covenants, obligations, liabilities and agreements of Seller hereunder
(the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "), subject to the terms and conditions
hereunder. If, for any reason whatsoever, Seller shall fail or be unable to
duly, punctually and fully pay or perform the Guaranteed Obligations, Seller
Guarantor will forthwith pay and cause to be paid in lawful currency of the
United States, or perform or cause to be performed, the Guaranteed
Obligations. The foregoing obligation of Seller Guarantor constitutes a
continuing guarantee of payment and performance, and is and shall be absolute
and unconditional under any and all circumstances, including circumstances
which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor
and including any amendment, extension, modification or waiver of any of the
Guaranteed Obligations or any insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or
dissolution of Seller or any assignment thereby. Seller Guarantor hereby
irrevocably waives (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law) notice
of acceptance of this guaranty and notice of any liability to which it may
apply, and waives promptness, diligence, presentment, demand or payment,
protest, notice of dishonor or nonpayment, suit, filing objections with a
court, any right to require proceeding first against Seller (including
initiating a Proceeding against Seller), any right to require the prior
disposition of the assets of Seller to meet any of its obligations hereunder
or the taking of any other action by Buyer and the Buyer Group and all demands
whatsoever. The guaranty set forth in this _Section 10.19(a)_ will remain in
full force and effect, and will be binding upon Seller Guarantor, until all of
the Guaranteed Obligations have been satisfied.

 



 

(b) Seller Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to Buyer that:

 



 

(i) Seller Guarantor is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization;

 



 

(ii) Seller Guarantor has all requisite limited partnership power and
authority and has taken all limited partnership action necessary in order to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) No material notices to, filings with, or authorizations, consents or
approvals of any Governmental Entity are necessary for the execution, delivery
or performance of this Agreement. Neither the execution, delivery and
performance by Seller Guarantor of this Agreement nor the consummation by
Seller Guarantor of the transactions contemplated thereby will (A) conflict
with or result in any breach of any provision of Seller Guarantors Governing

 



      
 

 



 

Documents, (B) result in a violation or breach of, or cause acceleration, or
constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration) under any
of the terms, conditions or provisions of any material Contract to which
Seller Guarantor is a party, other than violations, breaches, accelerations or
defaults which would not, or would not be reasonably likely to, have a
material effect on Sellers ability to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement or (C) violate any material Law or Order of
any Governmental Entity applicable to Seller Guarantor or any of its
properties or assets; and

 



 

(iv) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Seller Guarantor
and is a valid and binding agreement of Seller Guarantor, enforceable against
it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting generally the enforcement
of creditors rights and subject to general principles of equity.

 

       
 

 



 

 **IN WITNESS WHEREOF** , each of the Parties has caused this Contribution
Agreement to be duly executed on its behalf as of the day and year first above
written.
