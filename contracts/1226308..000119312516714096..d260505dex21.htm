Parent Effective Time, by virtue of the Parent Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Holdco, Parent Merger Sub or any holder of any
shares of Parent common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the " _Parent
Common Stock_ "):

 

(a) Subject to _Section 2.4_ and _Section 2.6_, each share of Parent Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Parent Effective Time
shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Holdco
Common Stock (the " _Parent Merger Consideration_ ").

 



4 (b) Each share of common stock of Parent Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Parent Effective Time shall be converted into one
share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Parent Surviving
Corporation.

 

(c) All of the shares of Parent Common Stock converted into shares of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Holdco (" _Holdco Common Stock_ ")
pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ shall cease to be outstanding and shall cease
to exist and, as of the Parent Effective Time, the holders of Parent Common
Stock shall be deemed to have received shares of Holdco Common Stock (without
the requirement for the surrender of any certificate previously representing
any such shares of Parent Common Stock or issuance of new certificates
representing Holdco Common Stock), with each certificate representing shares
of Parent Common Stock (a " _Parent Certificate_ ") prior to the Parent
Effective Time being deemed to represent automatically an equivalent number of
shares of Holdco Common Stock.

 

Section 2.2 _Effect on Capital Stock of the Company and Company Merger Sub_.
At the Company Effective Time, by virtue of the Company Merger and without
any further action on the part of Holdco, the Company, Company Merger Sub or
any holder of any shares of Company Common Stock, $0.0001 par value per share
(the " _Company Common Stock_ "):

 

(a) All shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding that are held by
Parent or Holdco, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or the Company as
treasury stock or that are owned by the Company, Company Merger Sub or any
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Company
Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be paid in exchange therefor.

(b) Subject to _Section 2.2(a)_, _Section 2.4_ and  _Section 2.10_, each
share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Company
Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and automatically converted into
the right to receive, for each such share of Company Common Stock, $42.50,
without any interest thereon (the " _Company Merger Consideration_ ").

(c) Each share of common stock of Company Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Company Effective Time shall be converted into one
share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company Surviving
Corporation.

 

(d) As of the Company Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock shall
cease to be outstanding and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company
Stock Certificate_ ") or shares of Company Common Stock held in book entry
form (" _Company Book Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive, subject to and in accordance
with the applicable provision(s) of _Section 2.8_, and in accordance with
_Section 2.2(b)_ and this _Section 2.2(d)_, the Company Merger
Consideration, without interest.

Section 2.3 _Effect on Holdco Capital Stock_. At the Parent Effective
Time, each share of Holdco Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Parent Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



5 Section 2.4 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Times, the outstanding shares of Holdco Common Stock, Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares
or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares, readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock
dividend or stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date
within said period, the Company Merger Consideration and any other similarly
dependent items, as the case may be, without duplication, shall be equitably
adjusted to provide the holders of Parent Common Stock and Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event.

Section 2.5 _Company Equity Awards_.

(a) _Company Options_.

 

(i) If the exercise price per share of any Vested Company Option is less than
the Company Merger Consideration, then such Vested Company Option shall, as
of the Company Effective Time, be canceled, with each former holder of any
such canceled Vested Company Option becoming entitled to receive, at the next
practicable regularly scheduled payroll date after the Company Effective
Time, in consideration of the cancellation of such Vested Company Option, an
amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for any required
withholding Tax as contemplated in _Section 2.9_), equal to the product
of: (A) the excess, if any, of the Company Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of each such Vested Company Option; and (B) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Vested Company
Option.

 

(ii) Each Unvested Company Option with an exercise price that is equal to or
greater than the Company Merger Consideration, each Vested Company Option
with an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Company Merger
Consideration (each of the foregoing, an " _Out-of-the-Money Company Option_
") and each Unvested Company Option with an exercise price that is less than
the Company Merger Consideration (each, an " _In-the-Money Unvested Company
Option_ ") shall, as of the Company Effective Time, automatically and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Holdco and
converted into a Holdco Option to purchase (i) that number of shares of Holdco
Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (A) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Out-of-the-Money Company Option or In-the-Money Unvested
Company Option, as applicable, immediately prior to the Company Effective Time
by (B) the Exchange Ratio, (ii) at a per-share exercise price (rounded up to
the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Out-of-the-
Money Company Option or In-the-Money Unvested Company Option, as applicable,
was exercisable immediately prior to the Company Effective Time by (B) the
Exchange Ratio. Each such Holdco Option shall continue to have, and shall be
subject to, the same terms and conditions (including continued service-based
vesting conditions) as applied to the corresponding Out-of-the-Money Company
Option or In-the-Money Unvested Company Option, as applicable, immediately
prior to the Company Effective Time.

 



6 (b) _Company RSUs_.

 

(i) Each Vested Company RSU shall be canceled at the Company Effective Time,
and in exchange therefor, the Company Surviving Corporation shall pay to each
former holder of any such Vested Company RSU, at the next practicable
regularly scheduled payroll date after the Company Effective Time, an amount
in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for any
required withholding Tax as contemplated in _Section 2.9_), equal to the
product of: (A) the Company Merger Consideration and (B) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock underlying such Vested Company RSU; _provided_
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
any payment in respect of any Vested Company RSU which immediately prior to

Company RSU if required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(ii) Each Unvested Company RSU shall, as of the Company Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
assumed by Holdco and converted into a Holdco RSU with respect to a number of
shares of Holdco Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (i) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company RSU immediately prior to the
Company Effective Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio. Each such Holdco RSU shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and
conditions (including continued service-based vesting conditions) as applied
to the corresponding Unvested Company RSU immediately prior to the Company
Effective Time.

 

(c) _Company PRSUs_. Each Company PRSU, whether vested or unvested (treating
for this purpose any performance-based vesting condition to which such
Company PRSU is as of the Effective Time or was as of the Agreement Date
subject as having been attained at the "target level"), that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Company Effective Time shall, as of the
Company Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, become fully vested and canceled, and in exchange
therefor, the Company Surviving Corporation shall pay to each former holder of
any such Company PRSU, at the Company Effective Time or as soon as
practicable thereafter (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
thereafter), an amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for
any required withholding Tax as contemplated in  _Section 2.9_), equal to
the product of: (A) the Company Merger Consideration and (B) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company PRSU; _provided_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
payment in respect of any Company PRSU which immediately prior to such
cancellation was treated as "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of
the Code shall be made on the applicable settlement date for such Company
PRSU if required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

 



7 (d) _Company ESPPs_. Following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board
(or, if applicable, any committee thereof administering each Company ESPP)
shall adopt such resolutions or take such other necessary actions such that
(i) with respect to any outstanding Offering Period(s) (as such term is
defined in the applicable Company ESPP) under a Company ESPP, the Offering
Period(s) under such Company ESPP shall terminate and a Purchase Date (as such
term is defined in the applicable Company ESPP) shall occur under such Company
ESPP upon the earlier to occur of (x) the day that is four (4) trading days
prior to the Company Effective Time or (y) the date on which such Offering
Period(s) would otherwise end, and no additional offering periods shall
commence under such Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement; (iii) no
individual participating in a Company ESPP shall be permitted to (A) increase

required by applicable Law, make separate non-payroll contributions to a
Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement; (iv) no individual
who is not participating in a Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement
may commence participation in a Company ESPP following the date of this
Agreement; and (v) subject to the consummation of the Merger, each Company

Time.

 

(e) _Further Actions_. Prior to the Company Effective Time, the Company Board
(or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering any Company Stock
Plan or the Company ESPPs) shall take such actions as are necessary to approve
and effectuate the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.5_, including
making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a
committee thereof or any administrator of a Company Stock Plan or Company ESPP
as may be necessary and delivering any required notices. The Company shall
provide Parent with documentation evidencing the completion of the foregoing
actions (the form and substance of such documentation shall be subject to
review and approval by Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) not later than the Business Day preceding the Company
Effective Time.

 

Section 2.6 _Parent Equity Awards_.

 

(a) As of the Parent Effective Time, (i) each Parent Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Parent Effective Time, whether or not
then vested or exercisable, shall, without any action on the part of the

a Holdco Option on substantially the same terms and conditions (including the
vesting schedule, exercisability conditions and per share exercise price) as
applied to such Parent Option immediately prior to the Parent Effective Time;
(ii) each share of Parent Restricted Stock that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Parent Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of

Parent RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Parent Effective Time,
whether or not then vested, shall, without any action on the part of the

vesting and settlement schedule) as applied to such Parent RSU
immediately prior to the Parent Effective Time; and (iv) the Parent Stock
Plans, including all of the rights, powers, obligations, responsibilities and
obligations set forth therein, shall be assumed by Holdco.

the treatment of such awards in accordance with this _Section 2.6_.

 

(c) As of the Parent Effective Time, any right to purchase shares of Parent

Section 2.7 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Company
Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Company Effective Time (including any Dissenting
Shares) shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and all holders of Company Stock Certificates and Company Book Entry Shares,
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Company Effective Time shall,
in each case, cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b)
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to
all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Company Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company
Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Company
Effective Time. If, after the Company Effective Time, a Company Stock
Certificate previously representing any shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Company Effective Time is presented to
the Payment Agent or to the Company Surviving Corporation or Holdco, such
Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided
in _Section 2.8_ or, in the case of Dissenting Shares, treated as set forth
in _Section 2.10_.

 

Section 2.8 _Surrender of Company Stock Certificates_.

 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or
trust company to act as payment agent in the Company Merger (the " _Payment
Agent_ "). At the Company Effective Time or as promptly as practicable
thereafter (but in no event later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
Business Day following the Company Effective Time), Parent shall deposit
with the Payment Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Company Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.2_. The cash amount so deposited
with the Payment Agent is referred to as the " _Payment Fund_." The
Payment Agent will invest the funds included in the Payment Fund in the
manner directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments
shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or
any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or
P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that
are then publicly available). Any interest or other income resulting from the
investment of such funds shall be the property of Parent.



 



9 (b) Within five (5) Business Days after the Company Effective Time, the
Payment Agent will mail to the Persons who were record holders of Company
Stock Certificates or Company Book Entry Shares immediately prior to the
Company Effective Time (other than to holders of Dissenting Shares to the
extent such holders do not also hold shares of Company Common Stock that are
not Dissenting Shares): (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
reasonably acceptable to the Company that shall specify that delivery of such
Company Stock Certificates or transfer of such Company Book Entry Shares
shall be deemed to have occurred, and risk of loss and title to the Company
Stock Certificates or Company Book Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Company Stock Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of the Company Book Entry Shares to the
Payment Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Company Stock Certificates or transfer of the Company Book Entry Shares in
exchange for the Company Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company
Stock Certificate to the Payment Agent for exchange, together with a duly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal or receipt of an "agents
message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer to
the Payment Agent as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of
Company Book Entry Shares, together with a duly completed and validly executed
letter of transmittal or, in each case, such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Payment Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such
Company Stock Certificate or Company Book Entry Share shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, subject to any required withholding of Taxes,
the Company Merger Consideration; and (B) the Company Stock Certificate or
Company Book Entry Share so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.8(b)_, each Company Stock Certificate
or Company Book Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the Company
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Company Merger
Consideration as contemplated by _Section 2.2_. No interest shall be paid or
accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of any Company
Stock Certificate or Company Book Entry Share. If any Company Merger
Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the stockholder in whose
name the Company Book Entry Share transferred or Company Stock Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of
such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Payment Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of payment
of the Company Merger Consideration to a Person other than the stockholder
owning the Company Book Entry Share transferred or Company Stock Certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Payment
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. If any Company Stock
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent or the Payment
Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of
any Company Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide
an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond in such reasonable amount as
the Company Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against the Payment Agent, Parent or the Company Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate. Upon the
making of such affidavit and delivering such bond, the Payment Agent will
issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock
Certificate, the Company Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Company Stock
Certificate as contemplated under this _Article II_.

 



10 (c) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed or undistributed to
holders of Company Stock Certificates or Company Book Entry Shares as of the
date that is one (1) year after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Holdco
upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates (other than with
respect to any Dissenting Shares) who have not theretofore surrendered their
Company Stock Certificates or Company Book Entry Shares in accordance with
this _Section 2.8_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Holdco
for satisfaction of their claims for the Company Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _Section 2.8_. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of
shares of Company Common Stock two (2) years after the Closing Date (or such
earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body) shall become, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Holdco free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of Holdco, the Company
Surviving Corporation or the Parent Surviving Corporation shall be liable to
any holder of any Company Stock Certificate or to any other Person with
respect to any Company Merger Consideration delivered to any public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property Law, escheat Law or similar Law.

 

Section 2.9 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Holdco, Parent, Parent Merger Sub,
the Company, Company Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporations and the Payment
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Company Merger
Consideration or any other payments made in connection with this Agreement, as
applicable, payable to any holder of any shares of Parent Common Stock, any
holder of any shares of Company Common Stock, any holder of any Parent Equity
Award, any holder of any Company Equity Award or any other recipient pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
from such consideration under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law or under any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts
are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid.

Section 2.10 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has properly made a
demand for appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(any such shares being referred to as " _Dissenting Shares_ ") until such time
as such holder effectively withdraws or fails to perfect or otherwise loses
such holders appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to
such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the
Company Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.2_, but shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of
Dissenting Shares. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL.

 



11 (b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Company Effective Time
or the date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be
converted into and shall represent only the right to receive the Company
Merger Consideration in accordance with  _Section 2.2_, without interest
thereon, upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificate representing such
shares or transfer of such Company Book Entry Shares, as the case may be, in
accordance with _Section 2.8_.

 

(c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt written notice of (A) any demand
for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Company Effective Time
pursuant to the DGCL; (B) any withdrawal or attempted withdrawal of any such
demand; and (C) any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Company Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL; and (ii) to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the opportunity to participate and
right to control any and all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demand, notice or instrument; _provided_ that the Company shall
be permitted to participate in such negotiations and proceedings. Neither the
Company nor Parent shall, without the prior written consent of the other
party, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer to
settle, any such demands or applications, or waive any failure to timely
deliver a written demand for appraisal or agree to do any of the foregoing.
Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled under Section 262 of the
DGCL to receive payment of the "fair value" for such holders shares shall
receive such payment therefor from the Company Surviving Corporation after
giving effect to any withholdings or deductions required by applicable Law
(but only after the amount thereof shall have been finally determined
pursuant to the DGCL).

Section 2.11 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Times, any
further action is determined by Holdco or Parent to be necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest (i) the Company
Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all
rights and property of Company Merger Sub and the Company or (ii) the Parent
Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all
rights and property of Parent Merger Sub and Parent, the officers and
directors of the Company Surviving Corporation, the Parent Surviving
Corporation, Parent and Holdco shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Company Merger Sub, Parent Merger Sub, the Company, Parent and otherwise) to
take and shall take such action.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 

Except as set forth in (i) the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents (including exhibits and all information incorporated by reference)
filed by the Company with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _SEC_ ") since December 31, 2013 and prior to the date of this
Agreement (but without giving effect to any amendment to any such document
filed on or after the date hereof), other than any information that is
predictive or forward looking in nature or information contained under the

(i) shall not be applicable to _Section 3.2_) or (ii) the Company Disclosure
Letter (each section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered
representation and warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein,
_provided_ that any disclosure set forth with respect to any particular
section shall be deemed to be disclosed in reference to all other applicable
sections of this Agreement if the disclosure in respect of the particular
section is sufficient on its face without further inquiry reasonably to inform
Parent of the information required to be disclosed in respect of such other
sections) delivered by the Company to the Parent Parties on the date hereof
(the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to the Parent Parties as follows:

 

Section 3.1 _Organization_.

Subsidiaries_ ") is a corporation, limited liability company or limited
partnership duly organized, validly existing and, where applicable, in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. Each of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified and/or licensed to
do business as a foreign corporation, limited liability company or limited
partnership, and, where applicable, is in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the leasing of
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to be material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(b) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has all requisite power
and authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits,
authorizations and approvals (collectively, the " _Permits_ ") and has made
all filings required under applicable Law necessary to enable it to own,
operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now
conducted, except for such Permits or filings, the lack of which, would not
reasonably be expected to be material, individually or in the aggregate, to
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Since January
1, 2014, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has received
any written notice of any violation of or failure to comply with any Permit or
any actual or possible revocation, withdrawal, suspension, cancellation,
termination or material modification of any Permit, and each such Permit has
been validly issued or obtained and is in full force and effect.

(c) The copies of the composite certificate of incorporation and amended and
restated bylaws of the Company which are incorporated by reference as exhibits
to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2012 and the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on

bylaws or like organizational documents, each as amended to the Agreement
Date.

 



13 (d) The Company has made available to Parent the minutes of the meetings and
other proceedings (including any actions taken by written consent or
otherwise without a meeting) of the stockholders and board of directors (or to
the extent applicable, any committee thereof) of the Company, since December
31, 2013 through the date hereof. The minutes of the meetings and other
proceedings (including any actions taken by written consent or otherwise
without a meeting) of the board of directors (or to the extent applicable, any
committee thereof) of the Company made available to Parent were complete and
redacted only with respect to discussions of the transaction contemplated
hereby or other similar strategic transactions, and not with respect to other
matters.

 

(e) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in violation of any of
the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or equivalent
constituent documents), including all amendments thereto, of such entity.

Section 3.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 70,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
par value $0.0001 per share, (" _Company Preferred Stock_ "). As of the close

17,747,932 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding; (B) no
shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding; (C) 4,667,061
shares of Company Common Stock were held by the Company in its treasury; (D)

Company Common Stock, whether or not presently exerciseable; (E) 918,940
shares of Company Common Stock were subject to issuance pursuant to
outstanding Company RSUs; (F) 235,262 shares of Company Common Stock were

the Company ESPPs; and (H) 3,237,830 shares of Company Common Stock were

Common Stock have been, and all shares that may be issued pursuant to any
Company Stock Plan or as contemplated or permitted by this Agreement will be,
when issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof, duly authorized
and validly issued, or in the case of shares that have not yet been issued,
will be, fully paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. The
Company has made available to Parent or its counsel accurate and complete
copies of the Company Stock Plans and Company ESPPs and the forms of stock
option and restricted stock unit agreements and corresponding grant notices
evidencing the Company Equity Awards and, other than differences with respect
to the number of shares covered thereby, the grant date, the exercise price,
regular vesting schedule and expiration date applicable thereto, no stock
option agreement or restricted stock unit agreement or corresponding grant
notice contains material terms that are in addition to, or inconsistent with,
such forms. _Section 3.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as
of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, each outstanding
Company Equity Award and to the extent applicable, the name of the holder
thereof, the country of residence of the holder thereof, the number of shares
of Company Common Stock issuable thereunder (including target and maximum
numbers for Company Equity Awards subject to performance based vesting), the
expiration date, the exercise or conversion price relating thereto, the grant
date, the vesting schedule, whether or not it is subject to performance based
vesting, the amount vested and outstanding, the amount unvested and
outstanding, and the Company Stock Plan pursuant to which the award was made.
The Company Stock Plans are the only plans or programs the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries has maintained under which stock options, restricted
shares, restricted share units, performance shares or other compensatory
equity or equity-based awards have been granted and remain outstanding or may
be granted. Each grant of Company Equity Awards was made in accordance with
the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan, the NASDAQ Listing Rules and
all applicable Laws. Since the Capitalization Date, the Company has not
authorized the creation or issuance of, or issued, or authorized or effected
any split-up or any other recapitalization of, any of its capital stock, or
directly or indirectly redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired any of its
outstanding capital stock. The Company has not heretofore agreed to take any
such action, and there are no outstanding contractual obligations of the
Company of any kind to redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company. Other than the Company Common Stock,
there are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness or
securities of the Company having the right to vote (or, other than the
outstanding Company Equity Awards or rights under the Company ESPPs,
convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on
any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any voting agreement with
respect to any Company securities or securities of any wholly owned Company
Subsidiary.

 



14 (b) Except as set forth in _Section 3.2(a)_, (i) as of Capitalization Date,
no shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company are
issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding, and (ii) there are no
outstanding securities, options, equity or equity-based compensation,
warrants, calls, rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or
undertakings of any kind to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound obligating the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or
cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of the Company or of any of the Company Subsidiaries
or obligating the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to issue, grant,
extend or enter into any such security, option, equity or equity-based
compensation, warrant, call, right, commitment, agreement, arrangement or
undertaking.

(a) The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
and deliver this Agreement and all other agreements and
documents contemplated hereby to which it is a party, to carry out its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions

proceedings on the part of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries are
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and the consummation
by the Company of the Transactions. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its obligations
hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been
duly authorized by the Company Board. This Agreement has been duly

insolvency or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally and equitable principles of general applicability.

necessary to authorize the consummation of the Transactions.

(c) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by the
Company nor the consummation by the Company of the Transactions nor compliance
by the Company with any of the provisions herein will (i) result in a
violation or breach of or conflict with the certificate or articles
of incorporation or bylaws or other similar organizational documents of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (ii) require any consent by any
Person under, contravene or conflict with or result in a violation or breach

or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination or
cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under, or accelerate the
performance required by the Company under, or result in a right of
termination or acceleration under, or result in the creation of any Lien

operated by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to the
terms, conditions or provisions of, any Company Material Contract to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or (iii) subject to obtaining or
making the consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations and filings referred to in paragraph (d) below, violate any
judgment, ruling, order, writ, injunction or decree (" _Judgment_ ") or any
Law applicable to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of

39 Section 4.9 _Financing_.

 

(a) The obligations of the Parent Parties hereunder are not subject to a
condition regarding the Parent Parties obtaining of funds to consummate the
Mergers and the Transactions. Parent has delivered to the Company true,
correct and complete copies of the executed commitment letter, dated as of the
date hereof, from Royal Bank of Canada (together with all exhibits,
annexes, schedules and attachments thereto, and including the Redacted Fee
Letter, and each as may be amended, modified or replaced in accordance with
_Section 5.13_, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which, and
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the lenders party thereto have
committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Parent for the purpose of
funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Debt
Financing_ ").

 

(b) As of the date hereof, (i) the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and
effect and has not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect or
otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect, and (ii) to the
Knowledge of Parent, no such withdrawal, termination, rescission, amendment,
supplement or modification is presently contemplated (except for
any amendment or modification to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities and that would not
reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing or Parents ability to
consummate the Debt Financing). As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment
Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar Laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally, whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. As of the date hereof, except
for the Debt Commitment Letter, there are no side letters or other
agreements, contracts or arrangements relating to the Debt Financing,
including any that could affect the availability of the Debt Financing, to
which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party other than as expressly set
forth or referenced in the Debt Commitment Letter and non-disclosure
agreements that do not impact the conditionality for the Debt Financing to
occur or amount of the Debt Financing. As of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would (x)
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any of the other parties thereto, under the Debt Commitment Letter,
(y) result in a failure of any condition of the Debt Commitment Letter by
Parent, or (z) to the Knowledge of Parent, result in any portion of the Debt
Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. Parent has fully paid any
and all commitment fees or other fees or deposits required by the
Debt Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date hereof. Assuming the
Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter and
satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the
Mergers, the aggregate net proceeds of the Debt Financing together with
available cash of Parent will be sufficient for the satisfaction of all of
Parents obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the
aggregate Company Merger Consideration and all amounts to be paid pursuant to
_Section 2.2_, the payment of all associated costs and expenses of the
Mergers (including any repayment or refinancing of Indebtedness of the Company
required in connection therewith). As of the date hereof, there are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding or
investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than
as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.

 

(c) Parent is not a party to any Contract which directly or indirectly limits
or restricts the ability of any Person to provide debt financing for other
potential purchasers of the Company.

 



40 Section 4.10 _Solvency_. Parent is not entering into this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the
Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries. Immediately after the Closing and
after giving effect to the Transactions and the Debt Financing, excluding the
effect of any inaccuracy of the Companys representations and warranties
contained in _Article III_ , Holdco and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
will be Solvent. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ "
shall mean that, as of any date of determination and with respect to any
Person: (a) the fair value of the property of such Person is greater than the
total amount of liabilities, including, contingent liabilities, of such
Person, (b) the present fair salable value of the assets of such Person is
not less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability
of such Person on its debts as they become absolute and matured, (c) such
Person has not incurred, and does not intend to incur, debts or liabilities
beyond such Persons ability to pay such debts and liabilities as they mature
and (d) such Person is not engaged in business or a transaction, and is not
about to engage in business or a transaction, for which such Persons
property would constitute an unreasonably small capital. The amount of
contingent liabilities at any time shall be computed under this _Section
4.10_ as the amount that, in the light of all the facts and
circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that is probable
to become an actual or matured liability.

Section 4.11 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. None of the Parent Parties
or any of their respective controlled Affiliates beneficially owns (as such
term is used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) or owns (as
such term is used in Section 203 of the DGCL) any Company Common Stock or any
options, warrants or other rights to acquire Company Common Stock or other
securities of, or any other economic interest (through derivatives, securities
or otherwise) in the Company.

 

Section 4.12 _No Vote Required_. No vote or consent of the holders of any
class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this
Agreement, the Mergers or any of the Transactions. The votes or consents of
Holdco (that will be obtained prior to the Closing) as the sole stockholder of
(i) Company Merger Sub and (ii) Parent Merger Sub are the only votes
or consents of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the
Merger Subs necessary to approve this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the
Transactions.

obligations with respect to confidentiality; (B) result in a violation of
applicable Law; or (C) result in loss of legal protection, including the
attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine. Without limiting the
foregoing, in the event that the Company does not provide access or

the Company Board has not then made a Change in Company Board Recommendation,
the Company shall, through the Company Board, (i) make the Company Board
Recommendation, (ii) include such Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement, and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to (A) solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Mergers, and (B) take all other action necessary
or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (x) if on the date the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled,
the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company shall have the right to make one or more postponements
or adjournments of the Company Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ that Company
Stockholder Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than
thirty (30) days after the date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting
was, at the time of such postponement or adjournment, scheduled to be held or
reconvened, as applicable. Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms, the obligations of the parties under this _Section 5.3_
shall continue in full force and effect and this Agreement shall be submitted
to the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder Meeting for the
purpose of voting on adopting this Agreement. 

 



47 Section 5.4 _No Solicitation by the Company; Other Offers_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, until the earlier of the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and the date on which
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_, the Company shall
not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, and it shall not
authorize or permit its and their respective Representatives to, directly or
indirectly through another Person, solicit, initiate or knowingly take any
action to facilitate or encourage any Acquisition Proposal or proposal or
inquiry that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, or, subject to  _Section 5.4(b)_, (i) conduct or
engage in any discussions or negotiations with, disclose any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to,
afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to or otherwise cooperate in any
way with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any
effort by, any third party that is seeking to make, or has made,
any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) (A) amend or grant any waiver or release under
any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (other than
provisions in such obligations customarily referred to as "dont ask"
provisions) or (B) approve any transaction under, or any third party becoming
an "interested stockholder" under, Section 203 of Delaware Law, (iii) enter
into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other Contract relating to any Acquisition Proposal
or enter into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring the Company
to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or breach its obligations under this Agreement, or (iv) resolve,
propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing,
it is understood that any act or omission by any Company Subsidiary or
Representatives of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that would
have constituted a breach of this _Section 5.4_ if committed or omitted by
the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.4(a)_ by the
Company. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its
and their respective Representatives to immediately cease and cause to
be terminated, and shall not authorize or knowingly permit any of its or
their Representatives to continue, any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, with any third party conducted with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal and shall request and, if necessary, enforce any
rights to require any such third party (or its agents or advisors) in
possession of non-public information in respect of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries to return or destroy (and confirm destruction of) all
such information.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.4_ to the contrary, at any
time prior to the Effective Times, in response to an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement, and not
resulting from a breach of  _Section 5.4(a)_, that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside counsel) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal, the Company may, upon a good faith determination by the
Company Board (after consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the
Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law: (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and such Persons Representatives and
financing sources); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and such Person
enter into a customary confidentiality agreement containing provisions (but
that need not contain "standstill" or similar restrictions) and such other
terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement and containing additional provisions that
expressly permit the Company to comply with the terms of this _Section 5.4_;
_provided_ , _further_ , that any material non-public information concerning
the Company or any Company Subsidiary provided or made available to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal shall, to the extent not previously
provided to Parent, be provided or made available to Parent as promptly as
reasonably practicable after it is provided to such Person making such
Acquisition Proposal; and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives)
regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

 



48 (c) The Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing, in no event later
than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and
shall indicate the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal,
the terms and conditions of any proposal or offer, the nature of any inquiries
or contacts, and all written materials relating to such Acquisition Proposal
and thereafter shall keep Parent informed of all developments affecting the
status and the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal.

 

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) fail to
make, withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,
amend or modify the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, endorse, adopt
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal, (iii) fail to recommend against
acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for Company Common Stock
within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such offer, (iv) take
any action to exempt or make any Person (other than the Parent Parties) not
subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL or any other potentially
applicable anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation or (v) resolve or
agree to take any of the foregoing actions (each such foregoing action or
failure to act in clauses (i) through (v) being referred to as a " _Change in
Company Board Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
determination (but not the adoption, approval, recommendation or endorsement)
by the Company Board that an Acquisition Proposal is or would be reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal shall not be deemed a "Change in Company
Board Recommendation," and the Company Board may, at any time prior to the
Effective Times, take any of the actions set forth in _Section 5.4(d)(i)_ and
_Section 5.4(d)(ii)_ below ( _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to taking
any such action, the Company complies with  _Section 5.4(e)_ of this
Agreement):

(i) if there is an Intervening Event, effect a Change in Company
Board Recommendation if the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; and

(ii) effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation in response to an
Acquisition Proposal if (A) the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and (B) the Company Board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys financial advisor and outside
counsel, that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

 



49 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.4(d)_,
the Company shall not be entitled to make a Change in Company Board
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.4(d)(i)_ or _Section 5.4(d)(ii)_
unless: (A) the Company shall have first provided prompt prior written notice,
and in any event at least four (4) Business Days prior to making a Change in
Company Board Recommendation (the " _Notice Period_ ") to Parent of its
intention to make a Change in Company Board Recommendation (a "
_Recommendation Change Notice_ "), which notice shall, if the basis for the
proposed action by the Company Board is not related to a Superior Proposal,
contain a description of the Intervening Event giving rise to such proposed
action or, if the basis for the proposed action by the Company Board is a
Superior Proposal, contain a description of the material terms and conditions
of such Superior Proposal, including the most current version of the agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal (which description and summary shall
be updated on a prompt basis) in the form to be entered into and the identity
of the third party making the Superior Proposal (a " _Superior Proposal
Notice_ ") (it being understood and agreed that the delivery of such notice
shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a Change in Company Board
Recommendation); (B) the Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisor
and legal counsel to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good
faith to make such amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so
that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if
Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make such amendments (it being
understood and agreed (x) that in the event that, after commencement of the
Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms of a Superior
Proposal, including, any revision in price, the Notice Period shall be
extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least two (2) Business Days
remains in the Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies
Parent of any such material revision and (y) that there may be multiple
extensions of the Notice Period); and (C) Parent does not make, within the
Notice Period, a proposal that is determined by the Company Board (after
consultation with the Companys financial advisor and outside counsel), to
cause the Intervening Event to no longer form the basis for the Company
Board to effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation or cause the offer
previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal, as the case may be.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
disclosure (other than any "stop, look and listen" letter or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) shall be deemed to be a Change in Company Board Recommendation unless the
Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation
(i) in such communication or (ii) within two (2) Business Days
after requested to do so by Parent.

 



50 Section 5.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to make or cause
to be made, in cooperation with the other parties hereto and to the extent
applicable: (i) within ten (10) Business Days after the Agreement Date an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the Mergers; and (ii) as promptly as practicable after the
Agreement Date all other necessary filings, forms, declarations,
notifications, registrations and notices with other Governmental Bodies under
other applicable Antitrust Laws relating to the Mergers. Each party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to: (A) respond at the earliest practicable date
to any requests for additional information made by the U.S. Department of
Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, or any other Governmental Body relating
to the Mergers; (B) act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other
parties in connection with any investigation by any Governmental Body under
any Antitrust Law relating to the Mergers; (C) furnish to each other all
information required for any filing, form, declaration, notification,
registration and notice under any Antitrust Law relating to the Mergers,
subject to advice of such partys counsel; and (D) request early termination
of the waiting period under the HSR Act and take all other actions reasonably
necessary consistent with this _Section 5.5_ to cause, as soon as reasonably
possible (and in any event, not later than the Outside Date), the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or any
other Antitrust Law relating to the Mergers and the occurrence of the
Effective Times. In connection with the foregoing, each party hereto shall use
its reasonable best efforts: (w) to give the other party reasonable prior
notice of any communication with, and any proposed understanding or agreement
with, any Governmental Body regarding any investigations, proceedings,
filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations or notices, and
permit the other parties to review and discuss in advance, and consider in
good faith the views of the other parties in connection with, any proposed
communication, understanding or agreement with any Governmental Body, in each
case under any Antitrust Law relating to the Mergers, subject to an
appropriate confidentiality agreement and the advice of such partys antitrust
counsel; (x) to give the other parties advance notice of, and permit the other
party to participate in, any substantive meeting or conversation with any
Governmental Body in respect of any filings or inquiry under any Antitrust Law
relating to the Mergers; (y) if attending a meeting, conference, or
conversation with a Governmental Body under any Antitrust Law relating to the
Mergers, from which another party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the
applicable Governmental Body from participating in or attending, to keep the
other party reasonably apprised with respect thereto; and (z) to consult and
cooperate with the other parties in connection with any information or
proposals submitted in connection with any proceeding, inquiry, or other
proceeding under any Antitrust Law relating to the Mergers. Notwithstanding
the cooperation of the parties required by this  _Section 5.5(a)_, in the
event that the parties do not agree with respect to any matter in connection
with the required clearances and approvals from Governmental Bodies, the
Parent Parties, after considering in good faith the views of the Company,
shall have ultimate authority to decide such matters. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts:
(1) to avoid the entry of any Restraint; and (2) to eliminate
every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Body so as to enable the Effective Times to occur as soon as
reasonably possible (and in any event, not later than the Outside Date). For
purposes of this  _Section 5.5(a)_, " _reasonable best efforts_ " shall
include (I) contesting and resisting any Legal Proceeding, and to avoid the
entry of and, if necessary, have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
Restraint that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the
Mergers or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
Antitrust Law; and (II) the obligation by the Parent Parties and any of their
Subsidiaries to offer and consent to, and thereafter to implement, any of the
following measures if doing so would enable the parties to avoid, resolve, or
lift a Restraint or Legal Proceeding under this _Section 5.5(a)_: (i) sell,
license, assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any
assets, business or portion of business of the Company, the Surviving
Corporations, Parent, Holdco or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (ii)
conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets, business
or portion of business of the Company, the Surviving Corporations, Parent,
Holdco or any of their respective Subsidiaries in any manner, or (iii) impose
any restriction, requirement or limitation on the operation of the business
or portion of the business of the Company, the Surviving Corporations, Parent,
Holdco or any of their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the Parent
Parties shall be required to take, or cause to be taken, any action that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on any of Parent, Holdco, the Company, the Surviving
Corporations or any of their respective Subsidiaries in an amount that would
be material to the Company or to Parent; _provided_ , _further_ , that, if
requested by Parent, the Company will become subject to, consent to, or offer
or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any such
requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long
as such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order
is only binding on the Company in the event the Closing occurs.

 



51 (b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Parent Parties and Company shall use its and their reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties hereto
in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
using reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary actions or non-actions,
waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from all Governmental
Bodies and make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with all
Governmental Bodies, that are necessary to consummate the Mergers; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) all obligations of the Company and the
Parent Parties relating to the Debt Financing shall be governed exclusively by
_Section 5.13_, and not this _Section 5.5_ and (ii) all obligations of the
Company and the Parent Parties relating to the HSR Act and other Antitrust
Laws shall be governed exclusively by _Section 5.5(a)_ and not this _Section
5.5(b)_.

 

Section 5.6 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press release
to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Except as permitted in
accordance with _Section 5.4_, the Company shall thereafter consult with
Parent before issuing, and give Parent the reasonable opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
the Transactions and consider in good faith the views of Parent, and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange or trading market on which securities of the Company are
listed, in which case the Company shall allow Parent reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

Section 5.7  _Director and Officer Liability_.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Holdco shall and shall cause the Company,
the Company Surviving Corporation or any of their respective applicable
Subsidiaries, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to: (i) indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, against any costs or expenses (including attorneys
fees and expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present
directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (in all of
their capacities) (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") to the same extent such
persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of
the Agreement Date by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant
to the Company Charter Documents, other charter and organizational documents
of the Company Subsidiaries and the indemnification agreements in
existence on the date hereof with any Indemnified Party; and (ii) cause to be
maintained in effect in the Companys or the Company Surviving Corporations
(or any successors), as the case may be, charter and bylaws for a period of
six (6) years after the Closing, the current provisions regarding limitation
of liability and advancement of expenses of Indemnified Parties contained in
the Company Charter Documents.

 



52 (b) If the Company or the Company Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with
or merge into any other corporations or entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then and in each such case to the
extent necessary, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Company or the Company Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.7_.

(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Company Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Company Surviving Corporation
to) maintain in effect directors and officers liability insurance in respect
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Times, covering
each person covered by the Companys currently in force directors and
officers liability insurance (" _Current Company D andO Insurance_"), on terms
with respect to the coverage and amounts that are no less favorable than those
of the Current Company DandO Insurance;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in
satisfying its obligations under this _Section 5.7(c)_, Parent and the
Company Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in
excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the amount per annum the Company
paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement (such
three hundred percent (300%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ ");
_provided_ , _further_ , that, if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the Company Surviving Corporation
shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for
the Maximum Annual Premium; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Parent Parties
obligations in this _Section 5.7(c)_ shall be deemed satisfied by the Company
purchasing a "tail" or "runoff" policy. Prior to the Effective Times,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may, at or prior to the Closing, purchase a six (6) year "tail" or
"runoff" prepaid policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Parties, than the existing directors and officers liability
(and fiduciary) insurance maintained by the Company, covering, without
limitation, the Transactions and Holdco shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to maintain such "tail" or "runoff" prepaid policy in full force and effect
for six (6) years after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the premium
with respect to such "tail" or "runoff" policy shall not exceed 300% of the
amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the
date of this Agreement (the " _Current Premium_ ") in respect of its officers
and directors liability insurance policy, which amount is set forth in
Section 5.7(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



53 (d) The Company Surviving Corporation shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to assume, honor and fulfill all obligations of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries pursuant to any written indemnification agreements with
the Indemnified Parties listed on Section 5.7(d) on the Company Disclosure
Letter.

 

Section 5.8 _Notification of Certain Events_. Each of the Company and Parent
shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, notify the other:

(a) upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it in this
Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure of such Person
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, such that any
condition to the Mergers would fail to be satisfied; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty of such party set forth herein or the conditions to
the obligations of the other party to consummate the Mergers, or the remedies
available to the parties hereto, and _provided_ , _further_ , that failure to
give any such notice shall not be treated as a breach of covenant for the
purposes of _Section 6.2(b)_, _Section 6.3(b)_, _Section 7.1(f)_ or 
_Section 7.1(g)_ of this Agreement, as applicable.

(b) to the extent the Company has Knowledge of such notice or
communication or that Parent has Knowledge of such notice or communication,
as the case may be, of any written communication from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Mergers;

 

(c) of any material written communication from any Governmental Body related
to the Mergers; and

 

(d) of any proceedings commenced and served upon it or any Company
Subsidiaries, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in
writing against the Company or any Company Subsidiaries, that, if pending on
the Agreement Date, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant
to any Section of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.9 _Stockholder Litigation_. Prior to the earlier of the Effective
Times or the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_
and subject to applicable Law: (a) the Company shall promptly advise Parent in
writing of any stockholder litigation against the Company or its directors
relating to this Agreement or the Mergers and shall keep Parent fully
informed regarding any such stockholder litigation; (b) the Company shall give
Parent reasonable opportunity, at Parents sole cost and expense, to
participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in the defense
of any action, claim, suit or proceeding against the Company or its directors
or officers relating to the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated
hereby, and no such settlement will be agreed to or offered without the prior
written consent of Parent. Each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate in the defense or
negotiation or settlement of any litigation contemplated by this _Section
5.9_. The parties acknowledge that this _Section 5.9_ in no way limits the
parties obligations under _Section 5.5(a)_.

 



54 Section 5.10 _[Intentionally Omitted]_.

 

Section 5.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For purposes of this _Section 5.11_, (i) the term " _Covered Employees_ "
shall mean employees who are actively employed by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary immediately after the Effective Times; and (ii) the term "
_Continuation Period_ " shall mean the period beginning at the Effective Times
and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Times.

(b) During the Continuation Period, Holdco shall, or shall cause a Subsidiary
of Holdco to, provide to the Covered Employees for so long as such Covered
Employees remain employees of Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries during the
Continuation Period, compensation (such term to include salary, annual cash
bonus opportunities, commissions and severance) and benefits that are in the
aggregate, no less favorable than the compensation (excluding any equity or
equity-based compensation, retention, change of control, transaction or
similar bonuses, and nonqualified deferred compensation) and benefits
(excluding, any defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical benefits)
being provided to Covered Employees immediately prior to the Effective Times.

 

(c) In the event any Covered Employee first becomes eligible to participate
under any employee benefit plan, program, policy, or arrangement of Holdco or
any of its Subsidiaries (" _Holdco Employee Benefit Plan_ ") following the
Effective Times, Holdco shall, or shall cause a Subsidiary of Holdco to, for
Covered Employees who become eligible during the calendar year including the
Effective Times, use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive any
preexisting condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to any Covered Employee
under any Holdco Employee Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, or vision
benefits to the same extent such limitation would have been waived or
satisfied under the Company Employee Benefit Plan the Covered Employee
participated in immediately prior to coverage under the Holdco Employee
Benefit Plan; and (ii) provide each Covered Employee with credit for any
copayments and deductibles paid prior to the Covered Employees coverage under
any Holdco Employee Benefit Plan during the plan year in which the Effective
Times occur, to the same extent such credit was given under the employee
benefit plan Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage
under the Holdco Employee Benefit Plan, in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the Holdco Employee
Benefit Plan for the plan year in which the Effective Times occur.

 



55 (d) As of the Effective Times, Holdco shall recognize, or shall cause a
Subsidiary of Holdco to recognize, all service of each Covered Employee prior
to the Effective Times, to the Company (or any predecessor entities of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries) for vesting and eligibility
purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit
pension plan) and for purposes of determining future vacation accruals and
severance amounts to the same extent as such Covered Employee received,
immediately before the Effective Times, credit for such service under
any similar Company Plan in which such Covered Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Times; _provided_ that service of each
Covered Employee prior to the Effective Times shall not be recognized for the
purpose of any entitlement to participate in, or receive benefits with
respect to, any (i) non-elective employer contributions under any plan of
Holdco under Section 401(k) of the Code; or (ii) Holdco retiree medical
program in which any Covered Employee participates after the Effective Times.
In no event shall anything contained in this _Section 5.11_ result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

 

(e) This _Section 5.11_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of the parties hereto, and nothing in this  _Section 5.11_, express or
implied, (i) shall be construed to limit the right of Holdco, Parent, the
Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate
any Company Plan or other employee benefit plan, program, policy, practice,
agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored, or
maintained by any of them, (ii) shall be construed to require Holdco, Parent,
the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to retain the employment
of any particular Person for any fixed period of time following the Effective
Times, (iii) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit
plan, program, policy, practice, agreement or arrangement or (iv) is intended
to confer upon any Person (including employees, retirees, or dependents or
beneficiaries of employees or retirees) any right as a third-party beneficiary
of this Agreement or any remedy of any nature whatsoever hereunder.

 

Section 5.12 _Confidentiality_. The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent and
the Company have previously executed a mutual confidentiality agreement,
dated as of January 12, 2016 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms, except as expressly modified herein.

Section 5.13 _Debt Financing_.

 

(a) Subject to Parents and Holdcos right to obtain alternative financing
pursuant to _Section 5.13(d)_, each of Parent and Holdco shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange, consummate and obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions (including any "market flex" provisions) described in the
Debt Commitment Letter (or terms more favorable to Parent), including using
their respective reasonable best efforts to: (i) enforce their respective
rights under the Debt Commitment Letter in the event of a breach thereof by
the Financing Sources thereunder, (ii) enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" provisions), (iii) satisfy, or
cause their Representatives to satisfy, on a timely basis all conditions (or
terms more favorable to Holdco) applicable to, and within the control of,
Parent or Holdco or their respective Representatives in such definitive
agreements, and (iv) upon the satisfaction of the Parents obligation to
consummate the Parent Merger, consummate the Debt Financing at the Closing
(with respect to amounts required to consummate the Mergers).

 



56 (b) Other than pursuant to "market flex" provisions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter, neither Holdco nor Parent shall agree to any amendments or
modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other provision or
remedy under the Debt Commitment Letter or Financing Agreements without the
prior written consent of the Company, to the extent such amendments,
modifications or waivers would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of aggregate
cash proceeds available from the Debt Financing (unless the Debt Financing or
cash on hand of Holdco or Parent is increased by a corresponding amount) to
fund the amounts required to be paid by Parent or Holdco under this Agreement
(as compared to the amount of such aggregate proceeds contemplated under the
Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof), or (ii) impose new
or additional conditions precedent or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of
the conditions precedent in a manner adverse to Parent, Holdco or the Company,
including any expansion, amendment or modification that would be reasonably
likely to (A) prevent or delay or impair the ability of Parent and Holdco to
obtain the funding in full of the Debt Financing or (B) adversely impact the
ability of Parent to enforce its rights or remedies against the other parties
to the Debt Commitment Letter or Financing Agreements ( _provided_ that Parent
may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add or replace lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities so long as such
action would not reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing or
Parents ability to consummate the Debt Financing). Neither Parent nor Holdco
shall release or consent to the termination of the obligations of the lenders
and other Persons under the Debt Commitment Letter or Financing Agreements (
_provided_ that Holdco may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add or replace
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
so long as such action would not reasonably be expected to delay or prevent
the Closing or Parents ability to consummate the Debt Financing).

(c) [Reserved]. 

(d) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes or is
reasonably likely to become unavailable in the manner or from the sources
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter or Financing Agreements and such
portion of the Debt Financing is reasonably required to consummate the Mergers
and other transactions contemplated hereby, (i) Parent shall promptly so
notify the Company and (ii) Parent and Holdco shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from the same or
alternative financial institutions in an amount sufficient to consummate the
Transactions on terms and conditions that are not materially less favorable,
in the aggregate, to Parent and Holdco than those in the Debt Commitment
Letter that such alternative financing would replace (taking into account any
flex provisions), as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event. The definitive agreements entered into pursuant to the first sentence
of this _Section 5.13(d)_ or  _Section 5.13(a)(ii)_ are referred to in this
Agreement, collectively, as the " _Financing Agreements_." For purposes of the
foregoing, (i) the term " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " shall be deemed to
include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any
alternative debt financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt
Commitment Letters remaining in effect at the time in question), and any fee
letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any alternative debt financing
arranged in compliance with herewith. Without first obtaining the Companys
prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), neither Parent nor Holdco shall directly or indirectly take any
action that would, or would be reasonably expected to, result in the Debt
Financing not being available.

 



57 (e) Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete and executed copies of the
Financing Agreements or any alternative financing agreement entered into in
accordance with this _Section 5.13_ promptly upon their execution and
following request by the Company, (ii) give the Company prompt notice of any
breach or written threatened breach of which either Parent or Holdco is or
becomes aware by any party of the Debt Commitment Letter, any alternative
financing commitment, the Financing Agreements, or any alternative financing
agreement entered into in accordance with this _Section 5.13_ or any
termination or threatened termination thereof, in each case of which either
Parent or Holdco is or becomes aware, and (iii) otherwise keep the Company
reasonably informed in a timely manner of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing under this _Section
5.13_).

(f) Each of Holdco and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of
the Debt Financing (including any alternative financing) or any portion
thereof is not a condition to the Closing.

 

Section 5.14 _Financing Cooperation and Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.14(c)_, prior to the Effective Times, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their Representatives to, provide to
Holdco and Parent such customary cooperation, at Parents sole expense, as may
be reasonably requested by Holdco or Parent to assist Holdco or Parent in

such customary cooperation as is otherwise reasonably requested by Holdco or
Parent solely in connection with obtaining the Debt Financing, which
cooperation shall consist of (without limitation):

expertise, including its senior executive officers, and external auditors to
assist in preparation for and to participate in a reasonable number of

presentations, road show materials, bank information memoranda, credit

(iii) subject to _Section 5.1_, furnishing Parent and its Representatives

Subsidiaries contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter to be delivered after
the date of this Agreement, as is necessary or customary in connection with
the Debt Financing, in each case, as and when it becomes available (in the
case of the Financing Information, at the times required by the Debt
Commitment Letter); _provided_ that without limiting the generality of
_Section 5.1_, information obtained by Parent and its Financing Sources
pursuant to this _Section 5.14_ will constitute "Confidential Information"
under the Confidentiality Agreement and will be subject to the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company
hereby consents to the inclusion of the Financing Sources
as "Representatives" thereunder and the disclosure of information to the
Financing Sources pursuant to Section 3(a) thereof;

 



58 (iv) using reasonable best efforts to assist Holdco and Parent in
obtaining corporate and facilities ratings in connection with the Debt
Financing;

(v) reasonably cooperating to permit the prospective lenders involved in the
Debt Financing to evaluate the Company and the Company Subsidiaries current
assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and procedures
relating thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements to
the extent customary and reasonable and otherwise reasonably facilitating the
grant of a security interest in collateral and providing related lender
protections;

 

(vi) obtaining such consents, approvals, authorizations and instruments which
may be reasonably requested by Holdco or Parent in connection with the Debt
Financing and collateral arrangements, including, without limitation, legal
opinions, surveys and title insurance, customary payoff letters, Lien
terminations and instruments of discharge to allow for the payoff, discharge
and termination in full of all Indebtedness listed in _Section 5.14(a)(vi)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter and Liens thereunder (the " _Debt Payoff_ ");

 

(vii) to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, cooperating with due
diligence requests from the Financing Sources, including furnishing Parent
and its Financing Sources promptly, and in any event at least ten (10) days
prior to the Closing Date, with all documentation and other information
required by Governmental Bodies with respect to the Debt Financing under
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the PATRIOT Act;

 

(viii) using commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the syndication
efforts for the Debt Financing benefit materially from the Companys existing
lending and banking relationships;

(ix) facilitating the pledging of collateral for the Debt Financing,
including executing and delivering any customary pledge and security
documents, credit agreements, ancillary loan documents and customary closing
certificates and documents (in each case, subject to and only effective upon
occurrence of the Effective Times) and assisting in preparing schedules
thereto as may be reasonably requested by Holdco or Parent;

 

(x) providing customary authorization letters authorizing the distribution of
information to prospective lenders and containing a customary representation
to the Financing Sources for the Debt Financing that such information does not
contain a material misstatement or omission and containing a representation to
the Financing Sources that the public side versions of such documents, if
any, do not include material non-public information about the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries or their securities; and

 



59 (xi) using reasonable best efforts to cause accountants to consent to the use
of their reports in any material relating to the Debt Financing.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall
ensure that all financial and other projections concerning the Company and
its Subsidiaries that are made available to Parent after the date of this
Agreement are prepared in good faith and the Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to provide to Parent and its Financing Sources such information
as may be necessary so that the Financing Information is complete and correct
in all material respects and does not and will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements contained therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which such statements are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the parties agree that the condition set
forth in _Section 6.2(b)_, as applied to the Companys obligations under this
_Section 5.14(a)_, shall be deemed satisfied unless the Debt Financing has
not been obtained as a proximate result of the Companys material breach of
its obligations under this _Section 5.14(a)_.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including this _Section 5.14_): (i) nothing in this Agreement shall require
any such cooperation to the extent that it would (a) require the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives, as
applicable, to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any
commitment or other fees or reimburse any expenses that are not contingent
upon the Effective Times or incur any liability or give any indemnities that
are not contingent upon the Effective Times, (b) unreasonably interfere with
the ongoing business or operations of the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries, (c) require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
take any action that will conflict with or violate the Company Charter
Documents, any Laws or the Existing Credit Agreement or result in the
contravention of, or that would reasonably be expected to result in a
violation or breach of, or default under, any Company Material Contract, (d)
require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into or
approve any financing or purchase agreement for the Debt Financing prior to
the Effective Times, (e) result in any significant interference with the
prompt and timely discharge of the duties of any of the Companys executive
officers, (f) result in the Company or any Company Subsidiary incurring any
liability with respect to any matters relating to the Debt Financing prior to

Company Subsidiary incurring personal liability with respect to any matters
relating to the Debt Financing; (ii) no liability or obligation (including any
obligation to pay any commitment or other fees or reimburse any expenses) of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives under any certificate, agreement, arrangement,
document or instrument relating to the Debt Financing (other than customary
authorization letters) shall be effective until (or that is not contingent
upon) the Effective Times; and (iii) none of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives shall have any
liability or incur any losses, damages or penalties to the Financing Sources
with respect to the Debt Financing or any marketing materials, presentations
or disclosure documents in connection therewith in the event the Closing does
not occur (other than with respect to authorization letters referred to
above).

 



60 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_,
Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all of its documented reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives in connection with any cooperation
contemplated by this _Section 5.14_.

(d) Parent shall, in the event the Closing does not occur, indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered
or incurred by any of them in connection with the Debt Financing, the
arrangement of the Debt Financing, the Debt Payoff and/or the provision of
information utilized in connection therewith to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, except, in each case, insofar as such liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments or penalties
arose out of or resulted from the fraud, willful misconduct or gross
negligence of the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries or their
Representatives.

(e) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and the
Company Subsidiaries Trademarks in connection with the Debt Financing;
_provided_ that such Trademarks are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries.

Section 5.15 _401(k) Plans_. Unless otherwise requested in writing by Parent,
the Company Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt
resolutions and take such corporate action as is necessary to terminate any
Company Plan intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement
under Section 401(k) of the Code (collectively, the " _Company 401(k) Plans_
"), effective no later than the day immediately prior to the Closing Date and,
effective as of such date, no employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall have any right thereafter to contribute any amounts to the
Company 401(k) Plans. The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment, in advance of any such adoption or
corporate action, on any such resolutions or corporation actions.

Section 5.16 _Section 16 Matters_. The parties hereto shall take all
such steps as may reasonably be required to cause the transactions

16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Parent, Holdco or the Company, to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



61 Section 5.17 _Filing of Form S-8; Listing of Additional Shares_. Holdco agrees

Form S-8 (or any successor form) (if available) with respect to the shares of
Holdco Common Stock issuable with respect to Holdco Options and Holdco RSUs
issuable pursuant to _Section 2.5_ or _Section 2.6_ and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the
Holdco Options and Holdco RSUs issuable pursuant to _Section 2.5_ or _Section
2.6_ remain outstanding. Holdco shall at times ensure that there will remain
a sufficient number of unissued shares of Holdco Common Stock to meet its
share issuance obligations in connection with the Holdco Options and Holdco
RSUs. Holdco shall take all action reasonably necessary to cause the shares
of Holdco Common Stock to be issuable upon the exercise of Holdco Options, to

breach is not curable by the Outside Date, or, if curable through the
exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, is not cured within fifteen (15)
Business Days of the date Parent gives the Company notice of such breach or
inaccuracy; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(f)_ if the Parent

(ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability as a result
of fraud or the willful and material breach by such party of its
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or other agreements set
forth in this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, " _willful and
material breach_ " shall mean a material breach that is a consequence of an
act undertaken by the breaching party with the knowledge that the taking of
such act, or failure to act, would, or would be reasonably expected to, result

Section 7.3 _Termination Fees_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost
or expense.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (i) _Section
7.1(e)_, (ii) _Section 7.1(d)_ at any time after the occurrence of any
Triggering Event or (iii) _Section 7.1(h)_, then the Company shall pay to
Parent the Termination Fee. The Termination Fee payable pursuant to this 
_Section 7.3(b)_ shall be paid no later than the second (2nd) Business Day
following termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_ or _Section 7.1(d)_ at
any time after the occurrence of any Triggering Event and concurrently with
any termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_.

(c) If (i) after the date of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall
have become publicly known or delivered to the Company Board and not publicly
withdrawn, (ii) thereafter, this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ or  _Section 7.1(d)_ or (B) by Parent
pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_, and (iii) within twelve (12) months after such
termination the Company shall have (A) entered into a definitive agreement
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal that is subsequently consummated or
(B) consummated a transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal, then

66 (d) All payments under this _Section 7.3_ shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the party
to whom payment is owed.

(e) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Termination Fee shall be payable only once and not in
duplication even though the Termination Fee may be payable under one or more
provisions hereof. If the Company fails promptly to pay the Termination
Fee when due and payable pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences an action or other proceeding that
results in an award against the Company for such Termination Fee, the Company
shall pay Parents costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such action or proceeding, together with
interest on the amount of the Termination Fee from the date such payment was
required to be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.

 

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS_

 

Section 8.1 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Times, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects
by written agreement signed by all of the parties hereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there
shall be made no amendment or supplement that by Law requires
further approval by the stockholders of the Company without the further
approval of such stockholders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
_Section 8.4_, _Section 8.5_, _Section 8.12_ and this _Section 8.1_
(and the related definitions in this Agreement used therein, but only with
respect to their use in such Sections as they relate specifically to the
Financing Sources) shall not be amended, modified, supplemented or waived in a
manner that is adverse to any Financing Source without the prior written
consent of the adversely affected Financing Sources.

Section 8.2 _Extension of Time, Waiver, etc_. Any party may, subject to
applicable Law: (a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of any other party hereto; (b) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or acts of any other party hereto; or (c) to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, waive compliance by the other party with
any of the agreements contained in this Agreement or, except as otherwise
provided in the Agreement, waive any of such partys conditions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the parties hereto in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of rights, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of such rights preclude any other or
further exercise of such rights or the exercise of any other right hereunder.
Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such party.

 

Section 8.3 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Letter or in any certificate or schedule or other document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Mergers.

 



67 Section 8.4 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiary_. This Agreement,
including the exhibits and annexes hereto, the Company Disclosure Letter, the
documents and instruments relating to the Transactions referred to in this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement,
and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement. This Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to create
any agreement of employment with any person, to confer any rights or remedies
upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary
hereto, except (i) with respect to the Indemnified Parties covered by
_Section 5.7_, (ii) with respect to _Section 8.1_, _Section 8.5_, _Section
8.12_ and this _Section 8.4_, which are intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, Financing Sources, to the extent related to the Debt
Financing and (iii) that the Company shall have the right (which right is
hereby acknowledged by the Parent Parties) to pursue damages (including claims
for damages based on loss of the economic benefit of the transaction to the
Companys stockholders) on behalf of its stockholders in the event any of the
Parent Parties commit fraud or the willful and material breach by such party
of its representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or other
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which rights under this clause (iii)
shall be enforceable on behalf of the Companys stockholders only by the
Company, in its sole and absolute discretion through actions approved by the
Company Board.

Section 8.5 _Applicable Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement and all actions (whether at law, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation,
validity or performance of this Agreement or the Mergers shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles
of conflicts of laws. All actions and proceedings (whether at law, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement or the Mergers
shall be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, and the parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such court
(and, in the case of appeals, the appropriate appellate court therefrom), in
any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. The
parties agree that service of any court paper may be made in any manner as may
be provided under the applicable Laws or court rules governing service
of process in such court. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER AT LAW, IN CONTRACT,
IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE DEBT
FINANCING.

 



68 (b) Notwithstanding _Section 8.5(a)_, each of the parties hereto agrees that
it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim
or third-party claim of any kind or nature (whether at law, in contract, in
tort or otherwise) against any Financing Source relating to this Agreement,
the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing other than in the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or if under applicable Law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in Federal courts, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts
thereof).

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto agree
that any claim, controversy or dispute of any kind or nature (whether based
upon contract, tort or otherwise) involving a Financing Source that is in any
way related to this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the Debt
Commitment Letter shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of New York.

 

Section 8.6 _Specific Enforcement_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto shall be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any
one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy and nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific
performance or injunctive relief. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled
to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity,
and the parties hereto hereby waive the requirement of any posting of a bond
in connection with the remedies described herein.

Section 8.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise),
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to
make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except
that Company Merger Sub may (i) assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of
its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any one or more
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Holdco without the consent of
the Company and (ii) pledge its rights hereunder as security to its Financing
Source; _provided_ that no assignment shall relieve Company Merger Sub of any
of its obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that any
such pledge shall not be effective until the Effective Times. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns.

70 Section 8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of
this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto
agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit
such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace
such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable
term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or
provision.

ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be
applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

ARTICLE II

 

 _MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS_

 

Section 1\. _Place of_ ___Meetings_. Meetings of the stockholders for the
election of directors or for any other purpose shall be held at such time and
place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be designated
from time to time by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may, in

State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ").

 

Section 2\. _Annual Meetings_. The Annual Meeting of Stockholders for the
election of directors shall be held on such date and at such time as shall be
designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. Any other proper
business may be transacted at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

 



B-2-5 Section 3\. _Special Meetings_. Unless otherwise required by law or by the
certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, as amended and restated from
time to time (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ "), Special Meetings of

Chairman, if there be one, or (ii) the President, (iii) any Vice President,
if there be one, (iv) the Secretary or (v) any Assistant Secretary, if there
be one, and shall be called by any such officer at the request in writing of
(i) the Board of Directors, (ii) a committee of the Board of Directors that
has been duly designated by the Board of Directors and whose powers and
authority include the power to call such meetings or (iii) stockholders owning
a majority of the capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the
proposed meeting. At a Special Meeting of Stockholders, only such business
shall be conducted as shall be specified in the notice of meeting (or any
supplement thereto).

Section 4\. _Notice_. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take
any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given which
shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of
remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be
deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of
a Special Meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
Unless otherwise required by law, written notice of any meeting shall be given
not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the
meeting to each stockholder entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting.

 



B-2-6 Section 5\. _Adjournments_. Any meeting of the stockholders may be adjourned
from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice
need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any,
thereof and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders
and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such
adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record
date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting in
accordance with the requirements of Section 4 hereof shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting.

Section 6\. _Quorum_. Unless otherwise required by applicable law or the
Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of a majority of the Corporations
capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in
person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of
the stockholders for the transaction of business. A quorum, once established,
shall not be broken by the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a
quorum. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any
meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat,
present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the
meeting from time to time, in the manner provided in Section 5 hereof, until a
quorum shall be present or represented.

 



B-2-7 Section 7\. _Voting_. Unless otherwise required by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, or permitted by the rules of any stock
exchange on which the Corporations shares are listed and traded, any question
brought before any meeting of the stockholders, other than the election of
directors, shall be decided by the vote of the holders of a majority of the
total number of votes of the Corporations capital stock represented at the
meeting and entitled to vote on such question, voting as a single class.
Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, and subject to
Section 11(a) of this Article II, each stockholder represented at a meeting of
the stockholders shall be entitled to cast one (1) vote for each share of the
capital stock entitled to vote thereat held by such stockholder. Such votes
may be cast in person or by proxy as provided in Section 8 of this Article II.
The Board of Directors, in its discretion, or the officer of the Corporation
presiding at a meeting of the stockholders, in such officers discretion, may
require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.

Section 8.  _Proxies_. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of the
stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder as proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted upon after three years
from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. Without
limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or
persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, the following shall constitute
a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority:

(i) A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons
to act for such stockholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the
stockholder or such stockholders authorized officer, director, employee or
agent signing such writing or causing such persons signature to be affixed
to such writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by
facsimile signature.

 



B-2-8 (ii) A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for
such stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of
a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the person
who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy
support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who
will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that
any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must
either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be
determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was
authorized by the stockholder. If it is determined that such telegrams,
cablegrams or other electronic transmissions are valid, the inspectors or, if
there are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall
specify the information on which they relied.

Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the
writing or transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy
for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing
or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or
transmission could be used; provided, however, that such copy, facsimile
telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of
the entire original writing or transmission.

 



B-2-9 Section 9\. _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_. Unless otherwise
provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or
permitted to be taken at any Annual or Special Meeting of Stockholders of the
Corporation may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a
vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken,
shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present
and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its
registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business,
or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of the stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the
Corporations registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested. Every written consent shall bear the date
of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent
shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless,
within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered in the manner
required by this Section 9 to the Corporation, written consents signed by a
sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered to the Corporation
by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal
place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody
of the book in which proceedings of meetings of the stockholders are recorded.
A telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission consenting to an action
to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person
or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed
to be written, signed and dated for the purposes of this Section 9, provided
that any such telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission sets forth
or is delivered with information from which the Corporation can determine (i)
that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was transmitted
by the stockholder or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act
for the stockholder or proxyholder and (ii) the date on which such stockholder
or proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such telegram,
cablegram or electronic transmission. The date on which such telegram,
cablegram or electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the
date on which such consent was signed. No consent given by telegram, cablegram
or other electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until
such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be
delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State
of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the
Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
the stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporations registered
office shall be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested. Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a
consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing
for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used,
provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing. Prompt notice of the taking of
the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent
shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and
who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to
notice of the meeting if the record date for such meeting had been the date
that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the
action were delivered to the Corporation as provided above in this Section
9\.

 



B-2-10 Section 10\. _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The officer of the
Corporation who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall
prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of the
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder,
for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for
a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting (i) on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain
access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii)
during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the
Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list
available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps
to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the
Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be
produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time
thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the
meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list
shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time
of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the
information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of
the meeting.

 



B-2-11 Section 11\. _Record Date_.

 

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of the stockholders or any adjournment
thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more
than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting.
If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the
stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the
day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A
determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of the stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for
the adjourned meeting.

 



B-2-12 (b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than ten (10) days after
the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board of Directors. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of
Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent
to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the
Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on
which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to
be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office
in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or
agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of
meetings of the stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporations
registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors
and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior
action.

Section 12\. _Stock Ledger_. The stock ledger of the Corporation shall be the
only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock
ledger, the list required by Section 10 of this Article II or the books of the
Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of the
stockholders.

 



B-2-13 Section 13\. _Conduct of Meetings_. The Board of Directors of the Corporation
may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of any
meeting of the stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent
inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of
Directors, the chairman of any meeting of the stockholders shall have the
right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to
do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the
proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether
adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the
meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment
of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) the determination of
when the polls shall open and close for any given matter to be voted on at the
meeting; (iii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and
the safety of those present; (iv) limitations on attendance at or
participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation,
their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the

to time by the Board of Directors. Except as provided in Section 2 of this
Article III, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at

these Bylaws required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.

 



B-2-15 Section 4\. _Meetings_. The Board of Directors and any committee thereof may
hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State

member of such committee) either by mail not less than forty-eight (48) hours
before the date of the meeting, by telephone, telegram or electronic means on

none, a director chosen by a majority of the directors present, shall act as
chairman. Except as provided below, the Secretary of the Corporation shall act
as secretary at each meeting of the Board of Directors and of each committee
thereof. In case the Secretary shall be absent from any meeting of the Board
of Directors or of any committee thereof, an Assistant Secretary shall perform
the duties of secretary at such meeting; and in the absence from any such
meeting of the Secretary and all the Assistant Secretaries, the chairman
of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the members of each committee of the Board of
Directors may appoint any person to act as secretary of any meeting of such
committee and the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Corporation
may, but need not if such committee so elects, serve in such capacity.

 



B-2-16 Section 6\. _Resignations and Removals of Directors_. Any director of the
Corporation may resign from the Board of Directors or any committee thereof
at any time, by giving notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the
Chairman of the Board of Directors, if there be one, the President or the
Secretary of the Corporation and, in the case of a committee, to the chairman
of such committee, if there be one. Such resignation shall take effect at the
time therein specified or, if no time is specified, immediately; and, unless
otherwise specified in such notice, the acceptance of such resignation shall
not be necessary to make it effective. Except as otherwise required by
applicable law and subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of
preferred stock then outstanding, any director or the entire Board
of Directors may be removed from office at any time, by the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least a majority in voting power of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election
of directors. Any director serving on a committee of the Board of Directors
may be removed from such committee at any time by the Board of Directors.

 

Section 7\. _Quorum_. Except as otherwise required by law, or the Certificate
of Incorporation or the rules and regulations of any securities exchange or
quotation system on which the Corporations securities are listed or quoted
for trading, at all meetings of the Board of Directors or any committee
thereof, a majority of the entire Board of Directors or a majority of
the directors constituting such committee, as the case may be, shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority
of the directors or committee members present at any meeting at which there is
a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors or such committee, as
applicable. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof, the directors present thereat may adjourn
the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the
meeting of the time and place of the adjourned meeting, until a quorum shall
be present.

 



B-2-17 Section 8\. _Actions of the Board by Written Consent_. Unless otherwise
provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action
required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or
of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all the members of
the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto
in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or
electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of
proceedings of the Board of Directors or such committee. Such filing shall be

participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or such committee by means
of a conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of
which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and
participation in a meeting pursuant to this Section 9 shall constitute
presence in person at such meeting.

 



B-2-18 Section 10\. _Committees_. The Board of Directors may designate one or more
committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the
Corporation. Each member of a committee must meet the requirements for
membership, if any, imposed by applicable law and the rules and regulations of
any securities exchange or quotation system on which the securities of the
Corporation are listed or quoted for trading. The Board of Directors may
designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may
replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of any such
committee. Subject to the rules and regulations of any securities exchange or
quotation system on which the securities of the Corporation are listed or
quoted for trading, in the absence or disqualification of a member of
a committee, and in the absence of a designation by the Board of Directors of
an alternate member to replace the absent or disqualified member, the member
or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting,
whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously
appoint another qualified member of the Board of Directors to act at the
meeting in the place of any absent or disqualified member. Any committee, to
the extent permitted by law and provided in the resolution establishing such
committee, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the
Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the
Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to
all papers which may require it. Each committee shall keep regular minutes and
report to the Board of Directors when required. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Article III, the resolution of the Board
of Directors establishing any committee of the Board of Directors and/or the
charter of any such committee may establish requirements or procedures
relating to the governance and/or operation of such committee that are
different from, or in addition to, those set forth in these Bylaws and, to
the extent that there is any inconsistency between these Bylaws and any such
resolution or charter, the terms of such resolution or charter shall be
controlling.

 

Section 11\. _Compensation_. The directors may be paid their expenses, if any,
of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a
fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or a stated
salary for service as director, payable in cash or securities. No such payment
shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other
capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing
committees may be allowed like compensation for service as committee members.

 



B-2-19 Section 12\. _Interested Directors_. No contract or transaction between the
Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the
Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or other
organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors
or officers or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely
for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or
participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof
which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because any such
directors or officers vote is counted for such purpose if: (i) the material
facts as to the directors or officers relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors
or the committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith
authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority
of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be
less than a quorum; or (ii) the material facts as to the directors or
officers relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are
disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and
the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of
the stockholders; or (iii) the contract or transaction is fair as to the
Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified by the Board
of Directors, a committee thereof or the stockholders. Common or interested
directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting
of the Board of Directors or of a committee which authorizes the contract or
transaction.

certificate, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate, or such owners legal representative, to advertise
the same in such manner as the Board of Directors shall require and/or to give

transfer and payment of all necessary transfer taxes; provided, however, that
such surrender and endorsement or payment of taxes shall not be required in
any case in which the officers of the Corporation shall determine to waive
such requirement. Every certificate exchanged, returned or surrendered to the
Corporation shall be marked "Cancelled," with the date of cancellation, by the

the same shall be deposited in the United States mail. Without limiting the
manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any
notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a
form of electronic transmission if consented to by the stockholder to whom the
notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by
written notice to the Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed to be
revoked if (i) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic
transmission two (2) consecutive notices by the Corporation in accordance with
such consent and (ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or
Assistant Secretary of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other
person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, that the
inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not
invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given by electronic
transmission, as described above, shall be deemed given: (i) if by facsimile
telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has
consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to
an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive
notice; (iii) if by a posting on an electronic network, together with separate
notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such
posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and (iv) if by any other
form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. Notice to
directors or committee members may be given personally or by telegram, telex,
cable or by means of electronic transmission.

Section 2\. _Waivers of Notice_. Whenever any notice is required by applicable
law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, to be given to any
director, member of a committee or stockholder, a waiver thereof in writing,
signed by the person or persons entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic
transmission by the person or persons entitled to notice, whether before or
after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto. Attendance
of a person at a meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where the person
attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of
the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at,
nor the purpose of, any Annual or Special Meeting of Stockholders or any
regular or special meeting of the directors or members of a committee of
directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required
by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

consent in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 8 of Article III hereof),
and may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the Corporations

ARTICLE VIII

_INDEMNIFICATION _

Section 1\. _Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings other than
Those by or in the Right of the Corporation_. Subject to Section 3 of this
Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party
or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation), by
reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving
at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good
faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such persons conduct
was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not
act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect
to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that
such persons conduct was unlawful.

 



B-2-31 Section 2\. _Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the
Right of the Corporation_. Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the
Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened
to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by
or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by
reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at
the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred
by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or
suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation;
except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim,
issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable
to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought
shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability
but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery
or such other court shall deem proper. 

 



B-2-32 Section 3\. _Authorization of Indemnification_. Any indemnification under this
Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation
only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that
indemnification of the present or former director or officer is proper in the
circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be.
Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director
or officer at the time of such determination, (i) by a majority vote of the
directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though
less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a
majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if
there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent
legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the stockholders. Such
determination shall be made, with respect to former directors and officers,
by any person or persons having the authority to act on the matter on behalf
of the Corporation. To the extent, however, that a present or former director
or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise
in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense
of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified
against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred
by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of
authorization in the specific case.

Section 4\. _Good Faith Defined_. For purposes of any determination under
Section 3 of this Article VIII, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good
faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe such persons
conduct was unlawful, if such persons action is based on the records or books
of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information
supplied to such person by the officers of the Corporation or another
enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel
for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given
or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent
certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with
reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The provisions of
this Section 4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the
circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII,
as the case may be.

 



B-2-33 Section 5\. _Indemnification by a Court_. Notwithstanding any contrary
determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII, and
notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or
officer may apply to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any
other court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for
indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Section 1 or Section
2 of this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be
a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer
is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII,
as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case
under Section 3 of this Article VIII nor the absence of any determination
thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that
the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable
standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to
this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of
such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer
seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of
prosecuting such application.

Section 6.  _Expenses Payable in Advance_. Expenses (including attorneys
fees) incurred by a director or officer in defending any civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by
the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or
officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such
person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in
this Article VIII. Such expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by
former directors and officers or other employees and agents may be so paid
upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems appropriate.

 



B-2-34 Section 7\. _Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may
be entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
action in such persons official capacity and as to action in another capacity
while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that
indemnification of the persons specified in Section 1 and Section 2 of this
Article VIII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The
provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the
indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section 1 or Section 2
of this Article VIII but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to
indemnify under the provisions of the DGCL, or otherwise.

 

Section 8\. _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance
on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at
the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by
such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons status as
such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to
indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this
Article VIII.

 



B-2-35 Section 9\. _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Article VIII,
references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or officer
of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such
constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same
position under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to
the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect
to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. The
term "another enterprise" as used in this Article VIII shall mean any other
corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. For purposes of
this Article VIII, references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes
assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references
to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties
on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an
employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who
acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in
the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan
shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests
of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article VIII.

 



B-2-36 Section 10\. _Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article VIII shall, unless otherwise provided when
authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors
and administrators of such a person.

Section 11\. _Limitation on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Article VIII to the contrary, except for proceedings to
enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by Section 5 of
this Article VIII), the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any
director or officer (or his or her heirs, executors or personal or legal
representatives) or advance expenses in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof)
was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

Section 12\. _Indemnification of Employees and Agents_. The Corporation may,
to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, provide
rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and
agents of the Corporation similar to those conferred in this Article VIII to
directors and officers of the Corporation.

 



B-2-37 ARTICLE IX

 

 _AMENDMENTS_

 

Section 1\. _Amendments_. These Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed, in
whole or in part, or new Bylaws may be adopted by the stockholders or by the
Board of Directors; provided, however, that notice of such alteration,
amendment, repeal or adoption of new Bylaws be contained in the notice of such
meeting of the stockholders or Board of Directors, as the case may be.
All such amendments must be approved by either the holders of a majority of
the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote thereon or by a majority of the
entire Board of Directors then in office.

 

Section 2\. _Entire Board of Directors_. As used in this Article IX and in
these Bylaws generally, the term "entire Board of Directors" means the total
number of directors which the Corporation would have if there were no
vacancies.

actions for breach of duty to the Corporation, its stockholders and others.

(6) Any repeal or modification of any of the foregoing provisions of this
Article Fifth shall be prospective and shall not adversely affect any right
or protection of a director, officer, agent or other person existing at the
time of, or increase the liability of any director of the Corporation with
respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to, such
repeal or modification.

 



C-1-3 (7) In addition to the powers and authority hereinbefore or by statute
expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise
all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by
the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the GCL, this
Certificate of Incorporation, and any Bylaws adopted by the stockholders;
provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall

Delaware, as the Bylaws may provide. The books of the Corporation may be kept

manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon
stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

time to time by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may, in its
sole discretion, determine that a meeting of the stockholders shall not
be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote
communication in the manner authorized by the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ").

 

Section 2\. _Annual Meetings_. The Annual Meeting of Stockholders for the
election of directors shall be held on such date and at such time as shall be
designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. Any other proper
business may be transacted at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

 



C-2-5 Section 3\. _Special Meetings_. Unless otherwise required by law or by the
certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, as amended and restated from
time to time (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ "), Special Meetings of
Stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called by either (i) the
Chairman, if there be one, or (ii) the President, (iii) any Vice President,
if there be one, (iv) the Secretary or (v) any Assistant Secretary, if there
be one, and shall be called by any such officer at the request in writing of
(i) the Board of Directors, (ii) a committee of the Board of Directors that
has been duly designated by the Board of Directors and whose powers and
authority include the power to call such meetings or (iii) stockholders owning
a majority of the capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the
proposed meeting. At a Special Meeting of Stockholders, only such business
shall be conducted as shall be specified in the notice of meeting (or any
supplement thereto).

Section 4\. _Notice_. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take
any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given which
shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of
remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be
deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of
a Special Meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
Unless otherwise required by law, written notice of any meeting shall be given
not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the
meeting to each stockholder entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting.

 



C-2-6 Section 5\. _Adjournments_. Any meeting of the stockholders may be adjourned
from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice
need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any,
thereof and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders
and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such
adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record
date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting in
accordance with the requirements of Section 4 hereof shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting.

Section 6\. _Quorum_. Unless otherwise required by applicable law or the
Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of a majority of the Corporations
capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in
person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of
the stockholders for the transaction of business. A quorum, once established,
shall not be broken by the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a
quorum. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any
meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat,
present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the
meeting from time to time, in the manner provided in Section 5 hereof, until a
quorum shall be present or represented.

 



C-2-7 Section 7\. _Voting_. Unless otherwise required by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, or permitted by the rules of any stock
exchange on which the Corporations shares are listed and traded, any question
brought before any meeting of the stockholders, other than the election of
directors, shall be decided by the vote of the holders of a majority of the
total number of votes of the Corporations capital stock represented at the
meeting and entitled to vote on such question, voting as a single class.
Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, and subject to
Section 11(a) of this Article II, each stockholder represented at a meeting of
the stockholders shall be entitled to cast one (1) vote for each share of the
capital stock entitled to vote thereat held by such stockholder. Such votes
may be cast in person or by proxy as provided in Section 8 of this Article II.
The Board of Directors, in its discretion, or the officer of the Corporation
presiding at a meeting of the stockholders, in such officers discretion, may
require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.

Section 8.  _Proxies_. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of the
stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder as proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted upon after three years
from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. Without
limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or
persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, the following shall constitute
a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority:

(i) A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons
to act for such stockholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the
stockholder or such stockholders authorized officer, director, employee or
agent signing such writing or causing such persons signature to be affixed
to such writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by
facsimile signature.

 



C-2-8 (ii) A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for
such stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of
a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the person
who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy
support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who
will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that
any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must
either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be
determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was
authorized by the stockholder. If it is determined that such telegrams,
cablegrams or other electronic transmissions are valid, the inspectors or, if
there are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall
specify the information on which they relied.

Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the
writing or transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy
for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing
or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or
transmission could be used; provided, however, that such copy, facsimile
telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of
the entire original writing or transmission.

 



C-2-9 Section 9\. _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_. Unless otherwise
provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or
permitted to be taken at any Annual or Special Meeting of Stockholders of the
Corporation may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a
vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken,
shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present
and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its
registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business,
or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of the stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the
Corporations registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested. Every written consent shall bear the date
of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent
shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless,
within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered in the manner
required by this Section 9 to the Corporation, written consents signed by a
sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered to the Corporation
by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal
place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody
of the book in which proceedings of meetings of the stockholders are recorded.
A telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission consenting to an action
to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person
or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed
to be written, signed and dated for the purposes of this Section 9, provided
that any such telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission sets forth
or is delivered with information from which the Corporation can determine (i)
that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was transmitted
by the stockholder or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act
for the stockholder or proxyholder and (ii) the date on which such stockholder
or proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such telegram,
cablegram or electronic transmission. The date on which such telegram,
cablegram or electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the
date on which such consent was signed. No consent given by telegram, cablegram
or other electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until
such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be
delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State
of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the
Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
the stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporations registered
office shall be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested. Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a
consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing
for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used,
provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing. Prompt notice of the taking of
the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent
shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and
who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to
notice of the meeting if the record date for such meeting had been the date
that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the
action were delivered to the Corporation as provided above in this Section
9\.

 



C-2-10 Section 10\. _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The officer of the
Corporation who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall
prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of the
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder,
for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for
a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting (i) on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain
access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii)
during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the
Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list
available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps
to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the
Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be
produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time
thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the
meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list
shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time
of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the
information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of
the meeting.

 



C-2-11 Section 11\. _Record Date_.

 

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of the stockholders or any adjournment
thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more
than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting.
If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the
stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the
day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A
determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of the stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for
the adjourned meeting.

 



C-2-12 (b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than ten (10) days after
the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board of Directors. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of
Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent
to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the
Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on
which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to
be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office
in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or
agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of
meetings of the stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporations
registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors
and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior
action.

Section 12\. _Stock Ledger_. The stock ledger of the Corporation shall be the
only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock
ledger, the list required by Section 10 of this Article II or the books of the
Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of the
stockholders.

 



C-2-13 Section 13\. _Conduct of Meetings_. The Board of Directors of the Corporation
may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of any
meeting of the stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent
inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of
Directors, the chairman of any meeting of the stockholders shall have the
right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to
do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the
proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether
adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the
meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment
of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) the determination of
when the polls shall open and close for any given matter to be voted on at the
meeting; (iii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and
the safety of those present; (iv) limitations on attendance at or
participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation,
their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the
chairman of the meeting shall determine; (v) restrictions on entry to
the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (vi)
limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants.

_DIRECTORS _

Section 1\. _Number and Election of Directors_. The Board of Directors shall
consist of not less than one nor more than fifteen members, the exact number
of which shall initially be fixed by the Incorporator and thereafter from time
to time by the Board of Directors. Except as provided in Section 2 of this
Article III, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at
each Annual Meeting of Stockholders and each director so elected shall hold

of Incorporation, vacancies on the Board of Directors or any committee
thereof arising through death, resignation, removal, an increase in the number
of directors constituting the Board of Directors or such committee or
otherwise may be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office,
though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. The directors so
chosen shall, in the case of the Board of Directors, hold office until the
next annual election and until their successors are duly elected and
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal and, in the
case of any committee of the Board of Directors, shall hold office until their

their earlier death, resignation or removal.

Section 3\. _Duties and Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors which
may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts
and things as are not by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by
these Bylaws required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.

 



C-2-15 Section 4\. _Meetings_. The Board of Directors and any committee thereof may
hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State
of Delaware. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors or any committee
thereof may be held without notice at such time and at such place as may from
time to time be determined by the Board of Directors or such committee,
respectively. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the
Chairman, if there be one, the President, or by any director. Special meetings
of any committee of the Board of Directors may be called by the chairman of
such committee, if there be one, the President, or any director serving on
such committee. Notice thereof stating the place, date and hour of the meeting
shall be given to each director (or, in the case of a committee, to each
member of such committee) either by mail not less than forty-eight (48) hours
before the date of the meeting, by telephone, telegram or electronic means on
twenty-four (24) hours notice, or on such shorter notice as the person or
persons calling such meeting may deem necessary or appropriate in the
circumstances.

Section 5\. _Organization_. At each meeting of the Board of Directors or any
committee thereof, the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the chairman of
such committee, as the case may be, or, in his or her absence or if there be
none, a director chosen by a majority of the directors present, shall act as
chairman. Except as provided below, the Secretary of the Corporation shall act
as secretary at each meeting of the Board of Directors and of each committee
thereof. In case the Secretary shall be absent from any meeting of the Board
of Directors or of any committee thereof, an Assistant Secretary shall perform
the duties of secretary at such meeting; and in the absence from any such
meeting of the Secretary and all the Assistant Secretaries, the chairman
of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the members of each committee of the Board of
Directors may appoint any person to act as secretary of any meeting of such
committee and the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Corporation
may, but need not if such committee so elects, serve in such capacity.

 



C-2-16 Section 6\. _Resignations and Removals of Directors_. Any director of the
Corporation may resign from the Board of Directors or any committee thereof
at any time, by giving notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the
Chairman of the Board of Directors, if there be one, the President or the
Secretary of the Corporation and, in the case of a committee, to the chairman
of such committee, if there be one. Such resignation shall take effect at the
time therein specified or, if no time is specified, immediately; and, unless
otherwise specified in such notice, the acceptance of such resignation shall
not be necessary to make it effective. Except as otherwise required by
applicable law and subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of
preferred stock then outstanding, any director or the entire Board
of Directors may be removed from office at any time, by the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least a majority in voting power of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election
of directors. Any director serving on a committee of the Board of Directors
may be removed from such committee at any time by the Board of Directors.

for trading, at all meetings of the Board of Directors or any committee
thereof, a majority of the entire Board of Directors or a majority of
the directors constituting such committee, as the case may be, shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority
of the directors or committee members present at any meeting at which there is
a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors or such committee, as
applicable. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof, the directors present thereat may adjourn
the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the
meeting of the time and place of the adjourned meeting, until a quorum shall
be present.

 



C-2-17 Section 8\. _Actions of the Board by Written Consent_. Unless otherwise
provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action
required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or
of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all the members of
the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto
in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or
electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of
proceedings of the Board of Directors or such committee. Such filing shall be

participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or such committee by means
of a conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of
which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and
participation in a meeting pursuant to this Section 9 shall constitute
presence in person at such meeting.

 



C-2-18 Section 10\. _Committees_. The Board of Directors may designate one or more
committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the
Corporation. Each member of a committee must meet the requirements for
membership, if any, imposed by applicable law and the rules and regulations of
any securities exchange or quotation system on which the securities of the
Corporation are listed or quoted for trading. The Board of Directors may
designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may
replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of any such
committee. Subject to the rules and regulations of any securities exchange or
quotation system on which the securities of the Corporation are listed or
quoted for trading, in the absence or disqualification of a member of
a committee, and in the absence of a designation by the Board of Directors of
an alternate member to replace the absent or disqualified member, the member
or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting,
whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously
appoint another qualified member of the Board of Directors to act at the
meeting in the place of any absent or disqualified member. Any committee, to
the extent permitted by law and provided in the resolution establishing such
committee, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the
Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the
Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to
all papers which may require it. Each committee shall keep regular minutes and
report to the Board of Directors when required. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Article III, the resolution of the Board
of Directors establishing any committee of the Board of Directors and/or the
charter of any such committee may establish requirements or procedures
relating to the governance and/or operation of such committee that are
different from, or in addition to, those set forth in these Bylaws and, to
the extent that there is any inconsistency between these Bylaws and any such
resolution or charter, the terms of such resolution or charter shall be
controlling.

 

Section 11\. _Compensation_. The directors may be paid their expenses, if any,
of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a
fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or a stated
salary for service as director, payable in cash or securities. No such payment
shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other
capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing
committees may be allowed like compensation for service as committee members.

 



C-2-19 Section 12\. _Interested Directors_. No contract or transaction between the
Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the
Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or other
organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors
or officers or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely
for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or
participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof
which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because any such
directors or officers vote is counted for such purpose if: (i) the material
facts as to the directors or officers relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors
or the committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith
authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority
of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be
less than a quorum; or (ii) the material facts as to the directors or
officers relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are
disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and
the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of
the stockholders; or (iii) the contract or transaction is fair as to the
Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified by the Board
of Directors, a committee thereof or the stockholders. Common or interested
directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting
of the Board of Directors or of a committee which authorizes the contract or
transaction.

preside at all meetings of the stockholders and, provided the President is
also a director, the Board of Directors. If there be no Chairman of the Board
of Directors, or if the Board of Directors shall otherwise designate, the

Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the President,
under whose supervision the Secretary shall be. If the Secretary shall be
unable or shall refuse to cause to be given notice of all meetings of the
stockholders and special meetings of the Board of Directors, and if there be
no Assistant Secretary, then either the Board of Directors or the President
may choose another officer to cause such notice to be given. The Secretary

Assistant Secretary, if there be one, shall have authority to affix the same
to any instrument requiring it and when so affixed, it may be attested by the
signature of the Secretary or by the signature of any such Assistant
Secretary. The Board of Directors may give general authority to any other
officer to affix the seal of the Corporation and to attest to the affixing by
such officers signature. The Secretary shall see that all books, reports,
statements, certificates and other documents and records required by law to
be kept or filed are properly kept or filed, as the case may be.

Section 8\. _Treasurer_. The Treasurer shall have the custody of the
corporate funds and securities and shall keep full and accurate accounts of
receipts and disbursements in books belonging to the Corporation and shall
deposit all moneys and other valuable effects in the name and to the credit
of the Corporation in such depositories as may be designated by the Board of
Directors. The Treasurer shall disburse the funds of the Corporation as may be
ordered by the Board of Directors, taking proper vouchers for such
disbursements, and shall render to the President and the Board of Directors,
at its regular meetings, or when the Board of Directors so requires, an
account of all transactions as Treasurer and of the financial condition of the
Corporation. If required by the Board of Directors, the Treasurer shall give
the Corporation a bond in such sum and with such surety or sureties as shall
be satisfactory to the Board of Directors for the faithful performance of the
duties of the office of the Treasurer and for the restoration to the
Corporation, in case of the Treasurers death, resignation, retirement or
removal from office, of all books, papers, vouchers, money and other property
of whatever kind in the Treasurers possession or under the Treasurers
control belonging to the Corporation.

 



C-2-24 Section 9\. _Assistant Secretaries_. Assistant Secretaries, if there be any,
shall perform such duties and have such powers as from time to time may be
assigned to them by the Board of Directors, the President, any Vice President,
if there be one, or the Secretary, and in the absence of the Secretary or in
the event of the Secretarys inability or refusal to act, shall perform the
duties of the Secretary, and when so acting, shall have all the powers of and
be subject to all the restrictions upon the Secretary.

 

Section 10\. _Assistant Treasurers_. Assistant Treasurers, if there be any,
shall perform such duties and have such powers as from time to time may be
assigned to them by the Board of Directors, the President, any Vice President,
if there be one, or the Treasurer, and in the absence of the Treasurer or in
the event of the Treasurers inability or refusal to act, shall perform the
duties of the Treasurer, and when so acting, shall have all the powers of and
be subject to all the restrictions upon the Treasurer. If required by the
Board of Directors, an Assistant Treasurer shall give the Corporation a bond
in such sum and with such surety or sureties as shall be satisfactory to the
Board of Directors for the faithful performance of the duties of the office of
Assistant Treasurer and for the restoration to the Corporation, in case of the
Assistant Treasurers death, resignation, retirement or removal from office,
of all books, papers, vouchers, money and other property of whatever kind in
the Assistant Treasurers possession or under the Assistant Treasurers
control belonging to the Corporation.

 



C-2-25 Section 11\. _Other Officers_. Such other officers as the Board of Directors
may choose shall perform such duties and have such powers as from time to
time may be assigned to them by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors
may delegate to any other officer of the Corporation the power to choose such
other officers and to prescribe their respective duties and powers.

 _STOCK_

Section 1.  _Form of Certificates_. Every holder of stock in the Corporation
shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the
Corporation (i) by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the President or
a Vice President and (ii) by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, certifying the number
of shares owned by such stockholder in the Corporation.

 

Section 2\. _Signatures_. Any or all of the signatures on a certificate may be
a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed
or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have
ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate
is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if
such person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of
issue.

Section 3\. _Lost Certificates_. The Board of Directors may direct a new
certificate to be issued in place of any certificate theretofore issued by the
Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to
be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new
certificate, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate, or such owners legal representative, to advertise
the same in such manner as the Board of Directors shall require and/or to give
the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged
loss, theft or destruction of such certificate or the issuance of such new
certificate.

 



C-2-26 Section 4\. _Transfers_. Stock of the Corporation shall be transferable in the
manner prescribed by applicable law and in these Bylaws. Transfers of stock
shall be made on the books of the Corporation only by the person named in the
certificate or by such persons attorney lawfully constituted in writing and
upon the surrender of the certificate therefor, properly endorsed for
transfer and payment of all necessary transfer taxes; provided, however, that
such surrender and endorsement or payment of taxes shall not be required in
any case in which the officers of the Corporation shall determine to waive
such requirement. Every certificate exchanged, returned or surrendered to the
Corporation shall be marked "Cancelled," with the date of cancellation, by the
Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Corporation or the transfer agent
thereof. No transfer of stock shall be valid as against the Corporation for
any purpose until it shall have been entered in the stock records of the
Corporation by an entry showing from and to whom transferred.

 

Section 5\. _Dividend Record Date_. In order that the Corporation may
determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or
other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to
exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock,
or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix
a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be
not more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no record date is
fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose
shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors
adopts the resolution relating thereto.

 



C-2-27 Section 6\. _Record Owners_. The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize
the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of
shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for
calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares,
and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or
interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or
not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise
required by law.

 

Section 7\. _Transfer and Registry Agents_. The Corporation may from time to
time maintain one or more transfer offices or agencies and registry offices
or agencies at such place or places as may be determined from time to time by
the Board of Directors.

 



C-2-28 ARTICLE VI

 

 _NOTICES_

Section 1.  _Notices_. Whenever written notice is required by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, to be given to any director,
member of a committee or stockholder, such notice may be given by mail,
addressed to such director, member of a committee or stockholder, at such
persons address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, with postage
thereon prepaid, and such notice shall be deemed to be given at the time when
the same shall be deposited in the United States mail. Without limiting the
manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any
notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a
form of electronic transmission if consented to by the stockholder to whom the
notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by
written notice to the Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed to be
revoked if (i) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic
transmission two (2) consecutive notices by the Corporation in accordance with
such consent and (ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or
Assistant Secretary of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other
person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, that the
inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not
invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given by electronic
transmission, as described above, shall be deemed given: (i) if by facsimile
telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has
consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to
an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive
notice; (iii) if by a posting on an electronic network, together with separate
notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such
posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and (iv) if by any other
form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. Notice to
directors or committee members may be given personally or by telegram, telex,
cable or by means of electronic transmission.

Section 2\. _Waivers of Notice_. Whenever any notice is required by applicable
law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, to be given to any
director, member of a committee or stockholder, a waiver thereof in writing,
signed by the person or persons entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic
transmission by the person or persons entitled to notice, whether before or
after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto. Attendance
of a person at a meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where the person
attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of
the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at,
nor the purpose of, any Annual or Special Meeting of Stockholders or any
regular or special meeting of the directors or members of a committee of
directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required
by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

 



C-2-29 ARTICLE VII

 

 _GENERAL PROVISIONS_

 

Section 1\. _Dividends_. Dividends upon the capital stock of the Corporation,
subject to the requirements of the DGCL and the provisions of the Certificate
of Incorporation, if any, may be declared by the Board of Directors at any
regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors (or any action by written
consent in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 8 of Article III hereof),
and may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the Corporations
capital stock. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of
any funds of the Corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the
Board of Directors from time to time, in its absolute discretion, deems proper
as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for purchasing any of the
shares of capital stock, warrants, rights, options, bonds, debentures, notes,
scrip or other securities or evidences of indebtedness of the Corporation, or
for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the
Corporation, or for any proper purpose, and the Board of Directors may modify
or abolish any such reserve.

Section 2\. _Disbursements_. All checks or demands for money and notes of the
Corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers or such other person
or persons as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate.

Section 3\. _Fiscal Year_. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be fixed
by resolution of the Board of Directors.

 



C-2-30 Section 4\. _Corporate Seal_. The corporate seal shall have inscribed thereon
the name of the Corporation, the year of its organization and the words
"Corporate Seal, Delaware". The seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile
thereof to be impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise.

 

ARTICLE VIII

_INDEMNIFICATION _

Section 1\. _Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers_. The
Corporation shall indemnify its directors and executive officers to the
fullest extent not prohibited by the Delaware General Corporation Law;
provided, however, that (a) the Corporation may limit the extent of such
indemnification by individual contracts with its directors and
executive officers; (b) the Corporation shall not be required to indemnify
any director that has not signed the Corporations standard form of director
confidentiality agreement or for any damages resulting from a breach of such
agreement as the result of the gross negligence, recklessness or willful
misconduct of the director, unless such breach is caused by actions reasonably
believed by the Director, based on advice of competent counsel, to be
consistent with the fiduciary duties owed by such Director to the Company and
its stockholders; and (c) the Corporation shall not be required to indemnify
any director or executive officer in connection with any proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person or any proceeding by such person against
the Corporation or its directors, officers, employees or other agents unless
(i) such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (ii) the
proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, and
(iii) such indemnification is provided by the corporation, in its sole
discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the corporation under the
Delaware General Corporation Law.

 



C-2-31 Section 2\. _Indemnification of Other Officers, Employees and Other Agents_.
The corporation shall have power to indemnify its other officers, employees
and other agents as set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 

Section 3\. _Good Faith_.

 

(a) For purposes of any determination under this Bylaw, a director or officer
shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation,
and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no
reasonable cause to believe that any conduct was unlawful, if such directors
or officers action is based on information, opinions, reports and
statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each
case prepared or presented by:

 

(i) one or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the director or
executive officer believed to be reliable and competent in the matters
presented;

(ii) counsel, independent accountants or other persons as to matters which
the director or executive officer believed to be within such persons
professional competence; and

(iii) with respect to a director, a committee of the Board upon which such
director does not serve, as to matters within such Committees designated
authority, which committee the director believes to merit confidence; so long
as, in each case, the director or executive officer acts without knowledge
that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted.

 



C-2-32 (b) The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of
itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in
a manner which was reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal proceeding,
that the person had reasonable cause to believe that his or her consent was
unlawful.

(c) The provisions of this Section 3 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or
to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have
met the applicable standard of conduct set forth by the Delaware General
Corporation Law.

 

Section 4\. _Expenses_. The corporation shall advance, prior to the final
disposition of any proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all
expenses actually and reasonably incurred by any director or officer in
connection with such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf
of such person to repay said amounts if it should be determined ultimately
that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or
otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant
to Section 4 of this Bylaw, no advance shall be made by the corporation if a
determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Board of Directors
by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to
the proceeding, or (ii) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if
obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent
legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-
making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and
convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such
person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation.

 



C-2-33 Section 5\. _Enforcement_. Without the necessity of entering into an express
contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and
officers under this Bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be
effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the
corporation and the director or officer. Any right to indemnification or
advances granted by this Bylaw to a director or officer shall be enforceable
by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of competent
jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in
whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made within ninety
(90) days of request therefor. The claimant in such enforcement action, if
successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense
of prosecuting his or her claim. The corporation shall be entitled to raise as
a defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of
conduct that make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation
Law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed.
Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant
is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an
actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel or its stock-holders) that the claimant has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct.

Section 6\. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person by
this Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may
have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended from time to time, Bylaws, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in
his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding
office. The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual
contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents
respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited
by the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 



C-2-34 Section 7\. _Survival of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person by this
Bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors
and administrators of such a person.

 

Section 8\. _Insurance_. To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware
General Corporation Law, the corporation, upon approval by the Board of
Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or
permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Bylaw.

 

Section 9\. _Amendments_. Any repeal or modification of this Bylaw shall only
be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Bylaw in effect at
the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is
the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the corporation.

 

Section 10\. _Saving Clause_. If this Bylaw or any portion hereof shall be
invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and officer to the full
extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Bylaw that shall not
have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.

 

Section 11\. _Certain Definitions_. For the purposes of this Bylaw, the
following definitions shall apply.

 

(a) The term "proceeding" shall be broadly construed and shall include,
without limitation, the investigation, preparation, prosecution, defense,
settlement, arbitration and appeal of, and the giving of the testimony in, any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative.

 



C-2-35 (b) The term "expenses" shall be broadly construed and shall include,
without limitation, court costs, attorneys fees, witness fees, fines,
amounts paid in settlement or judgment and any other costs and expenses of any
nature or kind incurred in connection with any proceeding.

 

(c) The term the "corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was
a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is
or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the
provisions of this Bylaw with respect to the resulting or surviving
corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if
its separate existence had continued.

 

(d) References to a "director," "officer," "employee," or "agent" of the
corporation shall include, without limitation, situations where such person
is serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee,
trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise.

 

(e) References to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans;
references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person
with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the
request of the corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves
services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an
employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who
acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the
interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan
shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests
of the corporation" as referred to in this Bylaw.

All such amendments must be approved by either the holders of a majority of
the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote thereon or by a majority of the

and terms of redemption (including sinking fund provisions, if any), the
redemption price or prices, the liquidation preferences, any other
designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other
special rights, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof,
of any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock, and the number of shares
constituting any such unissued series and the designation thereof, or any of
them; and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series
subsequent to the issue of shares of that series, but not below the number of
shares of such series then outstanding. In case the number of shares of any
series shall be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall
resume the status which they had prior to the adoption of the resolution
originally fixing the number of shares of such series.

 

V.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the
Board of Directors of the Corporation is expressly authorized to make, alter
or repeal Bylaws of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Bylaws
of the Corporation may be rescinded, altered, amended or repealed in any
respect by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662/3% of the
outstanding voting stock of the Corporation, voting together as a single

number of directors or any vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from
death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other
cause may be filled only by a majority vote of the directors then in office
even though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and not by
the stockholders. In the event of a vacancy in the Board of Directors, the
remaining directors, except as otherwise provided by law, may exercise the
powers of the full Board of Directors until the vacancy is filled.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each director shall serve until his or her
successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her death, resignation
or removal. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of
Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.

Board of Directors which has been duly designated by the Board of Directors
and whose powers and authority, as provided in a resolution of the Board of
Directors or in the Bylaws, include the power to call such meetings, but such
special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons.

IX.

 

To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as
the same exists or as may hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation
shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.

 

The Corporation may indemnify and advance indemnification expenses to the
fullest extent permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a
party to an action or proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or
investigative, by reason of the fact that he, his testator or intestate is or
was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation or any predecessor of
the Corporation, or serves or served at any other enterprise as a director,
officer or employee at the request of the Corporation or any predecessor to
the Corporation. The Corporation may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any such director, officer or
employee against any liability which may be asserted against him or her and
may enter contracts providing for the indemnification of any such person to
the fullest extent permitted by law.

 



D-1-4 Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article IX, nor the adoption of any
provision of this Corporations Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the
bylaws of the Corporation inconsistent with this Article IX, shall eliminate
or reduce the effect of this Article IX in respect of any matter occurring, or
any action or proceeding accruing or arising or that, but for this Article
IX, would accrue or arise, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an
inconsistent provision.

to be timely must be so delivered, or mailed and received, not later than the
90th day prior to such annual meeting or, if later, the tenth day following
the day on which public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting was
first made; _provided, further_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, for the
2013 Annual Meeting of stockholders of the corporation (the " _2013 Annual
Meeting_ "), a notice by a stockholder delivered to, or mailed and received
at, the principal executive offices of the corporation on or prior to February
15, 2013 shall in all circumstances be deemed timely notwithstanding the date
of the 2013 Annual Meeting or the date of the public disclosure thereof. Any
such notice that is delivered to, or mailed and received at, the principal
executive offices of the corporation within any of the time periods set forth
in the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed an " _Annual Meeting
Timely Notice_." In no event shall any adjournment of an annual meeting or the
announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of Annual
Meeting Timely Notice as described above.

 



D-2-5 (ii) _Timely Notice of Nominations for Special Meeting_. To be timely, a
stockholders notice of nominations to be made at a special meeting at which
the election of directors is a matter specified in the notice of meeting must
be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the principal executive offices of
the corporation not earlier than the 120th day prior to such special meeting
and not later than the 90th day prior to such special meeting or, if later,
the tenth day following the day on which public disclosure (as defined in
this Section 2.5) of the date of such special meeting was first made (such
notice within such time periods, _"Special Meeting Timely Notice"_ ). In no
event shall any adjournment of a special meeting or the announcement thereof
commence a new time period for the giving of Special Meeting Timely Notice as
described above.

 

(c) _Definition of Public Disclosure_. For purposes of these bylaws, _"public
disclosure"_ shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by a national
news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the
Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14 or 15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
thereunder (as so amended and inclusive of such rules and regulations, the
_"Exchange Act"_ ).

the secretary shall set forth:

below), (A) the name and address of such Nominating Person (including, if
applicable, the name and address that appear on the corporations books and
records); and (B) the class or series and number of shares of the corporation
that are, directly or indirectly, owned of record or beneficially owned
(within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) by each Nominating
Person, except that a Nominating Person shall in all events be deemed to
beneficially own any shares of any class or series of the corporation as to
which such Nominating Person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership at
any time in the future (the disclosures to be made pursuant to the foregoing
clauses (A) and (B) are referred to as _"Stockholder Information"_ );

 



D-2-6 (ii) _Information About Disclosable Interests_. As to each Nominating Person,
(A) any derivative, swap or other transaction or series of transactions
engaged in, directly or indirectly, by such Nominating Person, the purpose or
effect of which is to give such Nominating Person economic risk similar to
ownership of shares of any class or series of the corporation, including due
to the fact that the value of such derivative, swap or other transactions are
determined by reference to the price, value or volatility of any shares of any
class or series of the corporation, or which derivative, swap or other
transactions provide, directly or indirectly, the opportunity to profit from
any increase in the price or value of shares of any class or series of the
corporation ( _"Synthetic Equity Interests"_ ), which Synthetic Equity
Interests shall be disclosed without regard to whether (x) the derivative,
swap or other transactions convey any voting rights in such shares to such
Nominating Person, (y) the derivative, swap or other transactions
are required to be, or are capable of being, settled through delivery of such
shares or (z) such Nominating Person may have entered into other transactions
that hedge or mitigate the economic effect of such derivative, swap or other
transactions, (B) any proxy (other than a revocable proxy or consent given in
response to a solicitation made pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section
14(a) of the Exchange Act by way of a solicitation statement filed on Schedule
14A), agreement, arrangement, understanding or relationship pursuant to which
such Nominating Person has or shares a right to vote any shares of any class
or series of the corporation, (C) any agreement, arrangement, understanding or
relationship, including any repurchase or similar so-called "stock borrowing"
agreement or arrangement, engaged in, directly or indirectly, by such
Nominating Person, the purpose or effect of which is to mitigate loss to,
reduce the economic risk (of ownership or otherwise) of shares of any class
or series of the corporation by, manage the risk of share price changes for,
or increase or decrease the voting power of, such Nominating Person with
respect to the shares of any class or series of the corporation, or which
provides, directly or indirectly, the opportunity to profit from any decrease
in the price or value of the shares of any class or series of the corporation
( _"Short Interests"_ ), (D) any rights to dividends on the shares of any
class or series of the corporation owned beneficially by such Nominating
Person that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the
corporation, (E) any performance related fees (other than an asset based fee)
that such Nominating Person is entitled to based on any increase or decrease
in the price or value of shares of any class or series of the corporation, or
any Synthetic Equity Interests or Short Interests, if any, and (F) any other
information relating to such Nominating Person that would be required to be
disclosed in a proxy statement or other filing required to be made in
connection with solicitations of proxies or consents by such Nominating Person
in support of the election of directors at the meeting pursuant to Section
14(a) of the Exchange Act (the disclosures to be made pursuant to the
foregoing clauses (A) through (F) are referred to as _"Disclosable Interests"_
); _provided_ , _however_ , that Disclosable Interests shall not include any
such disclosures with respect to the ordinary course business activities of
any broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee who is a
Nominating Person solely as a result of being the stockholder directed to
prepare and submit the notice required by these bylaws on behalf of a
beneficial owner; and

(iii)  _Information About Nominees_. As to each person whom a Nominating
Person proposes to nominate for election as a director, (A) all information

being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director
if elected), (C) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and
other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the
past three years, and any other material relationships, between or among any
Nominating Person, on the one hand, and each proposed nominee and his or her
respective affiliates and associates, on the other hand, including, without
limitation, all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant
to Item 404 under Regulation S-K if such Nominating Person were the
"registrant" for purposes of such rule and the proposed nominee were a

pursuant to the foregoing clauses (A) through (C) are referred to as _"Nominee
Information"_ ).

term  _"Nominating Person"_ shall mean (i) the stockholder providing the
notice of the nomination proposed to be made at the meeting, (ii) the

notice of the nomination proposed to be made at the meeting is made and (iii)
any affiliate or associate (each within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the
Exchange Act for purposes of these bylaws) of such stockholder or beneficial
owner.

 

(f) _Other Information to be Furnished by Proposed Nominees_. The corporation
may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information (A) as may
reasonably be required by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such
proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the corporation in
accordance with the corporations Corporate Governance Guidelines or (B) that
could be material to a reasonable stockholders understanding of the
independence or lack of independence of such proposed nominee.

 

(g) _Updates and Supplements_. A stockholder providing notice of any
nomination proposed to be made at a meeting shall further update

is ten business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof, and such update and supplement shall be delivered to or mailed and
received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the
corporation not later than five business days after the record date for the
meeting (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of
the record date), and not later than eight business days prior to the date for
the meeting or (if practicable or, if not practicable, on the first
practicable date prior to) any adjournment or postponement thereof (in the
case of the update and supplement required to be made as of ten business days
prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof).

 

(h) _Defective Nominations_. No person shall be eligible for election as a

the bylaws, and if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare
to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.

 

(i) _Compliance with Exchange Act_. In addition to the requirements of this
Section 2.5 with respect to any nomination proposed to be made at a meeting,

supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the board of directors,
(ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of
the board of directors, or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the

of the corporation) both at the time of giving the notice provided for in
this Section 2.6 and at the time of the meeting, (B) is entitled to vote at
the meeting, and (C) has complied with this Section 2.6 as to such business.
Except for proposals properly made in accordance with Rule 14a-8 under the
Exchange Act and included in the notice of meeting given by or at the

qualification, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting
by a stockholder, the stockholder must (i) provide Annual Meeting Timely

(ii) _Information About Disclosable Interests_. As to each Proposing
Person, any Disclosable Interests (as defined in Section 2.5(d)(ii), except
that for purposes of this Section 2.6 the term "Proposing Person" shall be
substituted for the term "Nominating Person" in all places as it appears
in Section 2.5(d)(ii) and the disclosures shall be made with respect to the
proposal of business to be brought before the meeting rather than to the
nomination of directors to be elected at the meeting); and

 

(iii) _Description of Proposed Business_. As to each item of business that the
stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting, (A) a reasonably
brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual
meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting and
any material interest in such business of each Proposing Person, (B) the text
of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed
for consideration), and (C) a reasonably detailed description of all
agreements, arrangements and understandings (x) between or among any of the
Proposing Persons or (y) between or among any Proposing Person and any other
record or beneficial holder of the shares of any class or series of the
corporation (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such
business by such stockholder. 

(d) _Definition of Proposing Person_. For purposes of this Section 2.6, the
term _"Proposing Person"_ shall mean (i) the stockholder providing the notice
of business proposed to be brought before an annual meeting, (ii) the
beneficial owner or beneficial owners, if different, on whose behalf the
notice of the business proposed to be brought before the annual meeting is
made and (iii) any affiliate or associate of such stockholder or beneficial
owner.

 



D-2-9 (e) _Updates and Supplements_. A stockholder providing notice of business
proposed to be brought before an annual meeting shall further update and
supplement such notice, if necessary, so that the information provided or
required to be provided in such notice pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be
true and correct as of the record date for the meeting and as of the date
that is ten business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, and such update and supplement shall be delivered to, or
mailed and received by, the secretary at the principal executive offices of
the corporation not later than five business days after the record date for
the meeting (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as
of the record date), and not later than eight business days prior to the date
for the meeting or (if practicable or, if not practicable, on the first
practicable date prior to) any adjournment or postponement thereof (in the
case of the update and supplement required to be made as of ten business days
prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof).

(f) _Business Not Properly Brought Before a Meeting_. Notwithstanding
anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at
any annual meeting except in accordance with this Section 2.6. The chairman of
the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the
meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.6, and if he or she should so
determine, he or she so shall so declare at the meeting that any business not
properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.

(g) _Rule 14a-8; Exchange Act Compliance_. This Section 2.6 is expressly
intended to apply to any business proposed to be brought before an annual
meeting of stockholders other than any proposal made pursuant to Rule 14a-8
under the Exchange Act. In addition to the requirements of this Section 2.6
with respect to any business proposed to be brought before an annual meeting,
each Proposing Person shall comply with all applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act with respect to any such business. Nothing in this Section 2.6
shall be deemed to affect the rights of stockholders to request inclusion of
proposals in the corporations proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under
the Exchange Act.



   2.7 | _MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE_ 
---|--- 

Written notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the
stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation. An
affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent
of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of
fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.



   2.8 | _QUORUM_ 
---|--- 

The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled
to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute
a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business
except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of
incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any
meeting of the stockholders, then the stockholders entitled to vote thereat,
present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the
meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the
meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting
at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted
that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.

 



D-2-10 ---|--- 

When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these bylaws
otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the
time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment
is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business
that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is
fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.



   2.10 | _CONDUCT OF BUSINESS_ 
---|--- 

The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of
business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the
manner of voting and the conduct of business.



   2.11 | _VOTING_ 
---|--- 

The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall
be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.14 of these
bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (relating to voting rights of
fiduciaries, pledgers and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and
other voting agreements).

Except as provided in the last paragraph of this Section 2.11, or as may be
otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder shall
be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such
stockholder.

 



   2.12 | _WAIVER OF NOTICE_ 
---|--- 

Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or of the certificate of
incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person
entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be
deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends
a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the
meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the
purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be
specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by
the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.



   2.13 | _NO STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING_ 
---|--- 

Any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of
stockholders of the corporation, or any action that may be taken at any annual
or special meeting of such stockholders, must be taken at an annual or special
meeting of stockholders of the corporation, with prior notice and with a
vote, and may not be taken by a consent in writing.

 



D-2-11 ---|--- 

In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof
or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or
exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of
directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than 60
nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting, nor more than 60 days
prior to any other action.

 

If the board of directors does not so fix a record date:

 

(i) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the
day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived,
at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the
meeting is held.

 

(ii) The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall
be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts
the resolution relating thereto.

A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at
a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for
the adjourned meeting.



   2.15 | _PROXIES_ 
---|--- 

Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may
authorize another person or persons to act for him by (i) a written proxy,
signed by the stockholder and filed with the secretary of the corporation, or
(ii) transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or
other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder
of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service
organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the
holder of the proxy to receive such transmission in accordance with the
provisions of Section 212(c)(2) of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years
from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall
be deemed signed if the stockholders name is placed on the proxy (whether by
manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the
stockholder or the stockholders attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a
proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the
provisions of Section 212(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware.

 

ARTICLE III.

 

 _DIRECTORS_



   3.1 | _POWERS_ 
---|--- 

Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware and any limitations in the certificate of incorporation or these
bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by
the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be
managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by-or under the direction
of the board of directors.

 



D-2-12 ---|--- 

Until changed by a proper amendment to this Section 3.2, the authorized
number of directors shall be seven (7).

No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of
removing any director before that directors term of office expires.



   3.3 | _ELECTION, QUALIFICATION AND TERM OF OFFICE OF DIRECTORS_ 
---|--- 

Directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of the stockholders or
special meeting in lieu thereof, and shall serve until their successors are
duly elected and qualified. Directors need not be stockholders unless so
required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, wherein other
qualifications for directors may be prescribed.

Each director to be elected by the stockholders shall be elected by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to such director
by the shares represented and entitled to vote therefor at a meeting of the
stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present (an
"Election Meeting"); provided, however, that if the board of directors
determines that the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be
elected at such meeting (a "Contested Election"), whether or not the election
becomes an uncontested election after such determination, each of the
directors to be elected at the Election Meeting shall be elected by the
affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the shares represented
and entitled to vote at such meeting with respect to the election of such
director.

For purposes of this Section 3.3, a "majority of the votes cast" means that
the number of votes cast "for" a candidate for director exceeds the number of
votes cast "against" that director (with "abstentions" and "broker non-votes"
not counted as votes cast as either "for" or "against" such directors
election). In an election other than a Contested Election, stockholders will
be given the choice to cast votes "for" or "against" the election of directors
or to "abstain" from such vote and shall not have the ability to cast any
other vote with respect to such election of directors. In a Contested
Election, stockholders will be given the choice to cast "for" or "withhold"
votes for the election of directors and shall not have the ability to cast
any other vote with respect to such election of directors. In the event an
Election Meeting involves the election of directors by separate votes by class
or classes or series, the determination as to whether an election constitutes
a Contested Election shall be made on a class by class or series by series
basis, as applicable. The board of directors has established procedures under
which any director who is not elected shall offer to tender his or her
resignation to the board of directors.

Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized
number of directors or any vacancies in the board of directors resulting from
death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other
cause may be filled only by a majority vote of the directors then in office
even though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and not by
the stockholders. In the event of a vacancy in the board of directors, the
remaining directors, except as otherwise provided by law, may exercise the
powers of the full board of directors until the vacancy is filled.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each director shall serve until his or her
successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her death, resignation
or removal.

 



D-2-13 Elections of directors need not be by written ballot. There shall be no right
with respect to shares of stock of the corporation to cumulate votes in the
election of directors.



   3.4 | _PLACE OF MEETINGS; MEETINGS BY TELEPHONE_ 
---|--- 

The board of directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and
special, either within or outside the State of Delaware.

Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these
bylaws, members of the board of directors, or any committee designated by the
board of directors, may participate in a meeting of the board of directors, or
any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications
equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear
each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in
person at the meeting.

 



   3.5 | _REGULAR MEETINGS_ 
---|--- 

Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice at such
time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the board.



   3.6 | _SPECIAL MEETINGS; NOTICE_ 
---|--- 

Special meetings of the board for any purpose or purposes may be called at
any time by the chairman of the board, the president, the secretary or any two
directors.

Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be delivered
personally or by telephone to each director or sent by first-class mail or
telegram, charges prepaid, addressed to each director at that directors
address as it is shown on the records of the corporation. If the notice is
mailed, it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least four days
before the time of the holding of the meeting. If the notice is delivered
personally or by telephone or by telegram, it shall be delivered personally or
by telephone or to the telegraph company at least 24 hours before the time of
the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone
may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the
director who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly
communicate it to the director. The notice need not specify the purpose or the
place of the meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal executive
office of the corporation.

 



   3.7 | _QUORUM_ 
---|--- 

At all meetings of the board of directors, a majority of the authorized
number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business
and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which
there is a quorum shall be the act of the board of directors, except as may be
otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of
incorporation. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the board of
directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from
time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a
quorum is present.

 



D-2-14 A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact
business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is
approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting.



   3.8 | _WAIVER OF NOTICE_ 
---|--- 

Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or of the certificate of
incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person
entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be
deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends
a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the
meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the
purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the directors, or members of a
committee of directors, need be specified in any written waiver of notice
unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.



   3.9 | _BOARD ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING_ 
---|--- 

Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these
bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the
board of directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a
meeting if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent
thereto in writing and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of
proceedings of the board or committee. Written consents representing actions
taken by the board or committee may be executed by telex, telecopy or
other facsimile transmission, and such facsimile shall be valid and binding
to the same extent as if it were an original.



   3.10 | _FEES AND COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS_ 
---|--- 

Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these
bylaws, the board of directors shall have the authority to fix the
compensation of directors. No such compensation shall preclude any director
from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving
compensation therefor.



   3.11 | _REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS_ 
---|--- 

No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of
removing any director prior to the expiration of such directors term of
office.



   3.12 | _APPROVAL OF LOANS TO OFFICERS_ 
---|--- 

The corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any obligation of, or
otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the corporation or any
subsidiary, whenever, in the judgment of the directors, such loan, guaranty or
assistance may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation. The
loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be
unsecured, or secured in such manner as the board of directors shall approve,
including, without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the corporation.
Subject to the next sentence, nothing in this Section 3.12 shall be deemed to
deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation
at common law or under any statute. Notwithstanding anything in this Section
3.12 to the contrary, the corporation shall not, directly or indirectly,
including through any subsidiary, extend or maintain credit, arrange for the
extension of credit, or renew an extension of credit, in the form of a
personal loan to or for any director or executive officer in violation of
Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

 



D-2-15 ARTICLE IV.

 

 _COMMITTEES_



   4.1 | _COMMITTEES OF DIRECTORS_ 
---|--- 

The board of directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole
board, designate one or more committees, with each committee to consist of one
or more of the directors of the corporation. The board may designate one or
more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any
absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. Any such
committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board of directors
or in these bylaws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority
of the board of directors in the management of the business and affairs of
the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed
to all papers that may require it; but no such committee shall have the power
or authority to (i) amend the certificate of incorporation (except that a
committee may, to the extent authorized in the resolution or resolutions
providing for the issuance of shares of stock adopted by the board of
directors as provided in Section 151(a) of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware, fix any of the preferences or rights of such shares
relating to dividends, redemption, dissolution, any distribution of assets of
the corporation or the conversion into, or the exchange of such shares for,
shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the same or any
other class or classes of stock of the corporation), (ii) adopt an agreement
of merger or consolidation under Sections 251 or 252 of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, (iii) recommend to the stockholders
the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the corporations
property and assets, (iv) recommend to the stockholders a dissolution of the
corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, or (v) amend these bylaws; and,
unless the board resolution establishing the committee, these bylaws or the
certificate of incorporation expressly so provide, no such committee shall
have the power or authority to declare a dividend, to authorize the issuance
of stock or to adopt a certificate of ownership and merger pursuant to Section
253 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

 



   4.2 | _COMMITTEE MINUTES_

(Place of Meetings; Meetings by Telephone), Section 3.5 (Regular Meetings),
Section 3.6 (Special Meetings; Notice), Section 3.7 (Quorum), Section 3.8
(Waiver of Notice) and Section 3.9 (Board Action by Written Consent Without a
Meeting), with such changes in the context of those bylaws as are necessary to
substitute the committee and its members for the board of directors and its
members; provided, however, that the time of regular meetings of committees
may also be called by resolution of the board of directors and that notice of
special meetings of committees shall also be given to all alternate
members, who shall have the right to attend all meetings of the committee.
The board of directors may adopt rules for the government of any committee not
inconsistent with the provisions of these bylaws.

judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably
incurred in connection with any proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that
such person is or was an agent of the corporation. For purposes of this
Section 6.1, a "director" or "officer" of the corporation includes any person
(i) who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, (ii) who is or was
serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another

and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any
proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent
of the corporation. For purposes of this Section 6.2, an "employee"

---|--- 

Expenses incurred in defending any action or proceeding for which
indemnification is required pursuant to Section 6.1 or for which
indemnification is permitted pursuant to Section 6.2 following authorization

to be indemnified as authorized in this Article 6.

status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to
indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

No indemnification or advance shall be made under this Article 6,
except where such indemnification or advance is mandated by law or the order,
judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, in any circumstance
where it appears:

 

(i) that it would be inconsistent with a provision of the certificate of
incorporation, these bylaws, a resolution of the stockholders or an agreement
in effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of the action
asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other
amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limited indemnification; or

shares, held by each stockholder, a copy of these bylaws as amended to date,
accounting books and other records.

Any stockholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall,
upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the right
during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the
corporations stock ledger, a list of its stockholders and its other books and
records and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean
a purpose reasonably related to such persons interest as a stockholder. In
every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the
right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of
attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to
so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed
to the corporation at its registered office in Delaware or at its principal
place of business.

The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare
and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete
list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in
alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number
of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open
to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting,
during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the
meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held,
which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so
specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also
be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the
whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

 



D-2-21 ---|--- 

Any director shall have the right to examine the corporations stock ledger,
a list of its stockholders and its other books and records for a purpose
reasonably related to his position as a director. The Court of Chancery is
hereby vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a director
is entitled to the inspection sought. The Court may summarily order the
corporation to permit the director to inspect any and all books and records,
the stock ledger and the stock list and to make copies or extracts therefrom.
The Court may, in its discretion, prescribe any limitations or conditions
with reference to the inspection, or award such other and further relief as
the Court may deem just and proper.

special meeting of the stockholders when called for by vote of the
stockholders, a full and clear statement of the business and condition of the
corporation.

The chairman of the board, the president, any vice president, the secretary
or assistant secretary of this corporation, or any other person authorized by
the board of directors or the president or a vice president, is authorized to
vote, represent and exercise on behalf of this corporation all rights
incident to any and all shares of any other corporation or corporations
standing in the name of this corporation. The authority granted herein may be
exercised either by such person directly or by any other person authorized to

authority.

ARTICLE VIII.

 

 _GENERAL MATTERS_



   8.1 | _CHECKS_ 
---|--- 

From time to time, the board of directors shall determine by resolution
which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders
for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued
in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so
authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments.



   8.2 | _EXECUTION OF CORPORATE CONTRACTS AND INSTRUMENTS_ 
---|--- 

The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, may
authorize any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any
contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the
corporation; such authority may be general or confined to specific instances.
Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the
agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power
or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or
to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any
amount.

 



D-2-22 ---|--- 

The shares of a corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided
that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or
resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock
shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares
represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the
corporation. Every holder of stock represented by certificates shall be
entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by
the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, or the president or
vice-president, and by the secretary or an assistant secretary, or the
treasurer, if there be one, of such corporation representing the number of
shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the
certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or
registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a
certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before
such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same
effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date
of issue.



   8.4 | _SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES_ 
---|--- 

If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or
more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the
preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights
of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations
or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full
or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation
shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however,
that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may
be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall
issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the
corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests
the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating,
optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and
the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or
rights.



   8.5 | _LOST CERTIFICATES_ 
---|--- 

Except as provided in this Section 8.5, no new certificates for shares shall
be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is
surrendered to the corporation and canceled at the same time. The corporation
may issue a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in the place of
any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, and the corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give the corporation a
bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it
on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate
or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.

 



   8.6 | _CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS_ 
---|--- 

Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of
construction, and definitions in the Delaware General Corporation Law shall
govern the construction of these bylaws. Without limiting the generality of
this provision, the singular number includes the plural, the plural
number includes the singular, and the term "person" includes both a
corporation and a natural person.

 



D-2-23 ---|--- 

The directors of the corporation, subject to any restrictions contained
in the certificate of incorporation, may declare and pay dividends upon the
shares of its capital stock pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property or in shares of
the corporations capital stock.

The directors of the corporation may set apart out of any of the funds of the
corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper
purpose and may abolish any such reserve. Such purposes shall include but not
be limited to equalizing dividends, repairing or maintaining any property of
the corporation, and meeting contingencies.

 



   8.8 | _FISCAL YEAR_ 
---|--- 

The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the board
of directors and may be changed by the board of directors.



   8.9 | _SEAL_ 
---|--- 

The seal of the corporation, if any, shall be such as from time to time may
be approved by the board of directors.



   8.10 | _TRANSFER OF STOCK_ 
---|--- 

Upon surrender to the corporation or the transfer agent of the corporation of
a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of
succession, assignation or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the
corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto,
cancel the old certificate, and record the transaction in its books.



   8.11 | _STOCK TRANSFER AGREEMENTS_ 
---|--- 

The corporation shall have power to enter into and perform any agreement with
any number of stockholders of any one or more classes of stock of the
corporation to restrict the transfer of shares of stock of the corporation of
any one or more classes owned by such stockholders in any manner not
prohibited by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.



   8.12 | _REGISTERED STOCKHOLDERS_ 
---|--- 

The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a
person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and
to vote as such owner, shall be entitled to hold liable for calls and
assessments the person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and
shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest
in such share or shares on the part of another person, whether or not it shall
have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws
of Delaware.

 



D-2-24 ARTICLE IX.

 

 _AMENDMENTS_

The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or
repealed by the holders of not less than 66-2/3% of the shares then entitled
to vote at an election of directors; provided, however, that the corporation
may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or
repeal bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so
conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power,
nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.
