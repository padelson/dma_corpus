Statement, as modified to reflect such resolution, shall be the final Post-Closing Statement and shall be binding on all parties
for all purposes of this Agreement. If the Buyers and the Sellers are unable to resolve any disagreements regarding the Post-Closing
Statement and the calculations reflected thereon within the Negotiating Period, then within fifteen (15) days after the end of
the Negotiating Period all such disputes shall be promptly referred to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm other
than a &ldquo;Big 4&rdquo; firm as is mutually acceptable to the Buyers and the Sellers (the &ldquo;<U>Neutral Accounting Firm</U>&rdquo;).
The Neutral Accounting Firm shall be instructed only to resolve all outstanding disagreements relating to the Post-Closing Statement
and the calculation of Closing Working Capital, the amount of Closing Indebtedness and the Purchase Price reflected thereon, and
shall be instructed not to otherwise investigate such matters independently or introduce different judgments, accounting methods,
policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies in connection therewith (it being understood
that the amount of any reserves related to incurred but not reported claims and other reserves related to insurance accruals set
forth on <U>Schedule 1.4</U> shall be determined as of the Effective Time applying methods (including estimation methodologies),
practices and policies consistent with those used in determining the reserves or valuation accounts included in Parent&rsquo;s
audited financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2019), except to the extent inconsistent with GAAP. If the
Sellers and the Buyers are unable to agree upon an accounting firm to serve as the Neutral Accounting Firm within such fifteen
(15)-day period, then the Neutral Accounting Firm shall be an accountant employed by an accounting firm of national standing, other
than a &ldquo;Big 4&rdquo; firm, designated by the American Arbitration Association in New York, New York (which shall not be the
independent auditor of either the Buyers or the Sellers, Caesars or their respective Affiliates). The Neutral Accounting Firm shall
investigate only those items that the Sellers and the Buyers have been unable to resolve and shall not assign a value to any item
that is (A) greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either of the Buyers or the Sellers or (B) lower than the
lowest value for such item claimed by either of the Buyers or the Sellers. Each of the Sellers and the Buyers shall execute and
deliver a customary engagement letter as may be reasonably requested by the Neutral Accounting Firm. The Sellers and the Buyers
shall instruct the Neutral Accounting Firm that, within five (5)&nbsp;Business Days following its acceptance of its appointment
as the Neutral Accounting Firm, it shall deliver to the Sellers and the Buyers a written notice (the &ldquo;<U>Accountant Notice</U>&rdquo;)
setting forth (i)&nbsp;the deadline for the Sellers&rsquo; and the Buyers&rsquo; submission of the written presentations setting
forth their respective positions with respect to the disputed amounts (which deadline shall in all events be (A)&nbsp;the same
for the Sellers and the Buyers and (B)&nbsp;no sooner than thirty (30)&nbsp;days following the date of delivery of the Accountant
Notice (unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing among the Neutral Accounting Firm, the Sellers and the Buyers) and no later
than forty-five (45)&nbsp;days following the date of delivery of the Accountant Notice) and (ii)&nbsp;the format in which the Sellers
and the Buyers are to submit their written presentations (which format shall be reasonably acceptable to the Sellers and the Buyers).
A copy of all materials submitted to the Neutral Accounting Firm pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be provided
to the Neutral Accounting Firm by the Sellers and the Buyers, as applicable, no later than the deadline set forth in the Accountant
Notice (as the same may be amended by the mutual written consent of the Neutral Accounting Firm, the Sellers and the Buyers), and
a copy of such materials shall be provided to the other party hereto concurrently with the submission thereof to the Neutral Accounting
Firm. The Sellers and the Buyers shall instruct the Neutral Accounting Firm to promptly, but in no event later than sixty (60)&nbsp;days
after its appointment, determine (based solely on the written presentations of the Sellers and the Buyers timely delivered to the
Neutral Accounting Firm in accordance with this <U>Section 1.4(e)</U> and in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set
forth in this Agreement and not by independent review) only those matters in dispute and to render a written report as to the calculations
of the disputed amounts, which report, absent manifest error, shall thereupon be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto
for all purposes hereunder. Upon the decision of the Neutral Accounting Firm, the Post-Closing Statement, as adjusted to the extent
necessary to reflect the Neutral Accounting Firm&rsquo;s decision, shall be the final Post-Closing Statement. The fees, costs and
expenses of the Neutral Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Sellers and the Buyers based on the inverse of the percentage that
the Neutral Accounting Firm&rsquo;s determination (before such allocation) bears to the total amount of the total items in dispute
as originally submitted to the Neutral Accounting Firm. For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and
the Neutral Accounting Firm award $600 in favor of the Sellers&rsquo; position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by
the Buyers and 40% of the costs would be borne by the Sellers. The fees and expenses of the Sellers and their respective Representatives
incurred in connection with the Post-Closing Statement and any Dispute Notice shall be borne by the Sellers, and the fees and expenses
of the Buyers and their Representatives in connection with the Post-Closing Statement and any Dispute Notice shall be borne by
the Buyers.</P>
