detail and with reasonable backup documentation regarding the calculation of
such amounts, calculated in accordance with GAAP and using the same

calculation of the Closing Payment. The Buyers and their Representatives

calculation of Estimated Working Capital and Estimated Closing Indebtedness.

failure to agree on such amount shall not delay or otherwise prevent the

\- 4 -

 



    



  

(b)  Prior to the Closing on the Closing Date (at such time as
mutually agreed by the Buyers and the Sellers or as otherwise directed by
applicable Gaming Authorities) the Sellers shall conduct a cash count and the
drop of each Company's gaming device  "hoppers" as well as a count of each
Company's liability for all outstanding chips, tokens, tickets and
similar cash equivalents (" _Seller 's Chips_"). A Representative of the
Buyers shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to be present to observe
such cash count, hopper drop count and Seller's Chips liability count if the
Buyers so elect. Such cash count, hopper drop and Seller's Chips count shall
be conclusive and binding upon the Sellers and the Buyers, absent manifest
error, and shall be used in the preparation of Closing Working Capital that is
contained in the Post-Closing Statement (it being understood that the
aggregate value of all outstanding Seller's Chips shall constitute a current
liability of such Company in connection with the calculation of the Closing
Working Capital as of the Effective Time). Within three (3) Business Days
after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall provide the Buyers a list of all
outstanding Seller's Chips in sufficient detail for the Buyers to determine
the type, number and denomination of each of Seller's Chips.

  



  

(c)  As soon as reasonably practicable but in any event within
sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Buyers shall prepare (or cause to
be prepared) and deliver to the Sellers a statement (the " _Post-Closing
Statement_ ") showing the Buyers' calculation of Closing Working Capital
(including, for the avoidance of doubt but subject to the last sentence
of this _Section 1.4(c)_ , the Buyers' calculation of the reserves related to
incurred but not reported claims and other reserves related to insurance
accruals set forth on _Schedule 1.4_ ), and the amount of Closing
Indebtedness, including the calculation thereof in reasonable detail
calculated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement using the same methodology
as the calculation set forth on _Schedule 1.4_ and, based on such
calculations, the Buyers' calculation of the Purchase Price. The Buyers shall
promptly provide to the Sellers such backup or supporting data relating to the
preparation of the Post-Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing
Working Capital, the amount of Closing Indebtedness and the Purchase Price
reflected thereon as the Sellers may reasonably request. The Buyers shall
also provide the Sellers and their Representatives with such reasonable
access to the books, records and personnel of each Company, at reasonable
times and upon reasonable notice, as the Sellers may reasonably request for
the purposes of evaluating the Post-Closing Statement and the Buyers'
calculation of Closing Working Capital, the amount of Closing Indebtedness
and the Purchase Price. The amount of any reserves related to incurred but not
reported claims and other reserves related to insurance accruals set forth on
_Schedule 1.4_ shall be determined as of the Effective Time applying methods
(including estimation methodologies), practices and policies consistent with
those used in determining the reserves or valuation accounts included in
Parent's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019,
except to the extent inconsistent with GAAP.

  



  

(d)  The Sellers shall, within the forty-five (45)-day period
(the " _Acceptance Period_ ") following receipt of such Post-Closing
Statement, notify the Buyers of their acceptance or non-acceptance (as the
case may be) of the Post-Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing
Working Capital, the amount of Closing Indebtedness and the Purchase Price
reflected thereon. If no such notice is delivered to the Buyers by the
Sellers within the Acceptance Period, the Post-Closing Statement and the
calculation of Closing Working Capital, the amount of Closing Indebtedness
and the Purchase Price reflected thereon shall be deemed to have been
accepted by the Sellers and shall be binding thereon for all purposes of this
Agreement. If the Post-Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing
Working Capital, the amount of Closing Indebtedness and the Purchase Price
reflected thereon are accepted or deemed to have been accepted by the
Sellers, then payment of any related amounts, as contemplated by this _Section
1.4(d)_ , shall be made pursuant to _Section 1.4(g)_. If the Sellers give
notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to the Buyers within the Acceptance Period
that the Sellers do not agree with or otherwise do not accept the calculation
of Closing Working Capital, the amount of Closing Indebtedness or the
Purchase Price reflected on the Post-Closing Statement, the Sellers shall
describe in reasonable detail in such Dispute Notice the nature of any
disagreement so asserted including an estimate, to the extent then
reasonably ascertainable, of the amount in dispute of any items then being
disputed. The Buyers and the Sellers shall endeavor in good faith to resolve
all such disagreements within the thirty (30)-day period (the " _Negotiating
Period_ ") following the delivery by the Sellers of such Dispute Notice.

  



  

   

\- 5 -

 



    



  

(e)  If the parties are able to resolve all disputed amounts or
other disputes identified in the Dispute Notice, the Post-Closing Statement,
as modified to reflect such resolution, shall be the final Post-Closing
Statement and shall be binding on all parties for all purposes of this
Agreement. If the Buyers and the Sellers are unable to resolve any
disagreements regarding the Post-Closing Statement and the calculations
reflected thereon within the Negotiating Period, then within fifteen (15) days
after the end of the Negotiating Period all such disputes shall be promptly
referred to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm other than a
"Big 4" firm as is mutually acceptable to the Buyers and the Sellers (the "
_Neutral Accounting Firm_ "). The Neutral Accounting Firm shall be instructed
only to resolve all outstanding disagreements relating to the Post-Closing
Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital, the amount of
Closing Indebtedness and the Purchase Price reflected thereon, and shall be
instructed not to otherwise investigate such matters independently or
introduce different judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles,
practices, procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies in
connection therewith (it being understood that the amount of any reserves
related to incurred but not reported claims and other reserves related to
insurance accruals set forth on _Schedule 1.4_ shall be determined as of the
Effective Time applying methods (including estimation
methodologies), practices and policies consistent with those used in
determining the reserves or valuation accounts included in Parent's audited
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019), except to the
extent inconsistent with GAAP. If the Sellers and the Buyers are unable to
agree upon an accounting firm to serve as the Neutral Accounting Firm within
such fifteen (15)-day period, then the Neutral Accounting Firm shall be an
accountant employed by an accounting firm of national standing, other than a
"Big 4" firm, designated by the American Arbitration Association in New York,
New York (which shall not be the independent auditor of either the Buyers or
the Sellers, Caesars or their respective Affiliates). The Neutral Accounting
Firm shall investigate only those items that the Sellers and the Buyers have
been unable to resolve and shall not assign a value to any item that is (A)
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either of the Buyers
or the Sellers or (B) lower than the lowest value for such item claimed by
either of the Buyers or the Sellers. Each of the Sellers and the Buyers shall
execute and deliver a customary engagement letter as may be reasonably
requested by the Neutral Accounting Firm. The Sellers and the Buyers shall
instruct the Neutral Accounting Firm that, within five (5) Business Days
following its acceptance of its appointment as the Neutral Accounting Firm,
it shall deliver to the Sellers and the Buyers a written notice (the "
_Accountant Notice_ ") setting forth (i) the deadline for the Sellers' and
the Buyers' submission of the written presentations setting forth their
respective positions with respect to the disputed amounts (which deadline
shall in all events be (A) the same for the Sellers and the Buyers and (B) no
sooner than thirty (30) days following the date of delivery of the
Accountant Notice (unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing among the
Neutral Accounting Firm, the Sellers and the Buyers) and no later than forty-
five (45) days following the date of delivery of the Accountant Notice) and
(ii) the format in which the Sellers and the Buyers are to submit their
written presentations (which format shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Sellers and the Buyers). A copy of all materials submitted to the Neutral
Accounting Firm pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be
provided to the Neutral Accounting Firm by the Sellers and the Buyers, as
applicable, no later than the deadline set forth in the Accountant Notice (as
the same may be amended by the mutual written consent of the Neutral
Accounting Firm, the Sellers and the Buyers), and a copy of such materials
shall be provided to the other party hereto concurrently with the submission
thereof to the Neutral Accounting Firm. The Sellers and the Buyers shall
instruct the Neutral Accounting Firm to promptly, but in no event later than
sixty (60) days after its appointment, determine (based solely on the written
presentations of the Sellers and the Buyers timely delivered to the Neutral
Accounting Firm in accordance with this _Section 1.4(e)_ and in accordance
with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement and not by
independent review) only those matters in dispute and to render a written
report as to the calculations of the disputed amounts, which report, absent
manifest error, shall thereupon be conclusive and binding upon the parties
hereto for all purposes hereunder. Upon the decision of the Neutral
Accounting Firm, the Post-Closing Statement, as adjusted to the
extent necessary to reflect the Neutral Accounting Firm's decision, shall be
the final Post-Closing Statement. The fees, costs and expenses of the Neutral
Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Sellers and the Buyers based on the
inverse of the percentage that the Neutral Accounting Firm's determination
(before such allocation) bears to the total amount of the total items in
dispute as originally submitted to the Neutral Accounting Firm. For example,
should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Neutral
Accounting Firm award $600 in favor of the Sellers' position, 60% of the costs
of its review would be borne by the Buyers and 40% of the costs would be
borne by the Sellers. The fees and expenses of the Sellers and their
respective Representatives incurred in connection with the Post-Closing
Statement and any Dispute Notice shall be borne by the Sellers, and the fees
and expenses of the Buyers and their Representatives in connection with the
Post-Closing Statement and any Dispute Notice shall be borne by the Buyers.

(f)  Any dispute with respect to the Remaining Required CapEx
Amount, if any, will be resolved using the procedures set forth above in this
_Section 1.4_.

  



  

(g)  No more than five (5) Business Days following the Post-
Closing Statement becoming final in accordance with this _Section 1.4_ , (A)
if the finally determined Purchase Price exceeds the Closing Payment (such
amount, the " _Actual Surplus_ "), then the Buyers shall pay to the Sellers,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts as
may be designated by the Sellers to the Buyers in writing, an amount equal to
such Actual Surplus, or (B) if the finally determined Purchase Price is less
than the Closing Payment (such amount, the " _Actual Deficiency_ "), then the
Sellers shall pay to the Buyers an amount equal to such Actual Deficiency by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts as
may be designated by the Buyers to the Sellers in writing.

  



  

Section 1.5   _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Within sixty (60)
days following the final determination of Closing Working Capital and the
final Purchase Price, the Buyers shall deliver to the Sellers a schedule (the
" _Allocation Schedule_ ") allocating the Purchase Price (including any
Liabilities and any other amounts required to be taken into account as part of
the Purchase Price for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes) first, between the
Purchased Interests of the Companies in accordance with the allocation of the
Base Purchase Price set forth on _Schedule I_ , and second, with respect to
each Company, among the assets of each Company. The Allocation Schedule shall
be prepared in accordance with Sections 1060 and 743 of the Code, as
applicable, and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any corresponding
provisions of state and local Income Tax Laws). If the Sellers do not notify
the Buyers in writing within twenty (20) days following the Sellers' receipt
of the Allocation Schedule that the Sellers object to the Allocation
Schedule, the Allocation Schedule shall be final and binding upon the parties
to this Agreement. If within such twenty (20)-day period the Sellers so
notify the Buyers, the Sellers and the Buyers shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve the disputed matters. If the Sellers and the Buyers fail to
reach agreement despite their good faith efforts within thirty (30) days
following the Buyers' receipt of the Sellers' notice of objection, then the
Neutral Accounting Firm shall settle any disputed matters and the provisions
of _Section 1.4(e)_ shall apply, _mutatis mutandis._ The Buyers and the
Sellers agree to (a) be bound by the final and binding Allocation Schedule
established in accordance with this _Section 1.5_ (the " _Final Allocation
Schedule_ "), (b) act in accordance with the Final Allocation Schedule in the
filing of all Tax Returns and in the course of any Tax audit, Tax examination
or Tax litigation relating thereto, and (c) take no position and cause their
Affiliates to take no position inconsistent with the Final Allocation Schedule
for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by a change in Law or pursuant to
the good faith resolution of a Tax contest.

is in material default with respect to its obligations under any of such

and for such defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to be material to the Companies taken as a whole.

  



  

(b)  All premiums due on the Insurance Policies have been paid.
No written notice of cancellation or termination or revocation or other
written notice that any such Insurance Policy is no longer in full force or
effect as of the date of this Agreement has been received by the Seller or

authorizations, permits, registrations and declarations as may be required

owns any assets, the failure of which to make or obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to materially impair or
materially delay the Closing, and (iv) any petitions, consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, permits, declarations or filings
required by the Sellers or their respective Affiliates or key employees
(including under the Gaming Laws).

  



  

Section 3.3   _Brokers_. Neither any Buyer nor any of its
Representatives has employed any broker or financial advisor in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.4   _Licensability_. None of the Buyers, nor any of their
directors, managers, officers, principals, controlled Affiliates and Persons
performing management functions similar to officers (any such Persons, "
_Buyer Licensing Affiliates_ ") has ever abandoned or withdrawn (in each
case, in response to a communication from a Gaming Authority regarding a
likely or impending denial, nonrenewal, suspension or revocation) or been
denied or had suspended or not renewed or revoked a Gaming Approval, or
an application for a Gaming Approval by a Gaming Authority. Each Buyer and,
to such Buyer's knowledge, each of its Buyer Licensing Affiliates that are
licensed or hold any Gaming Approval pursuant to applicable Gaming Laws
(collectively, the " _Licensed Parties_ ") are in good standing in each of
the jurisdictions in which the Licensed Parties or the Buyer Licensing
Affiliates own or operate gaming facilities. Except as set forth on _Schedule
3.4_ of the Buyer Disclosure Schedules, to the Buyers' knowledge, there are
no facts, that if known to a Gaming Authority would, under the Gaming Laws,
(a) be reasonably likely to result in the denial, revocation, limitation or
suspension of a Gaming Approval of any of the Licensed Parties or (b) result
in a negative outcome to any finding of suitability proceedings of any
Licensed Parties pending as of the date hereof, or under the
suitability proceedings necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.5   _Compliance with Gaming Laws_.

  



  

(a)  Each of the Buyers and, to the knowledge of the Buyers,
each of the Licensed Parties holds all permits, registrations, findings of
suitability, licenses, variances, exemptions, certificates of occupancy,
orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities, including under the Gaming
Laws, necessary to conduct the business and operations of the Buyers (the "
_Buyer Permits_ "), each of which is in full force and effect in all material
respects, except for such Buyer Permits, the failure of which to hold would
not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to materially
impair or materially delay the Closing. To the knowledge of the Buyers, as of
the date hereof, no event has occurred or condition or state of facts exists
that permits, or upon the giving of notice or passage of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to permit, revocation, non-renewal,
modification, suspension, limitation or termination of any Buyer Permit that
currently is in effect, other than such Buyer Permits the revocation, non-
renewal, modification, suspension, limitation or termination of which, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to
materially impair or materially delay the Closing. Each of the Buyers and, to
the knowledge of the Buyers, each of the Licensed Parties is in compliance
with the terms of the Buyer Permits, except for such failures to comply, that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to
materially impair or materially delay the Closing. As of the date hereof, no
Buyer has received notice of any investigation or review by any Governmental
Entity under any Gaming Law with respect to such Buyer or any of the Buyer
Licensing Affiliates that is pending, and, to the knowledge of the Buyers, no
investigation or review is threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity
indicated any intention to conduct the same, other than those the outcome of
which would not be reasonably like to materially impair or materially delay
the Closing.

knowledge, any Licensed Party has received any written claim, demand, notice,
complaint, court order or administrative order from any Governmental Entity
under, or relating to any violation or possible violation of any Gaming Laws
other than as would not be reasonably likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to materially impair or materially delay the Closing. To the
knowledge of the Buyers, as of the date hereof, there are no facts that if
known to the Gaming Authorities could, under the Gaming Laws, reasonably be
expected to result in the denial, termination, suspension, limitation or
revocation of any Buyer Permit or any other material license, finding of
suitability, registration, permit or approval of the Licensed Parties, other
than those the outcome of which would not be reasonably likely to impair or
materially delay the Closing.

  



  

Section 3.6   _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there are no
actions, claims, suits or legal, administrative or arbitratorial proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of the Buyers, threatened against the Buyers
before any Governmental Entity, nor are the Buyers subject to any judgment,
order or decree of any court or Governmental Entity that would, if determined
adversely, be reasonably likely to (a) materially and adversely affect the
Buyers' performance under this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (b) seek to prevent or
materially delay or materially burden any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

warranties of the Sellers, the Companies or Parent made in _Article II_ or
_Section 8.19(b)_ of this Agreement, any ancillary document entered into in
connection with this Agreement or any certificate delivered in connection
with this Agreement or the Buyers' right to rely upon and seek indemnification
or other remedies in the case of fraud or with respect to a breach of or
inaccuracy in the representations and warranties set forth in _Article II_ or

Section 3.9   _Accredited Investor_. Each Buyer has such knowledge
and experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of its investment as contemplated by this
Agreement and the related documents to which it is a party, and is able to
bear the economic risk of such investment for an indefinite period of time.
Each Buyer has been furnished access to such information and documents as it
has requested and has been afforded an opportunity to ask questions of and
receive answers from Representatives of the Seller Parties concerning the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the related documents to which it
is a party and the purchase of the Purchased Interests contemplated hereby.

Section 4.2   _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a)  No later than ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, the
Seller Parties shall provide the Buyers and the Buyers' legal counsel with an
update to the Employee List, setting forth changes since the date thereof,
with respect to any of the information contained therein (the " _Updated
Employee List_ "). On the Closing Date, the Sellers shall also provide
the Buyers with a list of all employees set forth on the Employee List who
have been furloughed, laid off, subject to a reduced work schedule or
terminated in the six months immediately prior to Closing, regardless of
whether such action triggered notice under WARN, specifying in reasonable
detail for each such employee, work location, action taken, reason for the
action and the length of any temporary actions and samples of written
communications provided to such employees regarding such actions.

  



  

(b)  For a period of not less than one year following the
Closing, the Buyers shall, or shall cause one of their Affiliates
or Subsidiaries (including the Companies) to, provide (i) each employee of a
Company who remains employed by the Companies as of immediately after the
Closing and (ii) each Parent Employee who accepts an offer of employment from,
and commences employment with, the Buyer or one of its Affiliates (including
the Companies) as of the Closing (each of the individuals in subclauses
(i) and (ii), a " _Continuing Employee_ "), to the extent such Continuing
Employee remains an employee of the Company, with (A) base salary or wages
and a target annual cash bonus opportunity (if any) that are no less favorable
than the base salary or wages and target annual cash bonus opportunity such
Continuing Employee was receiving immediately prior to the Closing (if
any) and (B) other employee benefit opportunities that are substantially
similar in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of
the Buyers (excluding from items (A) and (B) any equity-based, retention or
defined benefit pension plan benefits) when applying the same eligibility
criteria that apply in the normal course to the Buyers' employees. For
purposes of this Agreement, Continuing Employees shall include any employee
of a Company who is on furlough or other leave of absence as of
immediately prior to the Closing, which leave status (including dates and
reasons) shall be indicated on the Updated Employee List.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, but subject to any
applicable local or state law(s), (1) nothing herein shall preclude or limit
the right of the Buyers or their applicable Affiliate(s) from terminating the
employment of any Continuing Employee (x) at any time and for any reason
following the ninetieth (90th) day following Closing (the " _Continuation
Period_ ") or (y) for cause or due to any misconduct, gross negligence or
performance reasons during the Continuation Period and (2) nothing herein
requires the provision of any particular compensation element or benefit for
any particular length of time. Further, nothing herein is intended to alter
the at-will employment status of any Continuing Employee. With respect to
offers of employment made by the Buyer to any Parent Employee, such offer of
employment shall not obligate Parent or any Seller Party to pay any
severance or similar benefits to such Parent Employee in connection with such
Parent Employee's decision to accept such offer of employment from the Buyer
or one of its Affiliates (including the Companies). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at Buyer's request, the Seller Parties agree to cause the
employment of the employees identified by Buyer on _Schedule 4.2(b)_ to be
transferred to Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent other than any Company prior
to the Closing, and such employees shall not be considered
"Continuing Employees" or "Parent Employees" for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

   

\- 33 -

 



    



  

(c)  The Buyers and their Subsidiaries shall provide credit for
each Continuing Employee's length of service with the Seller Parties and
their respective Affiliates for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not
for purposes of benefit accrual) under each plan, program, policy or
arrangement of the Buyers and their Subsidiaries applicable to the Continuing
Employees to the same extent such service was recognized under a
substantially similar plan, program, policy or arrangement of the Seller
Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, except that such prior service
credit shall not be required to the extent that it results in a duplication
of benefits. The Buyers and their Subsidiaries shall assume all vacation and
other paid time-off of each Continuing Employee accrued as a current
liability by a Company as of the Closing.

  



  

(d)  To the extent permitted by applicable Law and, only to the
extent required, the consent of any applicable insurer, the Buyers shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause each benefit plan of a Buyer
and its Affiliates or Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employee is
otherwise eligible to participate that is a health or welfare benefit plan
(each, a " _Buyer Welfare Plan_ ") to (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and service conditions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to Continuing Employees,
other than limitations that were in effect with respect to such Continuing
Employees as of the Closing Date under the corresponding plans of the Seller
Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) honor any payments,
charges and expenses of such Continuing Employees (and their eligible
dependents) that were applied toward the deductible and out-of-pocket
maximums under the corresponding plans of the Seller Parties or any of their
respective Affiliates in satisfying any applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket
maximums or co-payments (only to the extent that co-payments apply to
deductibles and/or out-of-pocket maximums) under a corresponding Buyer Welfare
Plan during the same plan year in which such payments, charges and expenses
were made, and (iii) with respect to any medical plan, waive any waiting
period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would
otherwise be applicable to a Continuing Employee to the extent such employee
had satisfied any similar limitation under the corresponding plan of the
Seller Parties or any of their respective Affiliates.

  



  

(e)  The Buyers or their Affiliates or Subsidiaries shall cover
each Continuing Employee who has elected to participate in a flexible
spending account plan maintained by the Seller Parties or one of their
respective Affiliates for the plan year during which the Closing occurs ("
_Seller 's FSA_") under a flexible spending account plan maintained by a
Buyer or one of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries (" _Buyer 's FSA_") at the
same level of coverage elected under Seller's FSA. Each Continuing Employee
shall be treated as if his or her participation in Buyer's FSA had been
continuous from the beginning of the plan year under Seller's FSA in which
the Closing occurs and each existing salary reduction election shall be taken
into account for the remainder of the plan year under Buyer's FSA in which the
Closing occurs, as if made under Buyer's FSA. Buyer's FSA shall provide
reimbursement for medical care expenses and dependent care expenses
incurred by Continuing Employees at any time during the plan year under
Seller's FSA in which the Closing occurs (including claims incurred before
the Closing), up to the amount of such Continuing Employees' elections and
reduced by amounts previously reimbursed by Seller's FSA. Within 30 days
following the Closing Date, the Sellers shall (i) provide to the Buyers an
accounting of the amounts elected, deducted and paid in respect of claims
under Seller's FSA in respect of the Continuing Employees during the plan
year in which the Closing occurs and before the Closing and (ii) pay to the
Buyers the net amount, if any, of the excess of the aggregate amount deducted
over the aggregate amount paid in respect of claims under Seller's FSA in
respect of each Continuing Employee during the plan year in which the Closing

their respective Affiliates, any beneficiary or dependent of any of the
foregoing, or any collective bargaining representative thereof, including with

benefits that may be provided. In addition, nothing in this Agreement shall
be deemed to constitute an amendment or other modification of any Company
Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement of the
Seller Parties, a Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates, or shall
otherwise limit the right of the Seller Parties, the Buyers and their
respective Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any benefit
plan, program, policy or arrangement. Subject to _Section 4.2(b)_ , nothing

further action to comply with the Buyers' covenants under this _Section 4.2_.

has not been satisfied as a result of an Unsuitability Determination),
_Section 5.3(c)_ or _Section 5.3(d)_ shall not have been satisfied or waived,
or in any circumstances in which a Seller Termination Fee is payable.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the foregoing, in no
event shall the Buyers be required to pay the Buyer Termination Fee on more
than one occasion.

  



  

(iii)  Payment of the applicable Termination Fee shall be made by
wire transfer of same day funds to the account or accounts designated by
recipients promptly, but in no event later than five Business Days after the
date of such termination. The parties acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this _Section 6.2(c)_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, that the payment to the relevant party of the
applicable Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 6.2(c)_ shall
constitute liquidated damages in full settlement of any damages of any kind
or nature that the relevant party may suffer or allege as a result of a
termination of this Agreement in the circumstances where the Termination Fee
is paid, it being understood that the amount of liquidated damages represents
the parties' reasonable estimate of actual damages and does not constitute a
penalty and that the Sellers and the Companies and their respective
Affiliates shall be precluded from exercising any other right or
remedy available under this Agreement, applicable Law or otherwise. If the
relevant parties fail to pay any amounts due pursuant to this  _Section
6.2(c)_ by the due date set forth herein, and, in order to obtain such
payment, the other party commences a suit that results in a final and non-
appealable judgment for the amounts set forth in this _Section 6.2(c)_ , the
party determined to owe such amount shall pay to the other party their costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant
to this _Section 6.2(c)_ from the date such payment was required to be made
until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall
Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

(iv)  Any amount payable pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)_ shall be
payable only one time and, subject to the last sentence of this _Section
6.2(c)(iv)_ , in a circumstance where the Termination Fee is payable and paid,
shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the applicable party and
their respective members and Affiliates for all Losses of such Persons in
connection with any and all claims for any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or
otherwise relating to the termination of this Agreement, except in the case
of a claim arising out of fraud or Willful Breach. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary and subject to _Section 8.23_ , the parties acknowledge
that the right to receive the applicable Termination Fee shall not limit or
otherwise affect a party's right to specific performance as provided in
_Section 8.3_  and that a party may pursue both a grant of specific
performance under _Section 8.3_ and the payment of the applicable
Termination Fee under this _Section 6.2_ ; _provided_ that a party shall not
be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance to
cause the Closing to occur and the applicable Termination Fee.

\- 63 -

 



    



  

(d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, except in the case of a claim arising out of fraud, no party
hereto shall be liable under this _Article VII_ for any Losses or alleged
Losses to the extent such Losses or alleged Losses are taken into account in
the calculation of the Closing Working Capital or the amount of Closing
Indebtedness (including any component of any of the foregoing).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no
Buyer Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification with respect to
any Taxes (i) for any taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning after the
Closing Date, except with respect to a breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in _Section 2.5(g)_ or (ii) that are attributable to a
transaction involving the Buyers or any Company occurring on the Closing Date
after the Closing outside the Ordinary Course of Business.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, as used in this _Article VII_ , the term Loss shall not include
exemplary or punitive or similar damages, except where such damages are
recovered from an Indemnified Party by a third party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that nothing contained in the
foregoing sentence shall limit, alter, or waive in any manner or respect any
defenses available to any Person or any burdens of proof or legal
standards required to be met by any Person under applicable Law.

  



  

Section 7.3   _Damage Calculations_. In calculating the amount of
any Losses payable to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article VII_ ,
the amount of the Losses (a) shall not be duplicative of any other Loss for
which an indemnification claim has been paid and (b) shall be computed net of
any amounts actually recovered by such Indemnified Party under any insurance
policy (including the Title Policies) (net of any costs and expenses incurred
in obtaining such recovery). If an Indemnified Party actually recovers an
amount from an insurance policy in respect of Losses that are the subject of
indemnification under this _Article VII_ after all or a portion of such
Losses have been paid by or at the direction of the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this _Article VII_ , the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit
to the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by or at
the direction of the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Losses, plus the
amount received from the insurance policy in respect thereof, less (ii) the
full amount of such Losses, plus the amount of any out-of-pocket costs, fees
or expenses incurred to procure such proceeds and the amount of any increased
insurance premiums, retentions or other out-of-pocket costs related to or
arising therefrom.

  



  

Section 7.4   _Method of Asserting Claims_.

  



  

(a)  In the event any lawsuit, action, proceeding,
investigation, enforcement action, claim or demand in respect of which
an Indemnified Party might seek indemnity under _Section 7.2_ is asserted
against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person
other than Seller or any Affiliate of Seller or the Buyers (a " _Third-Party
Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice with reasonable
promptness to the Indemnifying Party. The failure of any Indemnified Party
to timely provide a Claim Notice hereunder shall not affect such Person's
rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party was actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. The
Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party as soon as practicable
within the Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability to the Indemnified Party under _Section 7.2_ and whether the
Indemnifying Party desires, at its sole cost and expense, to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Third-Party Claim.

  



  

   

\- 64 -

 



    



  

(i)  If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
in writing within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to
defend the Indemnified Party with respect to the Third-Party Claim pursuant to
this _Section 7.4(a)_ , then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, such Third-
Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be
vigorously and diligently prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party to a final
conclusion or shall be settled at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party
(but only with the consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld). If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have full
control of such defense and proceedings, including (except as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence) any settlement thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if requested by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Indemnifying Party and
its counsel in the investigation, trial and defense of any Third-Party Claim
that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to
assume the conduct and control of the settlement and defense if such Third-
Party Claim (A) involves a criminal or governmental proceeding, indictment,
allegation or investigation relating to any Indemnified Party or (B)
constitutes a claim for non-monetary, equitable or injunctive relief against
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party may retain separate counsel that
is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party to participate in, but not
control, any defense or settlement of any Third-Party Claim controlled by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this clause (i), and the Indemnified Party
shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such separate
counsel, except that the Indemnifying Party shall pay the costs and expenses
of one such separate counsel if the Indemnified Party reasonably determines,
based on the advice of outside counsel, (1) that there may be one or more
legal defenses or defense strategies available to such Indemnified Party that
are different from or additional to those available to an applicable
Indemnifying Party or (2) that there exists or is reasonably likely to exist
a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party. The parties shall cooperate with each other in any notifications to
insurers.

  



  

(ii)  If the Indemnifying Party fails, within the Dispute Period,
to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim pursuant to this  _Section
7.4(a)_ , then the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at the sole cost
and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend, compromise or settle the
Third-Party Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the
Indemnifying Parties (but only to the extent that it is finally determined
that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from the
Indemnifying Party pursuant this _Article VII_ ), _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such Third-Party Claim shall not be compromised or settled without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The Indemnified Party shall have full control of such
defense and proceedings, including (except as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence) any settlement thereof. The Indemnifying Party may retain
separate counsel to participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party, pursuant to this clause (ii),
and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect
to such participation. If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a
Third-Party Claim pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)(i)_ or this _Section
7.4(a)(ii)_ , the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party
reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or
settlement.

  



  

   

\- 65 -

 



    



  

(iii)  If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
that it does not dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect
to the Third-Party Claim or fails to notify the Indemnified Party whether the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Third-Party Claim within sixty (60) calendar days of its
receipt of the Claim Notice relating to such Third-Party Claim, the Losses of
the Indemnified Party arising from such Third-Party Claim shall be
conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Losses to the
Indemnified Party on demand following the final determination thereof.

  



  

(b)  In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim
under _Section 7.2_ against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying
Party an Indemnity Notice as soon as reasonably practicable after such
Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact, condition or event which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to Losses for which indemnification may
be sought under this _Article VII_. Any failure to submit any such
Indemnity Notice to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve any Indemnifying
Party of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party was actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. If
the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not
dispute the claim described in such Indemnity Notice or fails to notify the
Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party
disputes the claim described in such Indemnity Notice, the Loss arising from
the claim specified in such Indemnity Notice shall be conclusively deemed a
liability of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the
amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party on demand following the final
determination thereof, in each case subject to the limitations described in
_Section 7.2_.

  



  

(c)  Nothing herein shall waive any party's common law duty to
mitigate any such claim or liability upon and after becoming aware of any
event or condition which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Losses that are indemnifiable under this  _Article VII_.

  



  

Section 7.5   _Exclusivity_. After the Closing, except in the case
of fraud by Parent, the Sellers, the Companies, the Buyers or TRWH or any of
Parent's, the Sellers', the Companies', the Buyer's or TRWH's Representatives,
and to the extent permitted by Law, the indemnities set forth in this
_Article VII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of any Indemnified
Party arising out of any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
nonfulfillment or failure to be performed of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that this exclusive
remedy shall not preclude a party from bringing an action for specific
performance or other equitable remedy following the Closing to the extent not
otherwise prohibited hereunder to require a party to perform its obligations
under this Agreement (including the Buyer's obligations under _Section
1.2(b)_ and each party's obligations under _Section 4.22_ ) or to enforce any
decision or determination of the Neutral Accounting Firm.

  



  

   

\- 66 -

 



    



  

Section 7.6   _Tax Treatment for Indemnity Payments_. All indemnity
payments made pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall be deemed to be, and each
of the Sellers and the Buyers shall treat such payments as, an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for all federal, state, local and foreign Income Tax
purposes except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

  



  

Section 7.7   _No Double Materiality_. For purposes of determining
(a) whether a breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty has
occurred and (b) the dollar amount of Losses with respect to any claim
resulting from any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty, all
"material", "materiality", "in all material respects" or "Material
Adverse Effect" qualifications or exceptions in such representation or
warranty shall be disregarded.

  



  

Section 7.8   _No Waiver of Contractual Representations and
Warranties_. Each of the Sellers and the Companies has agreed that
the Buyers' rights to indemnification for the express representations and
warranties set forth herein are part of the basis of the bargain contemplated
by this Agreement and the Buyers' rights to indemnification shall not be
affected or waived by virtue of (and the Buyers shall be deemed to have
relied upon the express representations and warranties set forth herein
notwithstanding) any knowledge on the part of the Buyers of any untruth of
any such representation or warranty of any Seller or the Companies
expressly set forth in this Agreement, regardless of whether such knowledge
was obtained through the Buyers' own investigation or through disclosure by
the Sellers, one of the Companies or another person, and regardless of whether
such knowledge was obtained before or after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement.

unconditionally agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that it will

WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS

CONTROLLING PERSONS, ADVISORS, AGENTS, ATTORNEYS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY
OF THE FOREGOING). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A)

Section 8.3   _Specific Performance_. Except as set forth in
_Section 6.2(c)_ , the parties agree that irreparable damage, for which
monetary damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached by the parties. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form
of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in the Chancery Court of Delaware or federal
court in Delaware, without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each of the parties agrees that it shall not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other
parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity, other than on the
basis that such remedy is not expressly available pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement. Each party further agrees that no other party nor any other
Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this  _Section 8.3_ , and each party irrevocably waives any
right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
bond or similar instrument.

(a)  When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section or Exhibit or
Schedule of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. All Exhibits and
Schedules of this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference. The table
of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or  "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The phrase "made available" in this Agreement shall
mean that the information referred to has been made available if requested by
the party to whom such information is to be made available. For purposes of
this Agreement, (i) the word "or" is not exclusive and (ii) the words
"herein," "hereby," "hereof," "hereto" and  "herewith" refer to this
Agreement as a whole. The words "provided", "delivered", "made available" or

(b)  Each of the Disclosure Schedules and the Buyer Disclosure
Schedules shall be construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement
to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein. Neither the
specification of any dollar amount in any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the
Disclosure Schedules is intended to vary the definition of "Material Adverse
Effect" and no item in the Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure
Schedules is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts,
or the item so included or other items, are or are not material, and no party
shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of
any such item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether
any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the
Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules is or is not material
for purposes of this Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically
provides otherwise, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in the Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure
Schedules is intended to imply that such item or matter, or other items or
matters, are or are not in the Ordinary Course of Business, and no party shall
use the fact of the setting forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter
in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Disclosure
Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules is or is not in the Ordinary
Course of Business for purposes of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified,
each reference in this Agreement to any numbered schedule is a reference to
the corresponding numbered schedule which is included in the Disclosure
Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules, as applicable. Each numbered
schedule in the Disclosure Schedules and the Buyer Disclosure Schedules
shall be deemed to qualify the corresponding Section of this Agreement and
any other Section to which the application of such disclosure is reasonably
apparent on its face. It is specifically acknowledged that the Disclosure
Schedules and the Buyer Disclosure Schedules may expressly provide exceptions
to a particular Section of _Article II_ (in the case of the Disclosure
Schedules) or _Article III_ (in the case of the Buyer Disclosure Schedules)
notwithstanding that the Section does not state "except as set forth on
Schedule '__'."

  



  

(c)  The parties agree that, for the purposes of _Article II_
(excluding _Section 2.4(a)_ ), _Section 4.1_ , _Section 4.3(a)_ and _Section
4.16_ , and all capitalized terms used in each of the foregoing, any reference
to "Company" or "Seller Party" (or the plural of either such term) shall be
deemed to include the MontBleu Subsidiary.

  



  

Section 8.6   _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.7   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and all documents
and instruments referred to herein constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; _provided_ that
the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect after the
Closing. Each party hereto hereby agrees that, except for the representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement, the certificates and
other agreements delivered in accordance with this Agreement and the
respective Disclosure Schedules, neither the Sellers, on the one hand, nor
the Buyers, on the other, makes any other representations or warranties, and
each hereby disclaims any other representations and warranties made by itself
or any of its respective Representatives or other Representatives, with
respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to any of
them or their respective Representatives of any documentation or other
information with respect to any one or more of the foregoing.

  



  

   

\- 86 -

 



    



  

Section 8.8   _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof, in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



  

Section 8.9   _Assignment_. Except as provided in _Section 8.20(d)_
, without the prior written consent of all of the parties hereto, neither
this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall
be assigned by operation of Law (including by merger or consolidation) or
otherwise; provided that the Buyers may collaterally assign this Agreement to
the TRWH Financing Sources. Any attempted assignment in violation of this
_Section 8.9_ shall be void.

  



  

Section 8.10   _Parties of Interest; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party
hereto and its permitted successors and assigns, and except for the Buyer
Indemnified Persons, the Seller Indemnified Persons and the TRWH Financing
Sources (but only with respect to the provisions of _Sections 8.2, 8.9_ ,
_8.10_ , _8.13_  or _8.23_ , which are intended for the benefit of such TRWH
Financing Sources), and as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.11   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by
facsimile or PDF file (portable document format file) shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.12   _Mutual Drafting_. Each party hereto has participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result
of extensive negotiations between the parties. In the event any ambiguity or
question of intent arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

Section 8.13   _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended other
than by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the Buyers and the
Sellers; _provided_ , that any amendment of _Sections 8.2, 8.9_ , _8.10_ ,
_8.13_ and _8.23_ (or any other provision of this Agreement to the extent an
amendment to such provision would modify the substance of such
foregoing Sections), in each case to the extent such amendment would
adversely affect the rights of a TRWH Financing Source under such
Section, shall also be approved by such TRWH Financing Source (or by the
party to the TRWH Debt Financing document resulting therefrom affiliated with
such TRWH Financing Source).

  



  

Section 8.14   _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing,
the Buyers, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, may, to the
extent legally allowed (i) extend the time for or waive the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant herein and (iii) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. No failure or delay
on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right or remedy
hereunder shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver of,
or acquiescence in, any breach hereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or any other right.

  



  

Section 8.15   _Time of the Essence_. Time is of the essence with
respect to this Agreement and all the terms, provisions, covenants and
conditions herein.

  



  

Section 8.16   _Attorney-Client Privilege_. Recognizing that Milbank
LLP has acted as legal counsel to the Sellers and each Company, and that such
law firm intends to act as legal counsel to the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates (other than the Companies) after the consummation of the Closing,
the Buyers agree that, as to all communications among Milbank LLP, the
Companies and/or the Sellers or their respective representatives that (i)
relate to the period prior to the consummation of the Closing or
(ii) otherwise relate to the negotiations of, or the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege, the work
product privilege, the expectation of client confidence and any other legal
privileges or immunities belong to the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates and may be controlled by the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Buyers, the Companies
or any of their Affiliates or Subsidiaries or be waived by the Buyers, the
Companies or any of their Affiliates or Subsidiaries. The Sellers and their
respective Affiliates may assert the attorney-client privilege, the work
product privilege, the expectation of client confidence and any other legal
privilege or immunity against the Buyers, the Companies or any of their
Affiliates or Subsidiaries to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between the
Buyers, the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates and a third
party (other than a party to this Agreement or any of their respective
Affiliates) after the Closing, the Companies may assert the attorney-
client privilege, the work product privilege or any other applicable
privilege or immunity from disclosure to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by Milbank LLP to such third party; _provided_
that neither the Companies nor any of their Affiliates or Subsidiaries may
waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the Sellers.

Section 8.17   _Representation_. The Buyers hereby agree that,

Closing, following the Closing, Milbank LLP may act as legal counsel to the
Sellers and/or their Affiliates, including in connection with any dispute
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Buyers and the Companies hereby waive any conflicts of interest
that may arise in connection with Milbank LLP representing one or more of the
Sellers or their respective Affiliates after the Closing in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, based on the fact
that Milbank LLP may be deemed to have represented the Companies prior to the
Closing or in connection with the transactions contemplated herein.
