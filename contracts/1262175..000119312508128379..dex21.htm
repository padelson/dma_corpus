Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver (subject to
applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in
accordance with the DGCL, the Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company
at the Effective Time and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the

and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance
with Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time

     | (i) | shall provide, at least fifteen days prior to the Effective
Time, notice to each holder of an option to purchase Shares under the Stock
Option Plans (individually a _Stock Option_ and collectively _Stock Options_

Option will terminate at the expiration of the Exercise Period to the extent
then unexercised, unless the Stock Option terminates earlier by its own terms;
and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

shall provide that any holder of a Stock Option that, in each case, contingent
upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, expires at the expiration of the
Exercise Period by virtue of being outstanding and unexercised at the
expiration of the Exercise Period pursuant to the Stock Option Plans and
Section 3.2(b)(i), but that would otherwise be outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and that has an exercise price that
is less than the Merger   

---|---|--- 



 

Page 4  Consideration shall receive at the Effective Time from the Purchaser or the
Paying Agent (at the direction of the Purchaser) an amount in cash equal to

per Share previously subject to such Stock Option, less any required
withholding taxes.  

---|--- 



   (c) | The Company (at the direction of the Special Committee) shall
provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Restricted Share,
Early Exercise Share and Restricted Stock Unit shall vest and become free of
all such restrictions immediately prior to the Effective Time, and at the

entitled to receive the Merger Consideration from the Purchaser in exchange
for each such Restricted Share, Early Exercise Share and Restricted Stock
Unit, less any required withholding taxes (as provided for in Section 3.5). 
---|--- 


   (d) | The Company (at the direction of the Special Committee): 
---|--- 



     | (i) | after the date hereof, shall take all actions necessary to
provide that the Companys employee stock purchase plan or any other plan,
program or arrangement intending to qualify as a stock purchase plan under
Section 423 of the Code (the _Company ESPP_ ) shall terminate immediately
prior to the Effective Time in accordance with its terms; 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | shall establish for the Company ESPP Purchase Period (as
defined in the Company ESPP) in progress at the date of this Agreement a New
Exercise Date (as defined in the Company ESPP), pursuant to the terms of the
Company ESPP, which shall be no later than thirty (30) Business Days after the
date of this Agreement. In addition, any Offering Periods (as defined in the
Company ESPP) then in progress shall end on the New Exercise Date. The
Company shall ensure that no new Offering Periods or Purchase Periods (as
defined in the Company ESPP) thereunder shall commence under the Company ESPP
following the date of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 


   (e) | At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company (at the direction
of the Special Committee):

     | (i) | and the compensation committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and use its reasonable best efforts to

Page 5 ---|--- 



   (a) | Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary
and to the extent available under the DGCL, any Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by a stockholder who has neither
voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or approval of the Merger nor
consented thereto in writing with respect to such Shares, or is otherwise
entitled to dissenters rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, and who has
validly asserted dissenters rights with respect to the Merger in accordance
with the DGCL for such Shares (the _Dissenting Shares_ ) and otherwise not
withdrawn or lost such rights (a _Dissenting Stockholder_ ), will not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration
unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect, effectively
withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its dissenters rights. 
---|--- 



   (b) | Each Dissenting Stockholder will be only entitled to the rights
with respect to the Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the
provisions of the DGCL, including Section 262 of the DGCL, and will be
entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with
respect to their Dissenting Shares. 
---|--- 


   (c) | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 3.3, all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who have failed to
perfect or who effectively have withdrawn or otherwise lose their dissenters
rights pursuant to the provisions of the DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have
been converted into, and represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration in the manner provided in this Section 3 and will no longer be
Dissenting Shares or Excluded Shares and such holder will no longer be deemed
a Dissenting Stockholder. 
---|--- 



   (d) | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 3.3, if the Merger is abandoned prior to the Effective Time, then the
right of any Dissenting Stockholder to be paid the fair value of such
stockholders Dissenting Shares pursuant to the provisions of the DGCL will
cease. 
---|--- 



   (e) | The Company will give the Purchaser and Merger Sub prompt notice
of any written demands to receive fair value for Shares held by a stockholder,
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to rights of
dissent with respect to the Merger. 
---|--- 



   (f) | The Company will: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | give the Purchaser and Merger Sub the opportunity to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
assertion of dissenters rights; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | not, except with the prior written consent of the Purchaser
or Merger Sub, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
payment of fair value for Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any
such demands or approve any withdrawal or other treatment of any such demands. 
---|---|---

   (a) | Paying Agent. 
---|--- 



     | (i) | For the benefit of the holders of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares), the Purchaser will designate, or cause to be designated, a
bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
_Paying Agent_ ) to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration

     | (ii) | Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Purchaser will
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent in trust for the
benefit of the Companys stockholders cash in amounts sufficient for the
payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being herein referred
to as the _Payment Fund_ ). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, make the payments of the Merger Consideration to the Companys
stockholders contemplated hereby out of the Payment Fund. In the event, from
time to time, any Dissenting Shares cease to be Dissenting Shares, the
Purchaser shall immediately deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent cash in an amount equal to the number of such Dissenting Shares
multiplied by the Merger Consideration. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by the Surviving Corporation. 
---|---|--- 


     | (iv) | Any net profit, interest or other income resulting from
such investments shall become part of the Payment Fund and any amounts in
excess of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in accordance with this
Section 3 (the _Aggregate Merger Consideration_ ) shall be promptly returned
to the Purchaser. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments, or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level
required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated
hereby, the Purchaser shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the
Payment Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that
the Payment Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make
such payments. 
---|---|--- 



   (b) | Payment procedures. 
---|--- 



     | (i) | Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within
three Business Days thereafter), the Purchaser shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each record holder as of the Effective Time, of (x) an outstanding
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Shares (a _Certificate_ ) or (y) Shares represented by book-entry

     | (1) | a letter of transmittal in customary form as reasonably
agreed by the parties specifying that delivery will be effected, and risk of
loss and title will pass, in the case of Certificates, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof
as provided in Section 3.4(e)) to the Paying Agent, or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal; and 
---|---|--- 



 

Page 7 Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
Section 3.4(e)) or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such
Shares, in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Upon the proper surrender of a Certificate (or effective
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or of a Book-Entry Share to the Paying
Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in the amount (after giving
effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.5) equal to
(x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | No interest will be paid to, or accrued for the benefit
of, holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on any amount payable
upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, cash to be paid upon
due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have
been paid or are not applicable. 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to any
person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that: 
---|---|--- 



     | (1) | the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed, with signature guaranteed, or shall be otherwise in proper
form for transfer; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | the person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction
of the Paying Agent or Purchaser that such tax either has been paid or is not
applicable. 
---|---|--- 


     | (vi) | The Paying Agent will accept Certificates upon compliance
with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange of the Certificates in accordance with normal
exchange practices. 
---|---|--- 



   (c) | No further transfers. Other than to settle transfers of Shares
that occurred prior to the Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time,
there will be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
for the transfer of Shares owned by a member of the Purchaser Group. 
---|--- 


 

Page 8 (including the proceeds of any investment thereof) that remains undistributed
to the holders of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares twelve months after
the Effective Time will be delivered to the Purchaser, on demand, and any
holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share who has not theretofore complied
with this Section 3 will thereafter look only to the Purchaser for payment of
his, her or its claims for Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any
required tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.5) upon due surrender of
its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
the Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying
Agent or any other Person will be liable to any former holder of Shares for
any amount delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. 
---|--- 



   (e) | Lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates. In the event any
Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon
such terms as the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation may determine are
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration pursuant to
this Agreement (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as
provided in Section 3.5). 
---|--- 



   3.5 | Withholding rights 
---|--- 



   (a) | Each of the Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable

instruct the Paying Agent to deduct or withhold) such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. 
---|--- 



   (b) | To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Purchaser or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such withheld amounts: 
---|--- 


     | (i) | shall be remitted by the Purchaser or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity; and 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Shares or Stock Options in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Purchaser or the Paying Agent,
as the case may be. 
---|---|--- 



   3.6 | Adjustments to prevent dilution 
---|--- 

In the event that the Company changes the number of Shares, or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares, issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time as  



 

Page 9  a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision,
issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration will be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; provided that
nothing herein shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action
with respect to its securities that is prohibited, or not expressly
permitted, by the terms of this Agreement.

considers that such Takeover Inquiry constitutes or is reasonably likely to

Alternative Acquisition Agreement in connection with a termination pursuant

     | (I) | until after the fifth business day following receipt by the
Purchaser of a written notice (a _Notice of Recommendation Change_ ) from the
Company advising the Purchaser that the Company Board intends to take such
action and specifying all material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal that is the basis for the Recommendation Change (it being understood
that if there is any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
term of such Superior Proposal then such amendment shall require a new Notice
of Recommendation Change and a new five business day period if (A) Purchaser
has not proposed changes to the terms of this Agreement during the initial
five business day period following receipt by the Purchaser of a Notice of
Recommendation Change that cause such Takeover Proposal to cease to constitute
a Superior Proposal but such amendment to the financial terms or any other
material term of such Takeover Proposal is adverse to the Company or (B)
Purchaser has proposed changes to the terms of this Agreement during the
initial five business day period following receipt by the Purchaser of a
Notice of Recommendation Change so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal and such amendment to the financial terms or
any other material term of such Superior Proposal is superior to the changes
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Purchaser); and  
---|---|--- 



 

Page 45 the Purchasers receipt of a Notice of Recommendation Change and prior to
effecting such a Recommendation Change, the Company Board (acting through the
Special Committee) shall have negotiated, and caused its financial and legal
advisors to negotiate, with the Purchaser, and its Representatives, in good
faith (to the extent that the Purchaser desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (III) | until the Company Board (acting through the Special
Committee) has taken into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by the Purchaser in response to a Notice of Recommendation Change or
otherwise and determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that the failure to make a Recommendation Change would still
reasonably be expected to violate its fiduciary duties. 
---|---|--- 
 



   (d) | In addition to its other obligations under this Section 6, the
Company shall keep the Purchaser reasonably informed (orally and in writing)
on a current basis (and in any event within one Business Day of the
occurrence of any changes, developments, discussions or negotiations,
including furnishing copies of any written inquiries, correspondence and draft
documentation and written summaries of any material oral inquiries
or discussions) of the status of any Takeover Inquiry (including the material
terms and conditions thereof and of any modification thereto). Without
limiting the foregoing, from and after the date hereof, the Company shall
promptly (and in any event within one Business Day) notify the Purchaser
(orally and in writing) if it determines to begin providing information or to
engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a Takeover Proposal pursuant
to Section 6.2(b).  
---|--- 



   (e) | Nothing contained in this Agreement (including, without
limitation, this Section 6.2) shall prohibit the Company Board (acting through
the Special Committee) from:

     | (i) | making any "stop, look and listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act; 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S.
federal or state Law with regard to a Takeover Proposal, including taking and
disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | disclosing the fact that the Company Board has received a
Takeover Proposal and the terms of such proposal; or 
---|---|--- 


     | (iv) |

making a Recommendation Change in the absence of, or which is not based upon
the receipt of, a Takeover Proposal but in response to a material development
or change in circumstances occurring or arising after the date of this
Agreement that was neither known to the Company Board nor reasonably
foreseeable by the Company Board as of or prior to the date hereof (and not
relating to developments in the Companys current progress against its
business plan or in

Page 46  response to the proposed Merger or to changes in the financial or equity
markets generally) (such material development or change in circumstances,
subject to such qualifications, a _Company Intervening Event_ ) _provided
that_ if the Company Board (acting through the Special Committee) determines,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Company
Intervening Event, the failure to take any such actions would breach its
fiduciary duties under Law or to comply with obligations under federal
securities Laws or NASDAQ; provided that, the Company Board (acting through
the Special Committee) shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a
Recommendation Change pursuant to this sentence unless the Company has (x)
provided the Purchaser at least five Business Days prior written notice

specifying the reasons therefore in reasonable detail and (y) during such five
Business Day period, if requested by the Purchaser, engaged in good faith
negotiations with the Purchaser to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
obviates the need for a Recommendation Change,

provided that any disclosure pursuant to Section 6.2(e)(ii) or Section
6.2(e)(iii), other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of
the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, shall be deemed to
be a Recommendation Change unless the Company Board (acting through the
Special Committee) (x) expressly reaffirms its recommendation to the Companys
stockholders in favor of adoption of this Agreement or (y) rejects such other
Takeover Proposal.



   (f) | Except as required under this Agreement with respect to the
Purchaser and Merger Sub, the Company shall not take any action to exempt any
Person from the restrictions on takeover offers, business combinations,
control share acquisitions, fair price, moratorium or other similar provisions
contained in the DGCL, including Sections 203, of the DGCL (or any similar
provisions), or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply (including
without limitation by approving a Person becoming an "interested stockholder"
within the meaning of Section 203 of the DGCL) unless such actions are taken
immediately prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms. 
---|--- 



   (g) | The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in this Section 6.2 by any Affiliate or Representative of the Company
shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.2 by the Company. 
---|--- 



   (h) | Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.2, but subject to
Section 8.1(c), except as noted in Section 6.3, the Companys obligations
pursuant to Section 6.3 shall not be affected by: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Takeover Proposal; or 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | a Recommendation Change.

---|--- 


     | (i) | that it shall furnish the Company with such information
relating to the Purchaser Group and the transactions contemplated hereby and
such further and supplemental information as may reasonably requested by the
Company in connection with the preparation of the Company Proxy Statement or
Schedule 13E-3 and any other filings to be made with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware or the SEC and shall promptly notify the Company of any
change to that information; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | that the information supplied, or to be supplied, by the
Purchaser or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Company Proxy Statement and
Schedule 13E-3 shall not, on the date the relevant document is first mailed
to the Companys stockholders, and at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting shall not: 
---|---|--- 



     | (1) | contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
will be made, not false or misleading; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any
statement in the Proxy Statement or Schedule 13E-3, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, which has become false or misleading; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | if any at time prior to the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, any event or information should be discovered by the
Purchaser which applicable Law requires be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Company Proxy Statement or Schedule 13E-3, the Purchaser
shall promptly inform the Company of the same; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | to use reasonable best efforts to have the Company Proxy
Statement and Schedule 13E-3 cleared by the SEC and its staff under the
Exchange Act, as promptly as practicable after such filing; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) |

to use best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to (I)
maintain in effect its existing Multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement with Societe General dated June 4, 2008 (the _Credit Facility_ ),
(II) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to the borrowers
under the Credit Facility that are within their control and (III) enforce its
rights under the Credit Facility. In the event the Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions   

---|---|--- 



 

Page 50  contemplated in the Credit Facility for any reason, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, the Purchaser shall use
its best efforts to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. The Purchaser
shall keep the Company reasonably apprised as to the status of, and any
material developments relating to, the Financing. Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing, the Purchaser shall not be deemed to be in breach of subclause (v)
provided that it funds the Merger Consideration in a timely manner in
accordance with Section 3.4(a)(iii)  

---|--- 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Purchaser nor Merger Sub makes any
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by the
Company which is contained in the Company Proxy Statement or the Schedule
13E-3.



   6.4 | Cooperation and notification of certain events 
---|--- 



   (a) | Notwithstanding any of the other clauses of this Section 6.4,
each party shall cooperate with the other, and shall use reasonable best
efforts, to fulfill the closing conditions set forth in Section 7, including
delivery of all documents set forth in, or necessary to fulfill, such
conditions. Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent that (i) all of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) have been satisfied other than the
condition set forth in Section 7.2(f); and (ii) it is reasonably likely that
such condition will remain unsatisfied as of the Termination Date, then
Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate in an effort to find an
accommodation reasonably satisfactory to both parties that would allow for the
waiver of Section 7.2(f). 
---|--- 



   (b) | From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time each party shall: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | take all reasonable steps necessary or desirable, and
proceed diligently and in good faith and shall use reasonable best efforts to: 
---|---|--- 


     | (1) | obtain, as promptly as practicable, all authorizations,
consents, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities that may be or
become necessary for such partys execution and delivery of, and the
performance of its obligations pursuant to, this Agreement, including under
the HSR Act; 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry
out the purposes of this Agreement;  
---|---|--- 



     | (3) |

resolve any objections that may be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulatory Laws, including (subject to first having used reasonable best
efforts to negotiate a resolution to any such objections) contesting and
resisting any action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to   

---|---|--- 



 

Page 51  have such statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or
administrative order repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to
permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, 

---|--- 

provided however that (x) without the prior written consent of the Purchaser
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Company may not
pay or commit to pay any amount of cash or other consideration, or incur or
commit to incur any liability or other obligation in connection with any of
the foregoing and (y) nothing in this Section 6.4 or any other Section of this
Agreement shall require the Purchaser or Merger Sub to become subject to, or
consent or agree to or otherwise undertake any requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement, or Order to sell, hold separate, divest or otherwise
dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change any
assets or business;



     | (ii) | make as promptly as practicable, and in any event within
the time periods specified below, all necessary filings to be made by them,
and thereafter make any other required or appropriate submissions, with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein including: 
---|---|--- 



     | (1) | a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act within 10
Business Days; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | appropriate filings under any other antitrust, competition
or premerger Law of Austria and Germany within 15 Business Days; 
---|---|--- 


     | (iii) | promptly (and in any event within two Business Days)
notify the other parties of: 
---|---|--- 



     | (1) | any communication from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person (or another Person) is or may be required in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto
from the relevant party or its Representative); 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | any material communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and if any of
the parties receives a request for additional information or documentary
material from any such Governmental Entity that is related to a transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will endeavor in good faith to
make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable, and after
consultation with the other parties, an appropriate response in compliance
with such request and shall provide a copy of such response to the other
parties; 
---|---|--- 


     | (3) | any Proceedings threatened in writing or commenced against
or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are related
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto
from the relevant party or its Representatives); 
---|---|--- 



 

Page 52 pending material Proceedings; and 
---|---|--- 


     | (5) | becoming aware of any event, change, occurrence,
circumstance or development between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time which causes or is reasonably likely to cause the conditions
set forth in Section 7.1 of this Agreement not to be satisfied or result in
such satisfaction being materially delayed; 
---|---|--- 



   (c) | The parties shall cooperate and consult with each other in
connection with the making of all filings, notifications and any other
material actions pursuant to this Section 6.4, subject to applicable Law, by: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | permitting counsel for the other parties review in advance,
and consider in good faith, the view of the other parties with, any proposed
material written communication to any Governmental Entity; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | providing counsel for the other parties with copies of all
filings and submissions made by such party and all correspondence and
information passed between such party and its Representatives with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



   (d) | Unless such party reasonably believes upon the advice of outside
counsel that the failure to do so in a timely manner would cause it to breach
any Laws, a party shall not file any document or take any action if the other
party has reasonably objected (and not withdrawn its objection) to the filing
of such document or the taking of such action on the grounds that such filing
or action would reasonably be expected to either:  
---|--- 



     | (i) | prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | cause a condition set forth in Section 7 to not be
satisfied in a timely manner. 
---|---|--- 



   (e) | None of the parties shall consent to any voluntary extension of
any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest
of any Governmental Entity without the consent of the other hereto (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 
---|--- 


   (f) | The parties agree not to participate, or to permit their
Affiliates to participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unless it so consults with the other parties in advance and, to the
extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other parties the
opportunity to attend and participate, to the extent practicable. 
---|--- 



   (g) |

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no party is required to, and
the Company may not, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), become subject to,
consent or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any
requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or Order to sell, to hold
separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct,   

---|--- 



 

Page 53  restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business of the
Company or any of its Affiliates in any manner which, individually or in
the aggregate with all other such requirements, conditions, understandings,
agreements and Orders, is: 

---|--- 



     | (i) | materially adverse to the Company and its Affiliates, taken
as a whole, either before or after giving effect to the Merger; or 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | requires any material change in the conduct of business of
the Company or any of its divisions as currently conducted relating to a
material portion of the revenues or earnings of the Company. 
---|---|--- 



   (h) | Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company will, upon the request of the Purchaser, become subject to, or consent
or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement,
condition, understanding, agreement or Order to sell, to hold separate or
otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise
change the assets or business of the Company or any of its Affiliates, so
long as such requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or Order is
binding on the Company only in the event that the Closing occurs. 
---|--- 


   6.5 | Access to information 
---|--- 



   (a) | Subject to Law, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time or earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
upon prior written notice, the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its Representatives to: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | afford the Representatives of the Purchaser reasonable

Representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants,
conditions or agreements herein of the other parties. 
---|--- 



   (c) | Any information provided to the Representatives of the Purchaser
pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.  
---|--- 



   6.6 | Public announcements 
---|--- 

Except with respect to any Recommendation Change made in accordance with this
Agreement, the Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company (at the direction of the
Special Committee) agree to consult with each other prior to issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements about this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
prior to making any filings with any third party and/or Governmental Entity
(including NASDAQ), except to the extent that the disclosing party
determines in good faith that it is required to do so by Law, by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of NASDAQ, in which case that

Page 54 ---|--- 



   (a) | The Purchaser shall procure that the Surviving Corporation: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | shall maintain in effect for a period of six years after the
Effective Time, if available, the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance ( _D andO Insurance_) maintained by the Company covering
such Indemnified Parties covered immediately prior to the Effective Time by
the Companys DandO Insurance on terms with respect to coverage and amount that
are no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this
Agreement including for: 
---|---|--- 



     | (1) | any action or failure to take action by any present or
former director or officer of the Company (together, the _Indemnified Parties_
) in such capacity occurring, or alleged to have occurred, prior to the
Effective Time, in their capacities as officers or directors of the Company
(including without limitation, acts or omissions in connection with such
persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if
such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | the adoption and approval of this Agreement, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or arising out of or
pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, 
---|---|--- 

provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are
not less advantageous in the aggregate to the directors and officers of the
Company; or



     | (ii) | shall obtain as of the Effective Time pre-paid "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of six years from the Effective Time
on terms that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties than those of
the existing DandO Insurance maintained by the Company as at the date of this
Agreement, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating to
events which occurred before or at the Effective Time, provided, however
that: 
---|---|--- 



     | (1) | in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend an annual premium for such coverage in excess of 250 percent of the
last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the date
of this Agreement (the _Maximum Premium_ ) (as set forth in Section 6.7(a)(ii)
of the Company Disclosure Letter); and 
---|---|--- 


     | (2) | if such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can
only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, the
Surviving Corporation will obtain that amount of DandO Insurance (or "tail"
coverage) obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium with
the greatest coverage available at a cost not exceeding the Maximum Premium. 
---|---|--- 


 

Page 55 For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser can satisfy its obligations under
Section 6.7(a) by including, or causing the inclusion of, the coverage
required in the existing insurance policies maintained by the Purchaser or one
of its Affiliates.



   (b) | Following the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall procure that
the Surviving Corporation shall, to the extent permitted by Law: 
---|--- 


     | (i) | include and maintain in effect in its respective certificate
of incorporation or bylaws for a period of six years after the Effective Time,
at a minimum provisions regarding the elimination of liability of directors
(or their equivalent), indemnification of officers and directors thereof and
advancement of expenses which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to
the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in
such organizational documents as of the date of this Agreement and shall cause
such provisions not to be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder as of the Effective Time; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | for a period of six years after the Effective Time, honor,
continue in effect and discharge the Companys obligations under all
indemnification agreements of the Company with any Indemnified Party in
effect as of the date of this Agreement without any change that is adverse to
such Indemnified Party. 
---|---|--- 



   (c) | In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | consolidates with or merges into any other Persons and shall
not be the continuing or surviving entity; or 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | transfers all or substantially all of its properties or
assets to any Person, 
---|---|--- 

then and in each case, the Purchaser shall procure that proper provision will
be made so that the applicable successors, assigns or transferees of the
Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.



   (d) | The provisions of this Section 6.7 will survive the Closing and,
after the Effective Time, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and its successors and representatives
after the Effective Time and their rights under this Section 6.7 are in
addition to, and will not be deemed to be exclusive of, any other rights to
which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract,
the Company Organizational Documents (or similar organizational document) of
the Surviving Corporation or otherwise. 
---|--- 



   6.8 | Stock exchange listing 
---|--- 

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with the Purchaser
and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and do or cause to be done all things,  



 

Page 56  reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under Laws and rules
and policies of NASDAQ to enable the Shares to be delisted from the NASDAQ and
to terminate the registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, provided however that such delisting and
termination shall not be effective until after the Effective Time.



   6.9 | Litigation 
---|--- 



   (a) | The Company shall promptly notify the Purchaser and Merger Sub of
any litigation commenced against it or any of its directors, officers or
Affiliates, relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Merger) and shall keep the Purchaser and Merger Sub
reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. 
---|--- 



    (b) | The Company shall give the Purchaser and Merger Sub the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any litigation
against the Company and its directors relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein, and, prior to the earlier of the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the
Company undertakes that no such settlement shall be agreed to without
the Purchasers or Mergers Sub prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). 
---|--- 



   6.10 | Company Tax statements 
---|--- 

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser a
statement ( _FIRPTA Statement_ ) that the Company is not, and within the
previous 5 years has not been, a "United States real property holding
corporation", as defined in section 897(c)(2) of the Code at any time during
the five-year period ending on the date hereof pursuant to Treasury Regulation
section 1.1445-2(c)(3). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, if the Company fails to deliver a FIRPTA Statement the
Purchaser shall be entitled to withhold the amount required to be withheld
pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code from the Merger Consideration pursuant to
this Agreement.



   6.11 | Employees; Company Benefit Plans 
---|--- 



   (a) | For a period of one year following the Closing Date (the
_Continuation Period_ ), the Surviving Corporation will provide all employees
of the Company (other than those employees covered by a collective bargaining
agreement, if any) as of the Effective Time who continue employment with the
Surviving Corporation ( _Employees_ ) with compensation and employee benefits
plans, programs and arrangements that are in the aggregate, no less favorable
than those generally provided to such employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time under the Companys compensation and benefit plans, programs,
policies, practices and arrangements (excluding equity-based programs) in
effect at the Effective Time (it being understood that incentive programs will
remain discretionary); provided, however, that nothing herein will: 
---|--- 


     | (i) | prevent the amendment, modification or termination of any
specific plan, program or arrangement, or any other contract, arrangement or
agreement of the Company in accordance with its terms and applicable Laws or
require that the Surviving Corporation provide or permit investment in the
securities of the Surviving Corporation or interfere with the Surviving
Corporations right or obligation to make such changes in accordance with the
terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan as are necessary to comply with
Law; 
---|---|--- 



 

Page 57 terminating the employment of any Employee for any reason or otherwise limit
the Surviving Corporations discretion over hiring, promotions or retention
of employees; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | shall preclude the Surviving Corporation from terminating
the use of Stock Options, Company ESPP participation or other equity related
Company Benefit Plans; or  
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | require the institution of any new equity or equity-based
benefit plan. 
---|---|--- 



   (b) | The Purchaser shall procure that the Surviving Corporation will,
and shall procure that its Affiliates will, honor or cause to be honored, in
accordance with their terms, all benefit obligations to current and former
employees, consultants and directors of the Company under all Company Benefit
Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be
permitted by such Company Benefit Plans and applicable Laws; provided that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates shall honor the terms
of all Company Benefit Plans that provide for retention, severance and change-
in-control protections, payments and benefits without amending them and
without terminating them (except for amendments or terminations in
accordance with the terms of the Company Benefit Plans, including
terminations due to the other partys actions or due to the satisfaction of
all payment obligations of the Company thereunder). 
---|--- 


   (c) | For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates providing
benefits to any Employees after the Effective Time (the _New Plans_ ), from
and after the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall cause the New Plans to
credit that each Employee with his or her years of service with the Company
and its Affiliates before the Effective Time (including predecessor or
acquired entities or any other entities for which the Company and its
Affiliates have given credit for prior service), to the same extent as such
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan in which such Employee
participates or was eligible to participate immediately before the Effective
Time (such plans collectively the _Old Plans_ ), except for purposes of
benefit accrual under defined benefit plans, for any purpose where service
credit for the applicable period is not provided to participants generally,
and to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of accrual of
benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | each Employee immediately will be eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage
under such New Plan replaces coverage under an Old Plan; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Employee, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Affiliates will cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and   

---|---|--- 



 

Page 58  actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such exclusions
or requirements were waived or were inapplicable under any similar or
comparable Company Benefit Plan, and the Surviving Corporation will cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such Employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan, 

---|--- 
provided that, nothing herein shall require or result in the duplication of
benefits provided to any such Employees.



   (d) | The Company shall ensure that prior to the Effective Time, each
Company Benefit Plan shall be administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms, and in compliance in all material respects with
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other Laws and shall not cause
any excise or penalty Taxes to be incurred pursuant to ERISA. All
contributions (including all employer contributions and employee
salary reduction contributions) required to be made under any of the Company
Benefit Plans to any funds or trusts established thereunder or in connection
therewith shall continue to be made and all contributions for any period
ending on or before the Closing Date which are not yet due will be paid or
will have been properly accrued on the Companys financial records prior to
the Closing Date. 
---|--- 



   (e) | This Section 6.11 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section
6.11, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon
or give any other Person (including Employees) other than the parties and
their permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights
or remedies with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 6.11 and
without limiting the foregoing: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | no provision of this Section 6.11 will create any third
party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee, director or
consultant of the Company in respect of continued employment (or resumed
employment) or any other matter; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | nothing in this Section 6.11 is intended to amend any
Company Benefit Plan, or interfere with the Purchasers or the Surviving
Corporations right from and after the Effective Time to amend or terminate
any Company Benefit Plan or the employment or provision of services by any
director, employee, independent contractor or consultant. 
---|---|--- 


   6.12 | Resignation of directors 
---|--- 

At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser evidence
satisfactory to the Purchaser of the resignation of all directors of the
Company effective as of the Effective Time.



 

Page 59 ---|--- 



   (a) | If any takeover, business combination, control share acquisition,
fair price, moratorium or similar statutes is or may become applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of the Purchaser, Merger Sub and their respective boards of
directors and the Company Board (acting through the Special Committee) will: 
---|--- 


     | (i) | take all necessary action to ensure that such transactions
may be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
takeover statute. 
---|---|--- 



   (b) | The Company Board and the Special Committee, and any other
committee of the Company Board, shall take any further actions within their
authority (in addition to those referred to in Section 4.4) reasonably
requested by the Purchaser in order to render the Rights inapplicable to this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and to cause the Company to terminate the Rights Agreement at the
Effective Time without payment or distribution of any amounts or securities to
any holders of Rights. Except as approved in writing by the Purchaser, the
Company Board and the Special Committee (and any other committee of the
Company Board) shall not: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | terminate, waive any provision of, exempt any Person from or
amend or in any way modify the terms of the Rights Agreement; 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | redeem the Rights; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | take any action with respect to, or make any determination
under, the Rights Agreement. 
---|---|--- 


   (c) | If any Distribution Date or Shares Acquisition Date (each as
defined in the Rights Agreement) occurs under the Rights Agreement at any time
during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the
Company and the Purchaser shall make such adjustment to the Merger
Consideration as the Company and the Purchaser shall mutually agree so as to
preserve the economic benefits that the Company and the Purchaser each
reasonably expected on the date of this Agreement to receive as a result of
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 
---|--- 


   (d) | The approvals and other actions referred to in this Agreement for
the purpose of causing the Rights Agreement and the takeover laws described in
Section 6.13(a) to be inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be irrevocable and, without limiting any
other rights of the Purchaser under this Agreement, any Recommendation Change
or termination of this Agreement shall not have any effect on those approvals
and other actions.

or contemplated by, the Stock Purchase Agreement and related agreements,

Page 82  some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.

representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement. If any provision of
this Agreement, or the application of that provision to any Person or
any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision will be substituted for that provision in order to carry out, so far
as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of the invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of that provision to other Persons or circumstances will not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor will such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of that provision, or
the application of that provision, in any other jurisdiction.

---|---

---|--- 

This Agreement may not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise; provided
that prior to the mailing of the Company Proxy Statement to the Companys
stockholders, the Purchaser may designate, by written notice to the Company,
another wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to be a constituent entity
in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references herein to Merger Sub
shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary, except that all
representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of
the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties
made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such designation,
provided that any such designation shall not impede or delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including by impeding or
delaying approval of the Company Proxy Statement or Schedule 13E-3 by the SEC)
or otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company
under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will

remedy shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other
such right, power or remedy by such party.



 

Page 83 ---|--- 

The parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and money
damages would not be an adequate remedy. It is accordingly agreed that prior
to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8, the parties
will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.



   9.16 | Counterparts; effectiveness

received counterparts hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto; and 
---|--- 


   (b) | the Purchaser and Merger Sub shall have entered into Voting
Agreements with the Voting Parties pursuant to which the Voting Parties shall
vote all Shares owned by them in favor of approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, including the Merger, against any
action, proposal or transaction or agreement involving the Company that would
