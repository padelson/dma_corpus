(c) _Effect of the Closing_. Upon completion of the Closing, the Company shall
be a Subsidiary of Buyer, and references in this Agreement to Buyer after the
Closing shall include the Company, whether or not specifically stated herein.

 



 

2.5 _Adjustments to Purchase Price._

 



 

(a) _Calculation of Working Capital_. The calculation of the Target Working
Capital for the Company is set forth on _Schedule 2.5(a)_ hereto. Closing
Working Capital shall be calculated by employing the same methods, practices,
treatments, principles and procedures as used in determining Target Working
Capital, as set forth on _Schedule 2.5(a)_ hereto (such methods, practices,
treatments, principles and procedures, the " _Accounting Principles_ "), and
in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of this _Section 2.5_. For the
avoidance of doubt and for the purpose of determining Closing Working Capital,
inventory shall be accounted for on a daily average cost basis, and to the
extent there are differences between GAAP and the Accounting Principles, the
Accounting Principles will prevail.

 



 

(b) _Estimated Statement_. The Purchase Price assumes that the Company is
cash-free and debt-free at Closing. On or prior to two (2) Business Days
before the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a statement setting
forth (A) its good faith estimate of (x) Closing Working Capital (" _Estimated
Closing Working Capital_ "), (y) Closing Cash (" _Estimated Closing Cash_ ")
and (z) Closing Debt (" _Estimated Closing Debt_ ") and (B) its calculation of
the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment (such statement, the " _Estimated
Statement_ ").

 



 

(c) _Preparation of Closing Statement_. As promptly as practicable, but no
later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a statement setting forth its calculation of (i) Closing
Working Capital, (ii) Closing Cash, and (iii) Closing Debt (such statement,
the " _Closing Statement_ ").

 



 

(d) _Dispute Notice_. Following the Closing, Buyer shall provide Seller and
its representatives access to the records, properties, personnel and (subject
to the execution of customary work paper access letters if requested) auditors
of the Company relating to the preparation of the Closing Statement and shall
cause the personnel of the Company to cooperate with Seller and its
representatives in connection with its review of the Closing Statement. If
Seller disagrees with the calculation of Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash
and/or Closing Debt, in each case, as shown on the Closing Statement prepared
by Buyer, Seller shall deliver to Buyer, within thirty (30) days after receipt
of the Closing Statement, a statement (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") setting forth
Sellers calculation of such Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, and/or
Closing Debt, and describing in reasonable detail the basis for Sellers
calculation. The Parties shall thereafter use commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve such differences regarding the determination of the disputed
Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, and/or Closing Debt for a period of
thirty (30) days after the Seller has given the Dispute Notice. If the Parties
resolve such differences, the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Cash, and
the Closing Debt, as applicable, agreed to by the Parties shall be deemed to
be the " _Final Closing Working Capital_ ", the " _Final Closing Cash_ ", and
the " _Final Closing Debt_ ", as applicable, and the Closing Statement agreed
to by the Parties shall be deemed to be the " _Final Closing Statement_ ".

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Appointment of Neutral Accountant_. If the Parties do not reach a final
resolution of the Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, and Closing Debt
within thirty (30) days after the Seller has given the Dispute Notice, unless
the Parties mutually agree to continue their efforts to resolve such remaining
differences, the Neutral Accountant shall resolve such remaining differences,
pursuant to an engagement agreement executed by the Parties and the Neutral
Accountant, in the manner provided below. The Parties shall each be entitled
to make a presentation to the Neutral Accountant within ten (10) Business Days
after the engagement of the Neutral Accountant, pursuant to procedures to be
agreed to among Seller, Buyer and the Neutral Accountant (or, if they cannot
agree on such procedures, pursuant to procedures determined by the Neutral
Accountant), regarding such Partys calculation of the Closing Working
Capital, the Closing Cash, and the Closing Debt, as applicable. The Neutral
Accountant shall be required to resolve such remaining disputes and determine
the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Cash, and the Closing Debt, as
applicable, within twenty (20) Business Days after the Parties presentation
to the Neutral Accountant. The Closing Working Capital, the Closing Cash, and
the Closing Debt, as applicable, determined by the Neutral Accountant in
accordance with this _Section 2.5(e)_, shall be deemed to be the Final
Closing Working Capital, the Final Closing Cash, and the Final Closing Debt,
as applicable. The Closing Statement, as adjusted to reflect such
determination, shall be deemed to be the Final Closing Statement. Such
determination by the Neutral Accountant shall be conclusive and binding upon
the Parties, absent fraud.

 



 

(f) _Limitations on Authority of Neutral Accountant_. The Neutral Accountant
shall not be authorized or permitted to:

 



 

(i) determine any questions or matters whatsoever under or in connection with
this Agreement except for the resolution of the dispute between the Parties
regarding the determination of the Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, and
Closing Debt, as applicable, in accordance with this _Section 2.5_;

 



 

(ii) resolve any such dispute by making an adjustment to the Closing Statement
that is outside of the range defined by amounts as finally proposed by the
Parties; or

 



 

(iii) apply any accounting methods, treatments, principles or procedures other
than as described in this _Section 2.5._

 



 

(g) _Fees and Expenses_. The Neutral Accountant shall determine the proportion
of its fees and expenses to be paid by each of Seller and Buyer based on the
degree (as determined by the Neutral Accountant) to which the Neutral
Accountant has accepted the position or positions of Seller and Buyer with
respect to the Closing Statement.

 



 

(h) _Exclusive Method of Resolution_. The Parties agree that the procedure set
forth in this _Section 2.5_ for resolving disputes with respect to the
Closing Working Capital, the Closing Cash, and the Closing Debt, shall be the
sole and exclusive method for resolving any such disputes; provided that this
provision shall not prohibit any Party from instituting litigation to enforce
the ruling of the Neutral Accountant.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) _Deemed Acceptance_. Failure of Buyer to deliver the Closing Statement
shall constitute acceptance by Buyer that (i) the Closing Working Capital
equaled the Estimated Closing Working Capital, (ii) the Closing Cash equaled
the Estimated Closing Cash and (iii) the Closing Debt equaled the Estimated
Closing Debt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may elect to determine
Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, and Closing Debt in the event Buyer
fails to do so, and Seller shall have sixty (60) days following the expiration
of the period for Buyers preparation of the Closing Statement pursuant to
_Section 2.5(c)_ to make such determination. If Sellers determination
indicates that Seller is owed any sums, Seller shall be entitled to deliver a
Dispute Notice, together with Sellers calculations of Closing Working
Capital, Closing Cash, and Closing Debt. Failure of Seller to deliver a
Dispute Notice within thirty (30) days after receiving the Closing Statement
shall constitute acceptance by Seller of the Closing Working Capital, the
Closing Cash, and the Closing Debt set forth on such Closing Statement,
whereupon such Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, and Closing Debt shall
be deemed to be the Final Closing Working Capital, the Final Closing Cash, and
the Final Closing Debt, as applicable, and such Closing Statement shall be
deemed to be the Final Closing Statement. Delivery by Seller of a Dispute
Notice shall constitute final and binding acceptance by Seller of all portions
of the Closing Statement other than those specifically identified in the
Dispute Notice as being subject to dispute. The date on which the Final
Closing Working Capital, the Final Closing Cash, and the Final Closing Debt
are determined or agreed in accordance with this _Section 2.5_ is hereinafter
referred to as the " _Determination Date_."

 



 

(j) _Adjustment Amount_.

 



 

(i) The " _Adjustment Amount_ ", which may be positive or negative, shall mean
(i) Final Closing Working Capital, _minus_ Estimated Closing Working Capital,
_plus_ (ii) Estimated Closing Debt, _minus_ Final Closing Debt, _plus_ (iii)
Final Closing Cash, _minus_ Estimated Closing Cash. If the Adjustment Amount
is a positive number, then the Purchase Price shall be increased by the
Adjustment Amount, and if the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then the
Purchase Price shall be decreased by the absolute value of the Adjustment
Amount. The Adjustment Amount shall be paid in accordance with _Section
2.5(j)(ii)_ below.

 



 

(ii) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number (such amount, the "
_Increase Amount_ "), then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in
any event within three (3) Business Days of the Determination Date, Buyer
shall pay to Seller an amount in cash equal to the Increase Amount by wire
transfer of immediately available funds into an account or accounts designated
by Seller. If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number (the absolute value
of such amount, the _"Deficit Amount_ "), then, promptly following the
Determination Date, and in any event within three (3) Business Days of the
Determination Date, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount in cash equal to the
Deficit Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an account
or accounts designated by Buyer. Upon determination of the Adjustment Amount
pursuant to _Section 2.5_, each of Buyer and Seller shall execute joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse the General Escrow Amount in accordance with this _Section
2.5(j)(ii)_. In no event shall Buyer be entitled to payment pursuant to this
_Section 2.5(j)_ of any amount in excess of the amount in the General Escrow
Account (after taking into account any payments made from such account
pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_).

 



      
 

 



 

2.6 _Costs and Expenses._ Seller has obtained a Title Policy for each Owned
Real Property. Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other, shall each
pay one-half (1/2) of the premium for each Title Policy obtained by Seller.
Seller shall also be responsible for one-half (1/2) of the initial cost of
each Survey it has obtained. Buyer shall pay (i) the cost of any endorsements
to each Title Policy, (ii) one-half (1/2) of the initial cost of each Survey,
together with all additional costs beyond the initial cost therefor (including
updates thereto), which may be in the form of reimbursements to Seller for any
costs Seller paid in excess of the amounts Seller is responsible for hereunder
and (iii) the cost of any recording fees applicable to the transaction
contemplated hereby.

 



 

2.7 _Further Assurances._ At any time and from time to time after the Closing
Date, as and when requested by any Party hereto and at such Partys expense,
the other Party shall promptly execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all such documents, instruments and certificates and shall
take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as are necessary
to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

2.8 _Escrow Accounts._ The General Escrow Account shall be established
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to provide funds against which Buyer-Related
Parties may assert claims of indemnification pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_, and
security for post-Closing adjustments relating to Working Capital, Closing
Cash and Closing Debt. The Environmental Escrow Account shall be established
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement as security for the performance by Seller of
the Corrective Actions or UST Repair Actions, in each case for which Seller
has Responsibility. Seller hereby authorizes and instructs Buyer, at the
Closing, to deduct the General Escrow Amount and the Environmental Escrow
Amount from the Purchase Price, and deliver such funds to the Escrow Agent to
be held in the General Escrow Account or the Environmental Escrow Account, as
applicable, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement. The General Escrow Amount and the Environmental Escrow
Amount shall be released in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

2.9 _Earn-out._ As additional consideration for the Shares, at such times as
provided in _Section 2.9.3_, Buyer shall pay, or cause to paid, to Seller
with respect to each Calculation Period within the Earn-out Period an amount,
if any (each, an " _Earn-out Payment_ "), equal to fifty percent (50%) of the
amount by which Fuel Gross Profit for such Calculation Period exceeds the
Threshold Amount. Fuel Gross Profit shall be calculated by employing the
methods, practices, treatments, principles and procedures as set forth on
_Schedule 2.9_ hereto and in accordance with the definition of Fuel Gross
Profit set forth in _Section 1.1_ of this Agreement.

 



 

2.9.1. _Procedures Applicable to Determination of the Earn-out Payments_.

 



 

(a) On or before the date which is forty-five (45) days after the last day of
each Calculation Period (each such date, an " _Earn-out Calculation Delivery
Date_ "), Buyer shall cause the Company to prepare and deliver to Seller a
written statement (in each case, an " _Earn-out Calculation Statement_ ")
setting forth in reasonable detail its determination of the Fuel Gross Profit
for the applicable Calculation Period and its calculation of the resulting
Earn-out Payment (in each case, an " _Earn-out Calculation_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Seller shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the Earn-out
Calculation Statement for each Calculation Period (in each case, the " _Review
Period_ ") to review the Earn-out Calculation Statement and the Earn-out
Calculation set forth therein. During the Review Period, upon reasonable prior
notice and during normal business hours, Buyer shall provide Seller and its
representatives access to the records, properties, personnel and (subject to
the execution of customary work paper access letters if requested) auditors of
the Company relating to the preparation of the Earn-out Calculation Statement
and shall cause the personnel of the Company to cooperate with Seller and its
representatives in connection with its review of the Earn-out Calculation
Statement. Prior to the expiration of the Review Period, Seller may object to
the Earn-out Calculation set forth in the Earn-out Calculation Statement for
the applicable Calculation Period by delivering a written notice of objection
(an " _Earn-out Calculation Objection Notice_ ") to the Company. Any Earn-out
Calculation Objection Notice shall specify the items in the applicable Earn-
out Calculation disputed by Seller and shall describe in reasonable detail the
basis for such objection, as well as the amount in dispute. If Seller fails to
deliver an Earn-out Calculation Objection Notice to the Company prior to the
expiration of the Review Period, then the Earn-out Calculation set forth in
the Earn-out Calculation Statement shall be final and binding on the parties
hereto. If Seller timely delivers an Earn-out Calculation Objection Notice,
Buyer and Seller shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company to, negotiate in
good faith to resolve the disputed items and agree upon the resulting amount
of the Fuel Gross Profit and the Earn-out Payment for the applicable
Calculation Period. If the Company, Buyer and Seller are unable to reach
agreement within thirty (30) days after such an Earn-out Calculation Objection
Notice has been given, all unresolved disputed items shall be promptly
referred to the Neutral Accountant. The Neutral Accountant shall be directed
to render a written report on the unresolved disputed items with respect to
the applicable Earn-out Calculation as promptly as practicable, but in no
event greater than twenty (20) Business Days after such submission to the
Neutral Accountant, and to resolve only those unresolved disputed items set
forth in the Earn-out Calculation Objection Notice. If unresolved disputed
items are submitted to the Neutral Accountant, Seller shall and Buyer shall
cause the Company to furnish to the Neutral Accountant such work papers,
schedules and other documents and information relating to the unresolved
disputed items as the Neutral Accountant may reasonably request. The Neutral
Accountant shall resolve the disputed items based solely on the applicable
definitions and other terms in this Agreement and the presentations by the
Company and Seller, and not by independent review. The resolution of the
dispute and the calculation of Fuel Gross Profits that is the subject of the
applicable Earn-out Calculation Objection Notice by the Neutral Accountant
shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and the Company, absent
fraud. The Neutral Accountant shall determine (i) the proportion of its fees
and expenses to be paid by each of Seller and Buyer (or the Company) based on
the degree (as determined by the Neutral Accountant) to which the Neutral
Accountant has accepted the position or positions of Seller and Buyer (or the
Company) with respect to the Earn-out Calculation Statement and (ii) whether
any interest shall be payable with respect to such disputed amount as provided
in _Section 2.9.7_.

 



 

2.9.2. _Independence of Earn-out Payments_. Buyers obligation to pay, or
cause to paid, each of the Earn-out Payments to Seller in accordance with
_Section 2.9.1_ is an independent obligation of Buyer and is not otherwise
conditioned or contingent upon the satisfaction of any conditions precedent to
any preceding or subsequent Earn-out Payment and the obligation to pay an
Earn-out Payment to Seller shall not obligate Buyer to pay, or cause to be
paid, any preceding or subsequent Earn-out Payment. For the avoidance of doubt
and by way

 



      
 

 



 

of example, if the conditions precedent to the payment of the Earn-out Payment
for the first Calculation Period are not satisfied, but the conditions
precedent to the payment of the Earn-out Payment for the second Calculation
Period are satisfied, then Buyer would be obligated to pay, or cause to be
paid, such Earn-out Payment for the second Calculation Period for which the
corresponding conditions precedent have been satisfied, but shall not be
obligated to pay any Earn-out Payment for the first Calculation Period.

 



 

2.9.3. _Timing of Payment of Earn-out Payments_. Any Earn-out Payment that
Buyer is required to pay pursuant to _Section 2.9.1(a)_ hereof shall be paid
in full no later than five (5) days following the date upon which the
determination of Fuel Gross Profit for the applicable Calculation Period
becomes final and binding upon the parties as provided in _Section 2.9.1(b)_
(including any final resolution of any dispute raised by Seller in an Earn-out
Calculation Objection Notice). Buyer shall pay, or cause to paid, to Seller
the applicable Earn-out Payment in cash by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated by Seller, together with
any interest payable as set forth in _Section 2.9.7_.

 



 

2.9.4. _Acceleration upon Mutual Agreement_. At any time after the Closing
Date, Buyer may notify Seller in writing of its desire to make a payment
which, once made, would fully release and discharge the Company and the Buyer,
and their successors and assigns, from any further liability or obligation
pursuant to this _Section 2.9_. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith
with respect to any request delivered pursuant to this _Section 2.9.4_;
provided that in no event will Seller be required to grant such request if an
agreement cannot be reached regarding the amount of such payment.

 



 

2.9.5. _Post-Closing Operation of the Business_. The parties hereto agree that
it is in their mutual best interests to maximize the financial performance of
the Company following the Closing in order that Seller shall have a fair and
reasonable opportunity to earn the Earn-out Payments. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, subject to the terms of this Agreement, subsequent to the Closing,
the Company shall have sole discretion with regard to all matters relating to
the operation of the Company and the Business, including, but not limited to,
the pricing of petroleum products, the setting of rebates for the purchase of
petroleum product and, subject to compliance with the terms of _Section
2.9.8_ hereof, transferring ownership or any or all of the Properties to
Affiliates of the Company or Buyer or to any third party, provided, that the
Company and Buyer shall not, directly or indirectly, take any actions (or fail
to take any action) in bad faith that would have the purpose of avoiding or
reducing any of the Earn-out Payments, including by engaging in any activities
or transactions which are intended to, or otherwise have, the effect of
deferring the receipt or recognition of revenue or accelerating the payment or
recognition of expenses taken into account in calculating the Earn-out
Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Company and Buyer do
not intentionally operate the Business in a manner that is intended to
minimize future Earn-out Payments, the Company and Buyer have no obligation to
operate the Company or the Business in a manner that is intended to maximize
the amount of any future Earn-out Payments.

 



 

2.9.6. _No Security_. The parties hereto understand and agree that (i) the
contingent rights to receive any Earn-out Payment shall not be represented by
any form of certificate or other instrument, are not transferable, except by
operation of Laws relating to descent and distribution, divorce and community
property, and do not constitute an equity or

 



       
 

 



 

ownership interest in Buyer or the Company, (ii) Seller shall not have any
rights as a security holder of Buyer or the Company as a result of Sellers
contingent right to receive any Earn-out Payment hereunder, and (iii) no
interest shall be calculated or payable with respect to any Earn-out Payment,
except as set forth in _Section 2.9.7_.

 



 

2.9.7. _Late Payments_. Any Earn-Out Payments or portions thereof due
hereunder which are not paid when due shall bear interest at an annual rate
equal to the Interest Rate, in each case calculated based on the number of
days such Earn-Out Payment or portion thereof is delinquent. Notwithstanding
the foregoing to the contrary, in the event a Earn-out Calculation Objection
Notice has been delivered, no interest shall accrue from the delivery of the
Earn-out Calculation Objection through five (5) days from the later of (i) the
parties resolution of the dispute pursuant to the provisions of _Section
2.9.1(b)_, or (ii) the decision of the Neutral Accountant pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 2.9.1(b)_, provided that, with its decision, the
Neutral Accountant, if it deems it reasonably appropriate, may award Seller
interest for any period of time subsequent to the delivery of the Earn-out
Calculation Objection.

 



 

2.9.8. _Subsequent Dispositions_.

 



 

(a) _Change in Control_. In the event of a Change in Control following the
Closing Date but prior to the expiration of the Earn-out Period, Buyer shall
cause the acquiror pursuant to such Change in Control transaction, to (i)
utilize the Company Earn-out Properties and/or conduct the Companys former
business and operations as a division of the resulting entity (" _Company
Division_ "), (ii) maintain such financial reporting systems as are necessary
to accurately calculate the Fuel Gross Profit of each Company Division through
the expiration of the Earn-out Period, and (iii) assume (in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Seller) the obligations of Buyer and the
Company arising under this _Section 2.9_; provided that nothing in this
_Section 2.9.8(a)_ shall limit the obligations of Buyer and the Company
arising under this _Section 2.9_ with respect to any of the Companys assets
that are not acquired in connection with the Change in Control transaction.

 



 

(b) _Divestitures_.

 



 

(i) _Station Divestitures_. In the event of any closure, sale, conveyance, or
other transfer of any of the Company Earn-out Properties prior to the end of
the Earn-out Period that is not to an Affiliate and that does not constitute a
Change in Control (any such closure, sale, conveyance or transfer, a "
_Station Divestiture_ "), the Threshold Amount shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the Fuel Gross Profit attributable to such Company Earn-Out
Properties during the Calculation Period immediately preceding such Station
Divestiture.

 



 

(ii) _Terminal Divestitures_. In the event of any closure, sale, conveyance,
or other transfer of any of the Terminal Properties prior to the end of the
Earn-out Period that is not to an Affiliate and that does not constitute a
Change in Control (any such closure, sale, conveyance or transfer, a "
_Terminal Divestiture_ "), the Threshold Amount shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the Fuel Gross Profit attributable to each account that is lost in
connection with the consummation of such Terminal Divestiture during the
Calculation Period immediately preceding such Terminal Divestiture. For the
avoidance of doubt, an account will not be deemed to have been lost in
connection with the consummation of a Terminal Divestiture if such account is
transferred to another Terminal Property in connection with such Terminal

 



      
 

 



 

Divestiture.

 



 

(c) _Dispositions to Affiliates_. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent
Buyer from conveying or otherwise transferring any of the Company Earn-Out
Properties to an Affiliate so long as such Affiliate (i) conducts the
Companys former business and operations as a Company Division, (ii) maintains
such financial reporting systems as are necessary to accurately calculate the
Fuel Gross Profit of each Company Division through the expiration of the Earn-
out Period, and (iii) assumes (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Seller) the obligations of Buyer and the Company arising under this
_Section 2.9_.

 



 

2.9.9. _Semiannual Reports_. At Sellers request, by July 31 of each
Calculation Period, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a written
report, showing Buyers calculation of the Fuel Gross Profit generated during
the first half of each Calculation Period, together with reasonably detailed
supporting documentation, which report shall include information regarding any
action taken by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company) during
such calendar quarter that could reasonably be expected to have a material
impact on Fuel Gross Profit, including the acquisition or building of any
station, and the loss of any wholesale account or terminal account.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER**

 



 

Attached hereto are disclosure schedules provided by Seller to Buyer (the "
_Disclosure Schedule_ "). Any exception or qualification set forth in the
Disclosure Schedule with respect to a particular representation, warranty or
covenant contained herein shall be deemed to be an exception or qualification
with respect to any other applicable representations, warranties and covenants
contained in this Agreement to the extent it is reasonably apparent from the
face of such disclosure that such exception or qualification applies for such
other purpose. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedule is intended to broaden the
scope of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Seller contained in

Company_.

 



 

(a) _Seller_. Seller is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of
its organization and is duly qualified to conduct business under the laws of
each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its activities, in each case as they relate
exclusively to the Business, makes such qualification necessary.

 



 

(b) _The Company_. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and is

 



      
 

 



 

duly qualified to conduct business under the laws of each jurisdiction where

of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except for any such
failures to be qualified that would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has all requisite corporate power
and authority to carry on the Business and to own and use the properties now
owned and used by it.

 



 

3.1.2. _Capitalization_.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
representations and warranties in this _Section 3.1.8_ may only be relied
upon for purposes of liability for Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Nothing in this

Code.

 



 

(g) The Company does not provide any post-employment or retiree health

indirectly to the payment of any amount that would be characterized as a
"parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax law). No

necessary for its ownership of the Real Properties and the operation of the
Business at the locations and in the manner currently operated.

revocation or termination of, any Permit, except for any violation, revocation
or termination that would not reasonably be expected to be materially adverse
to the Company.

 



 

(e) There is no unresolved notice of violation of any Permit or any cease or
desist order outstanding with respect to any Permit, and, to Sellers
Knowledge, there is no investigation, proceeding or audit that may result in
the issuance of a notice of violation or cease and desist order with respect
to a Permit.

 



 

3.1.17. _Insurance_. _Section 3.1.17_ of the Disclosure Schedule lists each
material insurance policy to which the Company is a party, all of which are in

under any such policy as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or
disputed by the underwriter of such policy, and the Company is otherwise in
compliance with the terms of such policies, except for any failure to comply
which would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has not received any written notice from the insurer
disclaiming coverage or reserving rights with respect to any pending claim
under any such policy. To Sellers knowledge, (i) the Owned Real Property has
not suffered any damage or loss of property since September 30, 2013 in excess
of $100,000 that is covered by insurance for which an insurance claim has not
been timely filed and (ii) there is no unsatisfied liability claim involving

own account and not with a view to the distribution of any part thereof. Buyer
acknowledges that the Shares have not been registered under U.S. federal or
any applicable state securities laws or the laws of any other jurisdiction and
cannot be resold without registration under such laws or an exemption
therefrom. Buyer represents that (a) it has knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters, that it is capable of evaluating the merits

required to pay its debts (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of
all contingent liabilities). Immediately after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement, Buyer and its Subsidiaries, including the Company, taken as a
whole, shall have adequate capital to carry on its business. No transfer of
property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder,
delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Buyer.

 



 

4.9 _No Other Representations or Warranties._ Except for the representations
and warranties of the Seller set forth in _ARTICLE III_, Buyer hereby
acknowledges and agrees that (a) neither any Seller-Related Party, nor any
other Person, has made or is making any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Business, including with
respect to any information provided or made available to any Buyer-Related
Parties or any other Person, and (b) neither any Seller-Related Parties, nor
any other Person, will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification
obligation or other obligation of any kind or nature to any Buyer-Related
Party or any other Person, resulting from the delivery, dissemination or any
other distribution to any Buyer-Related Parties or any other Person, or the
use by any Buyer-Related Party or any other Person, of any such information
provided or made available to any of them by any Seller-Related Party or any
other Person, including any information, documents, estimates, projections,
forecasts or other forward-looking information, business plans or other
material provided or made available to any Buyer-Related Parties or any other
Person, in "data rooms," confidential information memoranda or management
presentations in anticipation or contemplation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer also acknowledges that its sole and
exclusive recourse in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is to assert the rights of Buyer pursuant to _ARTICLE II, ARTICLE
VI_, _ARTICLE VII_, _ARTICLE VIII_, _ARTICLE IX_, _ARTICLE X_ and _ARTICLE
XI_.

 



 

4.10 _Non-Reliance on Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Forward-Looking
Statements and Business Plans._ In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Business, Buyer-Related Parties have received and may
continue to receive after the date hereof from Seller-Related Parties, certain
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as
well as certain business plan information, regarding the Business. Buyer
hereby acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
statements, as well as in such business plans, with which the Buyer is
familiar, that Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such business
plans, so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information
or business plans), and that Buyer will have no claim against Seller-Related
Parties, or any other Person, with respect thereto. Accordingly, Buyer hereby
acknowledges and agrees that none of the Seller-Related Parties, nor any other
Person, has made or is making any express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-
looking statements or business plans (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
statements or business plans).

 



 

 **ARTICLE V 
COVENANTS**

 



 

5.1 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations and Consents._

 



 

(a) The Parties shall (i) if required, file, or cause to be filed, a

respect to the

 



      
 

 



 

transactions contemplated by this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days
after the date of this Agreement, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to make or
cause to be made all other filings and submissions under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Act and any other laws or regulations applicable to the Parties as may be

waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and any other laws or
regulations applicable to the Parties. Buyer shall be responsible for all

such other laws or regulations, and other out-of-pocket expenses, as are
applicable to Buyer. Buyer shall coordinate and cooperate with the Seller in
exchanging such information and assistance as the Seller may reasonably
request in connection with all of the foregoing.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the terms of _Section 5.1(a)_
above, to the extent required by applicable law, the Parties shall supply
promptly any information and documentary material that may be requested by any
Governmental Entity (including the Antitrust Division, the Federal Trade
Commission and the Office of the Hawaii Attorney General pursuant to the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Act) or any other laws or regulations applicable to the Parties,
and shall cooperate in connection with any filing under applicable antitrust
laws and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement commenced by any
governmental authority, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust
Division or the office of any state attorney general.

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the terms of _Section 5.1(a)_
above, Buyer shall cooperate in good faith with any Governmental Entity
(including the Antitrust Division, the Federal Trade Commission and the Office
of the Hawaii Attorney General pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act) or any
other laws or regulations applicable to Buyer and undertake promptly any and
all action required to complete lawfully the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) complying with any request, directions,
determinations, requirements or conditions of any Governmental Entity
(including the Antitrust Division, the Federal Trade Commission and the Office
of the Hawaii Attorney General pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act), (ii)
complying with other limitations or other requirements of any Governmental
Entity (including the Antitrust Division, the Federal Trade Commission and the
Office of the Hawaii Attorney General pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act)
with respect to the operation of any of Buyers existing assets or businesses
following the Closing, and (iii) taking all other actions necessary or
reasonable, including instigating or defending any proceeding or litigation,
making reasonable offers of compromise, and promptly removing or causing to be
removed any direction, determination, requirement, injunction, order,
condition or limitation, that prevents or would prevent, or that makes
illegal, the timely consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not be required to take
any of the foregoing actions if it would result, or reasonably would be
expected to result, in the loss or, disposition or impairment of assets in
excess of _de minimus_ value, including (A) proffering and/or consenting to an
order providing for the sale, license or other disposition, or the holding
separate, of any material assets, categories of assets or lines of business of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or any material assets

 



      
 

 



 

or lines of business of the Company, (B) selling, licensing or otherwise
disposing of any entities, (C) termination, amending or assigning existing
relationships and contractual rights and obligations, (D) terminating,
amending or assigning existing franchise relationships or agreements relating

specified in _Sections 7.1_ and/or _7.2_

 



 

(d) The Parties shall cooperate with each other in this regard and no Party
shall have any communications with any Governmental Entity without the
participation or consent of the other Parties. Each Party shall notify the
other Parties immediately upon receipt of any correspondence or other
communication from any Governmental Entity.

 



 

(e) Seller shall cause the Company to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, and Buyer shall cooperate with Seller and the Company in obtaining
(which cooperation will include, without limitation, promptly delivering any
financial or other information of Buyer as may be reasonably requested by any
third-party who is being asked for a consent), any consents or approvals of
other Persons (other than any Governmental Entity, which are subject to the
preceding subsections of this _Section 5.1_) in connection with its execution
and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this
Agreement; provided that, except for the Lease Consents, the failure to obtain
such any such consents or approvals shall not affect Buyers obligation to
consummate this Agreement or otherwise hinder or delay the Closing. Subject to
Sellers right to remove a Property for which a Lease Consent has not been
obtained as set forth in _Section 6.16_ of this Agreement, Sellers failure
to obtain any of the Lease Consents shall be deemed a failure to satisfy the
condition set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in connection with
obtaining such consents from other Persons, no Party to this Agreement shall
be required to make payments, commence litigation or agree to modifications of
the terms and conditions of any agreements with such other Persons.

(a) Except (i) as contemplated by this Agreement or the Station Acquisition

the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the
Company to use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) preserve the ordinary

investments to repay loans or make other payments or distributions to Seller
or any of its Affiliates (including such distributions contemplated by

(a) _Access to Information_. Subject to compliance with contractual
obligations and applicable laws and regulations, following the Closing, Seller
and Buyer shall afford to each other and each others Affiliates, authorized
accountants, counsel and other designated representatives reasonable access
(including using commercially reasonable efforts to give access to third
parties possessing information and providing reasonable access to its own
employees who are in possession of relevant information) and duplicating
rights during normal business hours in a manner so as to not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of business to Information within the possession or
control of such Party or its Affiliates, relating to the Business prior to the
Closing, insofar as such access is reasonably required by the other Party.
Information may be requested under this _Section 5.3(a)_ for, without
limitation, financial reporting and accounting matters, preparing financial
statements, preparing, reviewing and analyzing the Closing Statement,
resolving any differences between the Parties with respect to the Closing
Statement, preparing and filing of any Tax Returns, prosecuting any claims for
refund, defending any Tax claims or assessment, preparing securities law or
exchange filings, prosecuting, defending or settling any litigation,
Environmental Matter or insurance claim, performing this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and all other proper business purposes.

 



 

(b) _Access to Personnel_. Following the Closing, each Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make available to the other Party, upon
written request, such Partys and its Affiliates officers, directors,
employees and agents to the extent that such Persons may reasonably be
required in connection with any legal, administrative or other proceedings in
which the requesting Party may from time to time be involved relating to the
Business prior to the Closing or for any other matter referred to in _Section
5.3(a)_.

 



 

(c) _Reimbursement_. A Party providing Information or personnel to another
Party under _Section 5.3(a)_ or _(b)_ shall be entitled to receive from the
recipient, upon the presentation of invoices therefor, payments for such
amounts, relating to supplies, disbursements and other out-of-pocket expenses,
as may reasonably be incurred in providing such Information or personnel;
provided, however, that no such reimbursements shall be required for the
salary or cost of fringe benefits or similar expenses pertaining to employees
or directors of the providing Party or its Affiliates.

 



 

(d) _Retention of Records_. Except as otherwise required by law or agreed to
in writing by the Parties, Buyer and Seller shall each (and each shall cause
its Affiliates to) use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve all
Information in its possession pertaining to the Business prior to the Closing
until the seventh anniversary of the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in lieu of retaining any specific Information, any Party may offer in writing
to the other Party to deliver such Information to the other Party and, if such
offer is not accepted within ninety (90) days, the offered Information may be
disposed of at any time.

 



 

(e) _Preparation of Seller Financial Statements_. Following the Closing, Buyer
shall cause the Company to prepare and provide to Seller all information
relating to the Business reasonably required for Seller to prepare the
financial statements and Tax Returns of Seller for all fiscal periods that
precede or include the Closing Date. During the period of preparation of
financial statements or Tax Returns of Seller, Buyer shall use its

 



       
 

 



 

commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Seller (and its auditors) will
be provided with reasonable access to the Company, its financial management,
including the financial directors of each Business and any accountants work
papers, and their books, accounts and records and will be able to review the
work being carried out in accordance with this _Section 5.3(e)_.

 



 

5.4 _Director, Officer and Manager Indemnification._

 



 

(a) After the Closing Date, the Company shall, and the Buyer shall cause the
Company to, to the fullest extent permitted under the applicable law,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, each individual who, on or prior to the
Closing Date, was an officer or director of the Company (each, together with
such Persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Officer_ "
and collectively, the " _Indemnified Officers_ ") against any Damages arising
out of, relating to or in connection with such persons service as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or service as a director, officer,
employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
or other enterprise, at the request or for the benefit of the Company. In the
event of any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before or after the Closing Date): (i) the
Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the
Indemnified Officers, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, promptly after statements therefor are received and shall pay all
other reasonable expenses incurred in defending against such action in advance
of the final disposition of such action; (ii) the Company will cooperate and
use all reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such
matter; and (iii) to the extent any determination is required to be made with
respect to whether an Indemnified Officers conduct complied with the
standards set forth under the Companys organizational documents, such
determination shall be made by independent legal counsel acceptable to the
Company and the Indemnified Officer; provided, however, that the Company shall
not be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and, provided,
further, that if the Company advances or pays any amount to any Person under
this _Section 5.4(a)_ and if it shall thereafter be finally determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction that such person was not entitled to be
indemnified hereunder for all or any portion of such amount, to the extent
required by law, such Person shall repay such amount or such portion thereof,
as the case may be, to the Company. The Indemnified Officers as a group may
not retain more than one law firm to represent them with respect to each
matter, except to the extent that under applicable standards of professional
conduct such law firm would have a conflict representing such Indemnified
Officers.

 



 

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
cause the Company to maintain in effect directors and officers liability
insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policies on terms not less
favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage; provided,
however, that (i) Buyer or the Company may cause coverage to be extended under
the current directors and officers liability insurance by obtaining at or
prior to the Closing a prepaid, non-cancelable six-year "tail" policy
containing terms not less favorable than the terms of such current insurance
coverage with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Closing Date and (ii) if any claim is asserted or made within such six-year
period, any insurance required to be maintained under this _Section 5.4_
shall be continued in respect of such claim until the final disposition
thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) In the event that the Company, the Buyer or any of their successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made by the Company and the Buyer so that the successors and assigns of the
Company or the Buyer, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations of the
Company or the Buyer, as the case may be, set forth in this _Section 5.4_.

 



 

(d) The Buyer shall pay or cause the Company to pay all reasonable expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified
Officer in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this
_Section 5.4_.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Officer hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Officer may have
under the organizational documents of the Company, any indemnification
agreement, law or otherwise. The Buyer expressly agrees that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification, defense and advancement of expenses and all
limitations on liability existing in favor of the Indemnified Officers as
provided in the organizational documents of the Company or in any other
agreements in effect on the date hereof, shall survive the consummation of the
transaction contemplated hereby and continue in full force and effect, and the
Buyer shall cause the Company to honor such obligations and undertakings after
the Closing in accordance with the terms of the organizational documents of
the Company and such other agreements as they existed as of the date of this
Agreement or, if more favorable to the Indemnified Officers, in accordance
with the terms of the organizational documents of the Company as they exist
when an Indemnified Officer seeks indemnification, defense or other limitation
of liability. The provisions of this _Section 5.4_ shall survive the Closing
and expressly are intended to benefit, and be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Officers.

 



 

5.5 _Disclosure Generally._

 



 

(a) Any information furnished in the Disclosure Schedule (or any update
thereto) shall be deemed to modify all of Sellers representations and
warranties. The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure Schedule (or
any update thereto) shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment,
in and of itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be
disclosed, is material to the Business, has resulted in or would result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect, or is outside the ordinary course of
business.

 



 

(b) Seller shall be entitled to submit to Buyer, from time to time between the
date hereof and the Closing Date, written updates to the Disclosure Schedule
disclosing any events or developments that occur or any information learned
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Sellers representations and warranties contained in _ARTICLE III_ shall
be construed for all purposes of this Agreement in accordance with the
Disclosure Schedule, as so updated; provided that Buyer shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement as a result of any such update to the Disclosure
Schedule to the extent provided in _Section 9.1(f)_.

 



      
 

 



 

5.6 _Certain Employee Benefits Matters._

 



 

(a) Buyer shall take all commercially reasonable actions to permit Employees
to continue in employment with Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Company) immediately following the Closing.

 



 

(b) For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Closing Date,
Buyer and its Affiliates shall provide (or cause the Company to provide) each
continuing Employee with (i) a base salary or regular hourly wage, as
applicable, and cash bonus opportunity, in each case, that is not less than
the base salary or regular hourly wage and cash bonus opportunity provided to
such Employee immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) other compensation
and benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate, to the compensation
and benefits (A) provided to the Employee immediately prior to Closing
(excluding, for this purpose, equity-based compensation) or (B) provided to
similarly-situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates (excluding, for this
purpose, equity-based compensation).

 



 

(c) Subject to applicable law, each Employee, for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting under the Buyer Plans, shall be credited with his or
her period of service with the Company before the Closing Date, to the same
extent as such Employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for
such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan, except to the extent that
such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, subject to
applicable law, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all Buyer Plans, except to the extent that any waiting period
still applied to such Employee under the comparable Company Benefit Plan in
which such Employee participated immediately before the Closing (such plans,
collectively, the " _Existing Plans_ "); and (ii) for purposes of each Buyer
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any
Employee, Buyer and its Affiliates shall cause (or cause the Company to cause)
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such Buyer Plan to be waived for such Employee and his or her covered
dependents (except to the extent that such exclusions or requirements
continued to apply under the Existing Plans as of the Closing Date), and Buyer
and its Affiliates shall cause (or cause the Company to cause) any eligible
expenses incurred by such Employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Existing Plan ending on the date such
Employees participation in the corresponding Buyer Plan begins to be taken
into account under such Buyer Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
co-payments and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Employee
and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such Buyer Plan.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall be solely responsible for satisfying obligations under Section
601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code to provide continuation
coverage to or with respect to any Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) with respect to any "qualifying event" which occurs after the
Closing and relates to such Employees employment with Buyer or any Affiliate
of Buyer (including the Company), and for any Employee (and the spouse and
other dependents of any Employee) who is or becomes an "MandA qualified
beneficiary" in accordance with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as determined pursuant to Treasury Regulation 54.4980B-9, QandA 4 et
seq. or such other applicable laws.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Buyer agrees that it shall not, nor shall it permit the Company to, at any
time prior to ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, effectuate a "plant
closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms are defined in the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended (together with any similar
state or local statute, rule or regulation, " _WARN_ ") without complying in
all material respects with the notice requirements and all other provisions of
WARN.

 



 

(f) If requested by Buyer, subject to the terms of any such Company Benefit
Plan, the Companys Board of Directors shall adopt resolutions terminating,
effective at least one day prior to the Closing Date (the " _ERISA Effective
Date_ "), any Company Benefit Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
(each, a " _Company 401(k) Plan_"). At the Closing, Seller shall provide
Buyer with executed resolutions of the Companys or Sellers Board of
Directors authorizing such termination and amending any such 401(k) Plan
commensurate with its termination to the extent necessary to comply with all
applicable laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Employee who remains an employee of Buyer or its Affiliates following the
Closing and who satisfies the eligibility requirements of a tax-qualified
deferred contribution retirement plan maintained by Buyer or one of its
Affiliates in which the Employees are eligible to participate (the " _Buyer
401(k) Plan_") (taking into account any credit for service required by this
_Section 5.6_) shall become eligible to participate in Buyers 401(k) Plan on
the Closing Date and shall be credited with eligibility service and vesting
service for all periods of service with the Company or any other entity to the
extent so credited with such service under the applicable Company 401(k) Plan.
Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall take any and all action necessary
(including necessary plan amendments) to cause the Buyer 401(k) Plan to permit
any such Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(3) of the Code, inclusive
of loans), in the form of cash or notes (in the case of loans), in an amount
equal to the full account balance distributable to such Employee from the
applicable Company 401(k) Plan to the Buyer 401(k) Plan.

 



 

(g) No provision of this Agreement shall (i) be deemed to create any contract
of employment or severance between Buyer and/or Company and any current or
former employee of the Company, (ii) create any third-party beneficiary or
other rights in any current or former Employee, director or other service
provider of the Company, or (iii) be construed as an amendment, waiver or
creation of any Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

5.7 _Resignations._ Seller shall cause the officers, directors and managers
identified to Seller by Buyer in writing no later than five Business Days
prior to the Closing, to resign from their position with the Company effective
upon the Closing.

 



 

5.8 _Conduct of Parties Prior to the Closing._ The Parties hereby agree that,
between the date hereof and the Closing, except as contemplated by this
Agreement, they shall not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written
consent of the other, take or cause to be taken any action that could be
expected to materially delay, impair or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or propose, announce an
intention, enter into any agreement or otherwise make a commitment to take any
such action.

 



      
 

 



 

5.9 _Replacement of Letters of Credit._ Unless otherwise agreed to in writing
by Seller, Buyer shall use its best efforts to arrange, prior to the Closing,
for replacement arrangements (which shall include a full and complete release
of Seller and its Affiliates, other than the Company), including, to the
extent required, guarantees, surety bonds and letters of comfort, reasonably
satisfactory to Seller with respect to all surety bonds, letters of credit and
other borrowings or other contractual obligations of the Business which are
set forth on _Schedule 5.9_. In the event that, despite Buyers best efforts,
Buyer and is unable to effectuate such replacement arrangements with the
counter parties to such obligations, then upon the Closing, Buyer and its
Subsidiaries shall provide the Seller and Seller-Related Parties with an
indemnity reasonably acceptable to Seller and Seller-Related Parties,
indemnifying and holding harmless Seller and Seller-Related Parties from and
against any and all liabilities, costs, losses, damages and/or expenses which
Seller and Seller-Related Parties may suffer as a result of their continuing
liability on such guarantees, surety bonds, covenants, indemnities, letters of
credit and other borrowings or other contractual obligations.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI 
PROPERTY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS**

 



 

6.1 _Buyer Property Inspections._

 



 

(a) _Property Condition_. Buyer has agreed to the Purchase Price, in part, on
the assumption that each Property: (i) is in substantially good working order
and repair, subject to normal wear and tear; and (ii) except as set forth on
_Section 6.1(a)_ to the Disclosure Schedule, is in substantial compliance
with all laws, statutes, ordinances and governmental regulations as are
required to operate such Property for the use it is being operated as of the
Effective Date. Except as specifically provided in _Article III_, Seller
makes no representation or warranty regarding the foregoing. The provisions of
this _ARTICLE VI_ shall be the sole and exclusive method of addressing the
physical condition of the Property and the physical improvements thereon. This
_Section 6.1_ shall not apply to any Buyer Environmental Investigation which
shall be conducted pursuant to _Section 6.3_ of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Inspection of Above-Ground Improvements, Fixtures and Equipment Other
than UST Systems, Dispensers and Ancillary Components Thereof_. During the
Inspection Period, Buyer shall have the right to inspect the above-ground
physical improvements, fixtures and equipment at (i) each Property (other than
a Terminal Property) by using the property inspector set forth on _Section
6.1(b)(i)_ of the Disclosure Schedule and (ii) each Terminal Property by using
the property inspector set forth on _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule (each such property inspector, a " _Property Inspector_ " and
together, the " _Property Inspectors_ "). All costs of the inspections by the
Property Inspectors shall be paid by Buyer. Each of the Property Inspectors
shall, prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period and within fifteen
(15) Business Days after performing an inspection, prepare and deliver to
Buyer and Seller a written report (each, an " _Inspection Report_ ") (i)
identifying each Defective Condition and (ii) providing an estimated cost to
correct each Defective Condition.

 



 

(c) _Remedies for Defective Conditions_. As Buyers sole and exclusive remedy
for any Defective Condition at a Property identified in any Inspection Report,

 



      
 

 



 

the Seller shall, at Sellers election and subject to the terms hereof, choose
one of the following options as to each Defective Condition (as any one
Property may have more than one identified Defective Condition): (i) correct
the Defective Condition at Sellers sole cost and expense (" _Option (1)_ "),
(ii) credit Buyer at Closing against the Purchase Price an amount equal to the
estimated cost to correct such Defective Condition as indicated in the
Inspection Report (" _Option (2)_ "), in which event Buyer shall assume full
Responsibility for the Defective Condition, or (iii) if the estimated cost to
correct all the Defective Condition(s) at any one Property is equal to or
greater than the Station Correction Cost Cap (or, with respect to any Terminal
Property, equal to or greater than Terminal Correction Cost Cap), then, Seller
may elect to designate such Property as an Excluded Property as provided for,
and subject to the terms of, _Section 6.5(b)_ (" _Option (3)_ "). Within ten
(10) days following the Final Report Date, Seller shall notify Buyer in
writing whether Seller elects to pursue Option (1), Option (2) or Option (3)
for each Defective Condition identified in the Inspection Report. Sellers
failure to provide Buyer with such notice for any such Defective Condition on
or before the date required herein shall be deemed Sellers election to pursue
Option (1) for such Defective Condition.

 



 

(d) _Remedies Procedure_.

 



 

(i) _Option (1)_. If Seller elects to correct a Defective Condition in
accordance with Option (1), then the procedures set forth in this _Section
6.1(d)(i)_ shall apply. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
correct the Defective Condition(s). Once Seller believes the Defective
Condition has been corrected, Seller shall provide written notice thereof to
Buyer and the applicable Property Inspector. The applicable Property Inspector
shall make a follow-up inspection of such Defective Condition solely for the
purpose of confirming whether the Defective Condition originally identified in
the Inspection Report was corrected; provided that such Property Inspector
will not be obligated to issue any further report in connection with any
follow-up inspection. If necessary, Seller shall continue to diligently pursue
to completion the correction of any Defective Condition originally identified
in the Inspection Report that the applicable Property Inspector indicates was
not corrected in such follow-up inspection. Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to correct Defective Condition(s) prior to the Closing
Date. However, if, despite the commercially reasonable efforts a Defective
Condition has not been corrected prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall not
have the right to delay the Closing, but Seller shall diligently correct such
Defective Condition(s) following the Closing Date in such manner as minimizes
interference with Buyers business on the Property; provided that if the
estimated cost to repair the Defective Condition(s) not repaired prior to
Closing exceeds $300,000 in the aggregate, Seller shall deposit such amount
into the Environmental Escrow Account at Closing, with such amounts to be
withdrawn in the same manner as amounts are withdrawn from the Environmental
Escrow Account as it relates to UST Repair Actions and with appropriate
conforming changes made to the form of Escrow Agreement to reflect the
addition of such funds to the Environmental Escrow Account. Buyer shall afford
Seller and its agents access to the applicable Property as are necessary to
complete the corrective work.

 



 

(ii) _Option (2)_. If Seller elects to pursue Option (2) with respect to any
particular Defective Condition, then Buyer shall receive credit at Closing
against the Purchase Price and thereafter be solely responsible for correcting
such Defective Condition(s).

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) _Option (3)_. If Seller elects to pursue Option (3) with respect to any
particular Defective Condition, then the procedures set forth in _Section
6.5_ shall apply.

 



 

(e) _Inspection and Testing of UST Systems, Dispensers and Ancillary
Components Thereof_. Any testing and inspection by Buyer of UST Systems,
Dispensers and ancillary components thereof at the Properties shall be
performed exclusively pursuant to this _Section 6.1(e)_. Buyer shall have the
right to have the Tank Tester set forth on _Section 6.1(e)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule perform a Tank Integrity Test on or inspect any of the UST Systems,
Dispensers or ancillary components thereof, including but not limited to vapor
recovery equipment, on the Properties. All costs of the inspections by the
Tank Tester shall be paid by Buyer. The Tank Tester shall, prior to the
expiration of the Inspection Period and within fifteen (15) Business Days
after performing an investigation, prepare and deliver to Buyer and Seller a
written report (the " _Tank Integrity Test Report_ ") (i) identifying any UST
Defective Conditions and (ii) providing an itemization of the estimated cost
of the UST Repair Action for each such UST Defective Condition.

 



 

(f) _Remedies for UST Defective Conditions_. As Buyers sole and exclusive
remedy for any UST Defective Condition at a Property identified in any Tank
Integrity Inspection Report, Seller shall, at Sellers election and subject to
the terms hereof, choose one of the following options as to each UST Defective
Condition (as any one Property may have more than one identified UST Defective
Condition): (i) correct the UST Defective Condition at Sellers sole cost and
expense (" _UST Option (1)_ "), in which case, such UST Defective Condition
shall be Sellers Responsibility pursuant to _Section 6.4.1(a)(iv)_ and Buyer
shall deposit, on behalf of Seller, the aggregate of all UST Repair Action
Cost Estimates for such UST Defective Condition in the Environmental Escrow
Account on the Closing Date in accordance with _Section 2.4(b)(vii)_ and as
contemplated by _Section 6.5(a)_, (ii) credit Buyer at Closing against the
Purchase Price an amount equal to the estimated cost to correct such UST
Defective Condition as indicated in the Tank Integrity Inspection Report ("
_UST Option (2)_ "), in which case Buyer shall assume full Responsibility for
the UST Defective Condition and all UST Repair Action associated with such UST
Defective Condition, or (iii) if the Environmental Action Cost Estimate for
(A) any individual Real Property (other than any Terminal Property) equals or
exceeds the Station Removal Threshold, or (B) any Terminal Property equals or
exceeds the Terminal Removal Threshold, then, Seller may elect to designate
such Property as an Excluded Property as provided for, and subject to the
terms of, _Section 6.5(b)_ (" _UST Option (3)_ "). Within ten (10) days
following the Final Report Date, Seller shall notify Buyer in writing whether
Seller elects to pursue UST Option (1), UST Option (2) or UST Option (3) for
each UST Defective Condition identified in the Tank Integrity Inspection
Report. Sellers failure to provide Buyer with such notice for a particular
UST Defective Condition on or before the date required herein shall be deemed
Sellers election to pursue UST Option (1) for such UST Defective Condition.

 



 

(g) _No Buyer Inspection of Acquired Station Properties_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Buyer be
permitted to conduct, or cause to be conducted, any Buyer Inspection at any of
the Acquired Station Properties.

 



      
 

 



 

6.2 _Scheduling of Environmental Conditions._

 



 

6.2.1. _Ongoing Corrective Action Properties_. _Section 6.2.1_ of the
Disclosure Schedule identifies each Real Property at which Ongoing Corrective
Action is being performed by the Company or Seller on behalf of the Company as
of the Effective Date and sets forth the estimated remaining future cost, as
of the Effective Date, to achieve NFA Status (" _Ongoing Corrective Action
Cost Estimates_ ").

 



 

6.2.2. _Third-Party Corrective Action Properties_. _Section 6.2.2_ of the
Disclosure Schedule identifies each Real Property at which Ongoing Corrective
Action is being performed by third parties, not the Company or Seller on
behalf of the Company, as of the Effective Date.

 



 

6.2.3. _Properties With Corrective Action Achieving NFA Status. Section 6.2.3_
of the Disclosure Schedule identifies each Real Property, other than any Real
Property listed on _Section 6.2.1_ or _Section 6.2.2_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, with Corrective Action that has achieved No Further Action Status
(including the date on which such status was achieved) prior to the Effective
Date.

 



 

6.2.4. _No Release Properties_. _Section 6.2.4_ of the Disclosure Schedule
identifies each Real Property at which a Release has not been discovered by
Seller or the Company and where there is no Ongoing Corrective Action as of
the Effective Date.

 



 

6.2.5. _Third Party Claims_. _Section 6.2.5_ of the Disclosure Schedule
identifies each Real Property at which, as of the Effective Date: (a) a third
party has alleged or reported that a Release has occurred at the Real
Property, (b) Corrective Action is not occurring at such Real Property and (c)
No Further Action Status has not been achieved.

 



 

6.3 _Buyer Environmental Investigations._

 



 

6.3.1. _Buyer Environmental Investigation Procedure_.

 



 

(a) During the Inspection Period, Buyer shall have the right to have the
environmental consultant set forth on _Section 6.3.1(a)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule (the " _Buyer Environmental Consultant_ ") conduct Buyer
Environmental Investigations at one or more of the Properties. All costs of
the investigations by the Buyer Environmental Consultant shall be paid by
Buyer. Buyer Environmental Investigations shall be performed in accordance
with a Property-specific work plan reasonably acceptable to and approved in
writing by the Company. Buyer Environmental Investigations shall not
unreasonably disrupt business operations at the Property.

 



 

(b) The Buyer Environmental Consultant shall, prior to the expiration of the
Inspection Period and within fifteen (15) Business Days after the submission
of samples for laboratory analysis, prepare and deliver to Buyer and Seller a
separate written report for each Property at which a Buyer Environmental
Investigation was performed (i) stating whether any Release was discovered,
(ii) detailing the work performed, and (iii) describing the results, of the
work performed, including boring logs, figure(s) depicting boring and sampling
locations, tables containing analytical results of soil and groundwater
sampling and laboratory report(s) or some reasonable combination thereof,
which is necessary to identify with reasonable specificity,

 



      
 

 



 

any Release that the Buyer Environmental Consultant states it has discovered
at such Property (" _Buyer Environmental Investigation Report_ ").

 



 

(c) As to any Release identified during a Buyer Environmental Investigation at
any Real Property listed on _Section 6.2.3_ of the Disclosure Schedule, the
Parties agree to reasonably consult regarding the nature of the Release
identified in the Buyer Environmental Investigation Report, taking into
account the factual conditions upon which NFA Status was achieved. If, in the
reasonable judgment of Buyer, the Release constitutes a new Release, Seller
shall proceed to report the Release to the Responsible Governmental Agency. In
the event a Responsible Governmental Agency does not assign a new case number
to such Release within ninety days of the reporting, Seller shall have no
further Responsibility for Corrective Action at such Real Property and Buyer
shall promptly reimburse Seller for all reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket
costs incurred by Seller after reporting such Release to the Responsible
Governmental Agency. In the event the Responsible Governmental Agency assigns
a new case number and determines that additional Corrective Action is required
in order to preserve or requalify for NFA Status, Seller shall be Responsible
for such Corrective Action at such Real Property pursuant to _Section
6.4.1(a)(ii)_.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall Buyer be permitted to conduct, or cause to be conducted, any Buyer
Environmental Investigation at any of the Acquired Station Properties.

 



 

6.3.2. _Dispute Resolution to Determine Responsibility for Releases and/or
Environmental Action Cost Estimates_.

 



 

(a) If Buyer contends but Seller disputes that Seller is responsible for a
Release identified during a Buyer Environmental Investigation pursuant to
_Section 6.3.1_ of this Agreement or if Buyer disputes a Seller-provided
Environmental Action Cost Estimate, the Dispute shall be referred to an
Environmental Arbiter for resolution prior to the expiration of the Inspection
Period pursuant to the following procedure. Within ten (10) Business Days of
receipt of the Buyer Environmental Investigation Report or Sellers
Environmental Action Cost Estimate, the disputing Party shall notify the other
Party of any Dispute related thereto. Within seven (7) Business Days of such
notice, (i) Seller and Buyer shall each select a qualified environmental
professional to serve as an Environmental Arbiter and (ii) the two
Environmental Arbiters so designated shall jointly select a third
Environmental Arbiter who, unless consented to by each of Buyer and Seller,
has not rendered services to Seller or Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates, within the past five (5) years. Within seven (7) Business Days
following the selection of the third Environmental Arbiter, Buyer and Seller
shall each submit in writing a concise statement of its position, along with
any supporting information. The Environmental Arbiters shall consider all
information submitted by Buyer and Seller to make the final determination, but
shall not perform additional on-site studies or evaluations unless agreed to
by Seller and Buyer. The Environmental Arbiters shall be instructed to base
their determination of any disputes on the lowest cost alternative available
consistent with applicable Environmental Laws. The Environmental Arbiters
shall issue a written opinion setting forth their determination within fifteen
(15) days after the submissions by the Parties. The Environmental Arbiters
determination shall be final and binding; provided, however, if a Dispute
involves potential Corrective Action costs and/or UST Repair Action costs, and
the Environmental

 



       
 

 



 

Arbiters confirm such costs are in excess of the Station Removal Threshold or
the Terminal Removal Threshold, as applicable, such Real Property shall be
eligible to become an Excluded Property pursuant to the procedures specified
in _Section 6.5_. Buyer and Seller shall each pay the costs of the
Environmental Arbiter selected by them, and one-half of the cost of the third
Environmental Arbiter.

 



 

(b) If the Parties are engaged in the dispute resolution procedure described
in _Section 6.3.2(a)_ with respect to one or more Disputes relating to an
Environmental Action Cost Estimate the highest proposed amount of which is
less than the Station Removal Threshold or the Terminal Removal Threshold, as
applicable, and which remain unresolved as of the Closing Date, the Real
Property which is the subject of such Dispute shall not be an Excluded
Property at the Closing, the Purchase Price in respect thereof shall be paid
to Seller, and there shall be deposited into the Environmental Escrow Account,
the mean between Sellers Environmental Action Cost Estimate and the
Environmental Action Cost Estimate asserted by Buyer. Promptly following
resolution of such Dispute, Seller shall deposit into the Environmental Escrow
Account any shortfall with respect to that amount of such Real Propertys
Environmental Action Cost Estimate that was previously deposited into the
Environmental Escrow Account, or the Parties shall cause the Escrow Agent to
promptly release to Seller any surplus Environmental Action Cost Estimate for
such Real Property that was previously deposited into the Environmental Escrow
Account, as applicable in keeping with the resolution of the Dispute.

 



 

6.3.3. _Confidentiality_. Buyer shall not, and shall cause Buyers
Representatives not to, disclose to any third party information obtained
during any Buyer Environmental Investigation without Sellers written consent,
which may be given or withheld in Sellers sole and absolute discretion.
Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, Buyer may, subject to and in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, share such
information with its professionals retained for this transaction, including
environmental consultants, attorneys and accountants.

 



 

6.4 _Environmental Responsibility after Closing._ This _ARTICLE VI_ shall
exclusively govern the Parties allocation of responsibility for, and rights
and obligations pertaining to, Defective Conditions, Releases, Corrective
Action, UST Repair Action and Environmental Liabilities, except that Buyer may
proceed under _ARTICLE VIII_ in the event of any breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.2_ and in the event
that Buyer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to the terms of _Section
6.14_, in each case, subject to the limitations set forth _ARTICLE VIII_.

 



 

6.4.1. _Seller s Responsibility_.

 



 

(a) _Scope of Seller Responsibility_. Subject to the provisions of this
_ARTICLE VI_, Seller shall diligently perform, at its sole cost:

 



 

(i) any Ongoing Corrective Action at a Real Property listed on _Section
6.2.1_ of the Disclosure Schedule;

 



 

(ii) any Corrective Action at or relating to each Real Property (A) listed on
_Section 6.2.3_, _Section 6.2.4_ or _Section 6.2.5_ of the Disclosure
Schedule at which a

 



      
 

 



 

Release is identified in a Buyer Environmental Investigation, in each case,
that (x) is reportable to a Responsible Government Agency as a Release
pursuant to _Section 6.3.1(c)_ and (y) discovered by or disclosed to Seller
prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 6.3.1_;

 



 

(iii) any Corrective Action to address a Release that occurs as a result of
Corrective Action by or on behalf of Seller at a Property after the Closing
Date but excluding any Property listed on _Section 6.2.2_ of the Disclosure
Schedule; and

 



 

(iv) all UST Repair Actions at any Real Property (other than any Excluded
Property) which are identified in a Tank Integrity Test Report and for which
Seller has elected to be Responsible by pursuing UST Option (1).

 



 

Other than as expressly set forth in this _Section 6.4.1(a)_, Seller shall
not be responsible for any Corrective Action or UST Repair Action at any of
the Properties after Closing, including performing Corrective Action for a
Release discovered after Closing for which Seller does not have responsibility
prior to Closing.

 



 

(b) _Limitations on Seller s Corrective Action Responsibility_. With respect
to any Corrective Action for which Seller is responsible pursuant to this
Agreement, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue NFA
Status. Seller shall be permitted to utilize any reasonable method or approach
to pursue and obtain NFA Status, including, natural attenuation and
Engineering and Institutional Controls. Buyer-Related Parties shall cooperate
with Seller in obtaining NFA Status, including implementing any Engineering
and Institutional Controls to obtain NFA Status and coordinating with any
applicable Responsible Government Agency to execute, file and record any deed
notice, restriction or similar restrictive covenant in the County recorders
records for a Property, to the extent such deed notice, restriction or
restrictive covenant is proposed by Seller. Except to the extent required by
applicable Environmental Laws, the Buyer-Related Parties shall not communicate
with any Responsible Government Agency concerning the necessity for Corrective
Action at any Real Property, or contest, challenge or appeal any particular
decision, standard or determination of any such agency, without the prior
written consent of Seller. In no event shall Sellers obligations under this
Section require any Corrective Action to achieve a cleanup standard higher
than necessary for use of the Property for the storage, sale, and dispensing
of Fuel. Buyer-Related Parties acknowledge that Corrective Action that results
in NFA Status may allow for the continued presence of Hazardous Substances on,
under or emanating to or from a Property. Sellers obligation under this
_Section 6.4.1_ shall be based only on Environmental Laws existing as of the
Closing Date. Nothing in this Section shall prejudice the right of Seller to
contest, challenge or appeal any particular decision, standard or
determination of any Responsible Government Agency or limit Sellers right to
pursue or obtain NFA Status based on any practicable approach. With respect to
any particular Release for which the Seller is responsible pursuant to this
Agreement, Sellers obligation under this _Section 6.4.1_ and _Section 8.1_
shall terminate upon the securing of NFA Status. This Agreement shall not
affect any indemnity protection or other contract rights that Seller may have
from or against prior owners or third parties who may be responsible for
Releases or Corrective Action.

 



 

6.4.2. _Buyer s Responsibility_. Buyer shall be responsible for performing,
at its

 



      
 

 



 

sole cost, all Corrective Action and UST Repair Action at the Properties
(other than Excluded Properties) other than Corrective Action to be performed
by Seller pursuant to _Section 6.4.1_. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer
shall be Responsible for all costs of Corrective Action resulting from a
Release that occurs after the Closing Date other than a Release caused by
Seller in connection with performing Corrective Action or UST Repair Action.

 



 

6.5 _Seller s Right to Remove Properties from Agreement._

 



 

(a) As to any Real Property where (i) the Buyer Environmental Consultant has
identified a Release during any Buyer Environmental Investigation for which
Seller is Responsible pursuant to _Section 6.4.1(a)(ii)_, or (ii) a Tank
Integrity Inspection Report indicates there exists a UST Defective Condition,
Seller shall obtain an estimate, using the environmental consultant of its
choice (the " _Seller Environmental Consultant_ "), for the total cost of (i)
the Corrective Action necessary to secure NFA Status for each such Real
Property (the " _Corrective Action Cost Estimate_ ") and/or (ii) all required
UST Repair Action for each Real Property (the " _UST Repair Action Cost
Estimate_ ") (collectively, and as it may be adjusted by the results of any
dispute resolution process under _Section 6.3.2_, the " _Environmental Action
Cost Estimate_ "). Buyer shall deposit, on behalf of Seller, the aggregate of
all Environmental Action Cost Estimates for each such Real Property, other
than (A) Excluded Properties and (B) Environmental Action Cost Estimates in
respect of (x) any UST Repair Action for which Seller has elected to pursue
UST Option (2), or (y) any Real Property that Buyer has elected to be
Responsible for in accordance with _Section 6.5(c)_, in each case, in the
Environmental Escrow Account on the Closing Date in accordance with _Section
2.4(b)(vii)_.

 



 

(b) If (i) the Inspection Report indicates that the estimated cost to correct
all of the Defective Conditions at (A) any individual Real Property (other
than any Terminal Property) is equal to or exceeds the Station Correction Cost
Cap, or (B) any Terminal Property is equal to or exceeds the Terminal
Correction Cost Cap or (ii) the Environmental Action Cost Estimate for (A) any
individual Real Property (other than any Terminal Property) is equal to or
exceeds the Station Removal Threshold, or (B) any Terminal Property is equal
to or exceeds the Terminal Removal Threshold, Seller can, in each case, elect
to designate such Real Property as an Excluded Property by providing Buyer
with a Removal Notice not less than twelve (12) Business Days prior to
Closing, transfer the same to a Transferee and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced in accordance with _Schedule 6.5(b)_. If the Excluded Properties
would, on a combined basis (including any Excluded Properties designated
pursuant to _Section 6.16_), result in an aggregate purchase price credit to
Buyer of ten percent (10%) or more of the Initial Enterprise Value, Buyer may
elect, not more than five (5) Business Days after receipt of the applicable
Removal Notice causing such ten percent (10%) threshold to be equaled or
exceeded, to terminate this Agreement without liability to Seller, except for
those obligations that survive termination, including indemnification as
provided for in _Section 6.7_. In the event that the foregoing termination
option conditions are met and Buyer elects to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the preceding sentence, prior to any such termination, Seller
shall have the option, to be exercised within five (5) Business Days after
receipt of Buyers election to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 9.1(g)_ (but in no event less than two (2) Business Days prior to
Closing), to reinstate this Agreement by removing such Real Property from the
list of Excluded Properties, until the ten percent (10%) Initial Enterprise
Value threshold is no longer equaled or exceeded; provided, however, that
concurrently with such reinstatement notice, and

 



      
 

 



 

as a condition to the reinstatement of this Agreement, Seller shall notify
Buyer in writing (x) with respect to any Defective Condition, whether Seller
has elected to proceed under Option (1) or Option (2), (y) with respect to any
UST Defective Condition, whether Seller has elected to proceed under UST
Option (1) or UST Option (2) and (z) with respect to any Corrective Action
costs, that Seller is electing to be Responsible for payment of all Corrective
Action costs with respect to such previously removed Real Property.

 



 

(c) Within five (5) Business Days following receipt of such Removal Notice,
Buyer may by written notice to Seller elect, (i) with respect to any Defective
Conditions, to be Responsible, at its sole cost, for the amount by which the
cost to correct the Defective Conditions for such Property exceeds the Station
Correction Cost Cap for such Property (or, with respect to any Terminal
Property, the Terminal Correction Cost Cap), and (ii) with respect to any
Corrective Action and/or UST Repair Action, to be Responsible for the payment
of all Corrective Action costs and/or UST Repair Action costs in excess of the
Station Removal Threshold (or, with respect to any Terminal Property, the
Terminal Removal Threshold). Buyers failure to so notify Seller within such
five (5) Business Day period shall be deemed to be Buyers election to allow
Seller to designate such Property as an Excluded Property and transfer
ownership of such Property to a Transferee as set forth _Section 6.5(b)_. In
the event that Buyer chooses, as to any one or more Properties, not to permit
Seller to designate such Property as an Excluded Property and transfer
ownership of such Property, Seller shall credit Buyer at Closing (i) with
respect to any Defective Conditions, the amount of the Station Correction Cost
Cap for such Property (or, if such Property is a Terminal Property, the amount
of the Terminal Correction Cost Cap) and (ii) with respect to any Corrective
Action and/or UST Repair Action, the amount of the Station Removal Threshold
for such Property (or, if such Property is a Terminal Property, the amount of
the Terminal Removal Threshold), in which case Buyer shall (i) be Responsible
for all required costs to correct any such Defective Conditions and for the
cost of any such Corrective Action and/or UST Repair Action at such Real
Property, (ii) pay all costs to correct such Defective Conditions and all
costs of such Corrective Action and/or UST Repair Action and (iii) assume all
Responsibility for such Real Property. Seller shall retain Responsibility for
all costs to correct any Defective Conditions and all costs of Corrective
Action and UST Repair Action, if any, at any Excluded Property.

 



 

6.6 _Buyer s Notice and Disclosure Responsibility._ For a period of five (5)
years after the Closing Date, and thereafter for so long as Seller-Related
Parties are performing Corrective Action until NFA Status is obtained, the
Buyer-Related Parties shall be responsible to immediately notify Seller in
writing of any Release that occurs at a Property, and, upon Sellers request,
provide copies to Seller of all UST System records, Corrective Action
materials, and other documents relating to the Properties.

 



 

6.7 _Entry Onto Property._ Buyers Representatives shall assume all risks
involved in entering the Properties under this _ARTICLE VI_. Buyer and
Buyers Representatives acknowledge and agree that inspections and testing
pursuant to _Section 6.1_ shall not involve any invasive or destructive
testing of the Properties. Seller shall have the right and opportunity to be
present at all Buyer Inspections and Buyer Environmental Investigations. Buyer
and Buyers Representatives shall not visit any of the Properties without
Sellers written consent, nor shall they engage in conversations with
employees of the Company. Buyer agrees to use, and to cause Buyers
Representatives to use, reasonable care in conducting Buyer Inspections and

Environmental Investigations and upon completion return the Properties to
their condition immediately prior to such inspection. Buyer agrees to maintain
and cause any of Buyers Representatives entering upon any Property or
otherwise conducting any Buyer Inspections or Buyer Environmental
Investigation to maintain and have in effect commercial general liability
insurance with a per occurrence limit of at least Two Million Dollars
($2,000,000) and an aggregate limit of at least Five Million Dollars
($5,000,000). Such insurance shall name the Company as an additional insured,
shall be primary and non-contributing with any other insurance available to or
maintained by the Company and shall contain a full waiver of subrogation
clause. Buyer shall deliver to Seller a copy of the certificates of insurance
evidencing the insurance required hereunder prior to the commencement of any
Buyer Inspection or Buyer Environmental Investigation, which certificates
shall indicate that insurance coverage shall not be terminated or modified
without at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Seller. If any
mechanics or other lien is recorded against the Properties, as a result of
Buyers or Buyers Representatives activities on or inspection of the
Properties, Buyer shall be liable to pay the lien or post any bond necessary
to discharge the lien of record within fifteen (15) days after receiving
notice of the liens recording. Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold Seller and the Seller-Related Parties harmless from and against any and
all actions, claims, damages, liabilities, losses, costs and/or expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), if
any, arising from (a) injury to persons or damage to Property, (b) any liens
or claims of liens against the Property or any portions thereof, arising from
any Buyer Inspection or Buyer Environmental Investigation, (c) any
Environmental Liabilities caused by performance of any Buyer Inspection or
Buyer Environmental Investigation, and (d) any breach by Buyer or Buyers
Representative of this _Section 6.7_. The foregoing indemnity shall survive
the Closing and any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

6.8 _Post-Closing Access to Properties._ Upon notice by any Seller-Related
Party for any purpose, and in Sellers sole discretion, Buyer-Related Parties
shall provide for and permit, at no cost to Seller or any Seller-Related
Party, post-Closing access to the Properties, including, without limitation,
access to utilities located on the Properties, as any of the Seller-Related
Parties may require, to undertake Corrective Action and Engineering and
Institutional Controls that the Seller-Related Party deems necessary, whether
or not related to an Ongoing Corrective Action or other Release for which the
Seller is responsible pursuant to this Agreement. Such access shall include,
but is not limited to, the right but not the obligation to conduct Corrective
Action, UST Repair Action, remove Sellers Corrective Action Equipment and
undertake such other actions as are reasonably necessary pursuant to such
request. The Seller-Related Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize disruption of the business activities at the Properties. The Seller-
Related Party shall provide Buyer with as much advance notice as reasonably
practical of all potentially disruptive or intrusive activities to be
undertaken; such notice may be in the form of a periodic written schedule of
activities delivered from time to time. Advance notice shall not be required
for non-disruptive activities such as periodic monitoring of wells on the
Properties, if any. Buyer shall refrain from conducting any operations that
unreasonably interfere with Corrective Action. In the event Seller is not
granted access to a Property, Sellers obligation to perform Corrective Action
or UST Repair Action, as applicable, shall be suspended until access is
allowed or terminated if access is not allowed for sixty (60) days.

 



      
 

 



 

6.9 _Future Use of the Properties._ Buyer and Seller acknowledge that some of
the Properties are and will be subject to Engineering and Institutional
Controls imposed in connection with previous, ongoing and future Corrective
Action at the Properties, including, without limitation, as specifically set
forth in the deeds to the Properties. Buyer-Related Parties shall maintain,
preserve, and comply with all Engineering and Institutional Controls that are
or may be in the future imposed on the Properties in connection with
Corrective Action conducted by the Seller. The Engineering and Institutional
Controls shall run with the land for the benefit of the Seller-Related Parties
and bind the Buyer-Related Parties, subsequent owners, users and occupiers of
the Properties, including any successors, lessees, assignees and licensees,
and shall continue until released by the applicable Responsible Government
Agency. Buyer-Related Parties, for themselves and their permitted successors
and assigns, covenant and agree that they shall not install, and shall not
authorize any tenant or user of the Properties to install, any well or
underground tank, pump or related equipment for the underground storage or
production of potable water at any of the Properties. Buyer-Related Parties
shall not materially change the use of any of the Properties in such a way as
to materially increase the level of clean-up required by any Responsible
Government Agency for any Corrective Action for which Seller is responsible
except at their sole cost and expense. Buyer-Related Parties acknowledge that
acceptable Corrective Action by Seller that results in obtaining NFA Status
may allow for the continued presence of Hazardous Substances on, under or
emanating to or from a Property. The presence of Hazardous Substances may
increase the cost, or make impossible or impractical, certain future uses or
development of a Property. Buyer-Related Parties shall be solely responsible
for any costs or damages, including increased development costs or diminution
in value, caused by such continued presence of Hazardous Substances.

 



 

6.10 _Subsequent Transfers._ The provisions of _Sections 6.8_ and _6.9_ shall
run with the land and be recorded or, in the case of Engineering and
Institutional Controls, such other recordable instrument as provided by
applicable Environmental Law and/or Responsible Government Agency. Buyer-
Related Parties shall include provisions in all such documents, giving Seller,
and Sellers successors and assigns, the right, but not the obligation, to
enforce such obligations against Buyer-Related Parties, subsequent owners,
users, and occupiers of the Properties, including any successors, lessees,
assignees, and licensees. Seller also may enforce any such obligations by all
lawful means including specific performance, injunctive relief, any other
legal or equitable remedy allowed by law against Buyer, notwithstanding the
subsequent transfer, lease, or mortgage of the Properties or part thereof,
and, in any event, Buyer shall remain liable to Seller for any breach of this
_Section 6.10_. Any transferee, assignee or successor owner, lessee,
licensee, occupier or user of the Properties shall only take title to the
Properties subject to the terms of _Sections 6.8_ and _6.9_. The rights and
benefits of _Sections 6.8_ and _6.9_ shall inure not only to Seller, but also
to the benefit of the Seller-Related Parties. Neither Buyer, nor any party
acquiring any right, interest or title through or after Buyer will be
permitted to vacate, waive, eliminate, or in any way modify the rights and
benefits that the Seller-Related Parties have pursuant to _Sections 6.8_ and
_6.9_. Any subsequent transfer of any Property will not alter Buyers
responsibilities and obligations to Seller under this Agreement.

 



 

6.11 _Seller s Corrective Action Equipment._ From and after the Closing Date,
Seller-Related Parties shall at all times have unrestricted access to any
Corrective Action Equipment located on or about the Properties, whether

Corrective Action pursuant to this Agreement. After the Closing Date,

 



      
 

 



 

Seller-Related Parties shall have the right to install Corrective Action
Equipment at any of the Properties for the purposes of performing Corrective
Action pursuant to this Agreement. Seller-Related Parties shall retain all
legal rights, including ownerships rights, to Corrective Action Equipment
installed by Seller-Related Parties after the Closing Date, and Buyer shall
have no title or right to such Corrective Action Equipment. Buyer-Related
Parties shall be not be permitted to interfere with any Corrective Action
Equipment being used by Seller-Related Parties and shall be responsible for
any damage caused to any Corrective Action Equipment due to the activities of
Buyer-Related Parties or their agents or invitees. Seller-Related Parties
shall have the right to destroy, remove or abandon-in-place any Corrective
Action Equipment being used by Seller-Related Parties in compliance with
Environmental Law. Seller shall have no responsibility for any Corrective
Action Equipment upon any removal, abandonment or destruction of such
equipment. If any of the Corrective Action Equipment being used by a Seller-
Related Party becomes damaged by any Buyer-Related Party, including, but not
limited to, any damage as a result of any construction or redevelopment at the
Properties, Buyer shall immediately notify Seller of the existence of such
condition and shall compensate Seller for the cost of proper abandonment,
relocation, replacement and/or repair of the Corrective Action Equipment.

 



 

6.12 _Buyer Modifications to Properties._ Buyer acknowledges that any
construction, redevelopment or other modification at a Property may affect
Sellers Corrective Action at that Property. Prior to any excavation,
construction or other activity at any Property where Seller is conducting or
are responsible for Corrective Action, Buyer-Related Parties shall give Seller
prior written notice of any such activities and permit Seller the full, timely
and reasonable opportunity at the Sellers option to: (a) change the location
of or remove Corrective Action Equipment and install new equipment at
locations on the Property mutually agreeable to the Parties; and (b) close any
affected monitoring or extraction wells in accordance with the requirements of
applicable Environmental Laws. The costs of such work shall be at the Buyer-
Related Parties sole expense. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any and
all costs of off-site transportation and disposal, discharge or recycling of

the Company to deposit into the Environmental Escrow Account, the amount of
such insurance proceeds, to the extent available, equal to the excess of (i)

claim by a third party. Within thirty (30) days after delivery of such
notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the
Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such action, suit,
proceeding or claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The Party not controlling such
defense may participate therein at its own expense; provided that if the
Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified Party
reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to
such action, suit, proceeding or claim, the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith shall be
considered "Damages" for purposes of this Agreement; provided, however, that
in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be responsible for the fees and
expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties. The Party
controlling such defense shall keep the other Party advised of the status of
such action, suit, proceeding or claim and the defense thereof and shall
consider recommendations made by the other Party with respect thereto. The
Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such action, suit,
proceeding or claim that does not include a complete release of the
Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto or that imposes any
liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to
any settlement of such action, suit, proceeding or claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in the conduct of the defense of a third
party claim, including by retaining records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such third party claim and providing reasonable access
to each others relevant business records and other documents, and employees.
The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent
with applicable law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel
and others representing any party to a third party claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges. To the
extent any provision in this _Section 8.3(a)_ conflicts with the provisions
of _Section 10.4_, _Section 10.4_ shall control.

 



 

(b) _Procedure for Other Claims_. An Indemnified Party wishing to assert a
claim for indemnification under this _ARTICLE VIII_ which is not subject to

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 8.3(a)_ shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (a
" _Claim Notice_ ") which contains (i) a description and the amount (the "
_Claimed Amount_ ") of any Damages incurred by the Indemnified Party, (ii) a
statement that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this
_ARTICLE VIII_ and a reasonable explanation of the basis therefor, and (iii)
a demand for payment in the amount of such Damages. Within thirty (30) days
after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the
Indemnified Party a written response in which the Indemnifying Party shall:
(x) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed
Amount (in which case such response shall be accompanied by a written notice
by the Indemnifying Party to the Escrow Agent authorizing disbursement of the
Claimed Amount from the General Escrow Account to Buyer, or a written notice
by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the Claimed Amount, by
check or by wire transfer, as applicable), (y) agree that the Indemnified
Party is entitled to receive part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount (the "
_Agreed Amount_ ") (in which case such response shall be accompanied by a
written notice by the Indemnifying Party to the Escrow Agent authorizing
disbursement of the Agreed Amount from the General Escrow Account to Buyer, or
a written notice by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the
Claimed Amount, by check or by wire transfer, as applicable), or (z) contest
that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed Amount.
If the Indemnifying Party in such response contests the payment of all or part
of the Claimed Amount, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
use good faith efforts to resolve such dispute. If such dispute is not
resolved within sixty (60) days following the delivery by the Indemnifying
Party of such response, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
each have the right to submit such dispute for resolution in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 11.9_.

 



 

(c) _Procedure for Specified Action_.

 



 

(i) Seller shall, with attorneys selected by Seller, continue to control the
defense of the Specified Action at its sole cost and expense and shall keep
Buyer reasonably advised of the status of the Specified Action and the defense
thereof. Seller shall not agree to any settlement of the Specified Action that
imposes any non-monetary liability or obligation (other than the Buyer
Specified Liability) on Buyer or any Buyer-Related Party without the prior
written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(ii) Following the Closing, and without limitation of Buyers obligations
pursuant to _Section 5.3_, Buyer shall cooperate with Sellers conduct of the
defense of the Specified Action, including by retaining records and
information that are reasonably relevant to the Specified Action and providing
reasonable access to the relevant business records and other documents, and
employees; provided that Seller shall reimburse Buyer for any out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred in providing such cooperation. Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid production of confidential
information (consistent with applicable Law), and to cause all communications
among employees, counsel and others representing any party to a third party
claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work
product privileges.

 



 

(iii) If, following the Closing, the Company pursues a claim against Shell
relating to the Specified Action or the Buyer Specified Liability, Buyer shall
cause

 



      
 

 



 

the Company to remit to Seller any payment that the Company receives from
Shell to the extent related to the Specified Action (net of any unreimbursed
costs, expenses and other Damages incurred by Buyer in respect of this
_Section 8.3(c)_) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Seller, within three (3) business days after receipt of
any payments from Shell; provided that any payment received by the Company
from Shell in respect of the Buyer Specified Liability will be for the
Companys account and will not be remitted to Seller.

 



 

8.4 _Survival._

 



 

(a) The (i) representations and warranties of Seller and Buyer set forth in
this Agreement and (ii) certificates delivered at Closing, pursuant to
_Sections 7.1(c)_ and _7.2(c)_ , shall both survive the Closing and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and continue through for
a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, at which time they
shall expire. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the respective
representations and warranties (the " _Fundamental Representations_ ") of
Seller contained in _Sections 3.1.1(a)_ , _3.1.2(a)_ , _3.1.3_ and _3.1.19_
and the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in _Sections 4.1_,
_4.2_ and _4.4_ shall survive the Closing for a period of two (2) years
following the Closing, (ii) the representations and warranties of Seller set
forth in _Section 3.1.8_ shall survive the Closing through the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations, at which time they shall expire and
(iii) except as otherwise provided in _Sections 6.14_ and _8.5(g)_ , the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.2_ shall survive the
Closing until the second anniversary of the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) None of the covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing Date other than those which by their terms
contemplate performance after the Closing Date, and each such surviving
covenant and agreement shall survive the Closing only until the expiration of
the term of the undertaking set forth in such agreement and covenant.

 



 

(c) No Party shall have any liability or obligation of any nature with respect
to any representation, warranty or covenant after the termination thereof. By
way of example only, Seller shall have no liability or obligation, including
without limitation, any indemnity obligation pertaining to any third party
claim, relating to any Release after NFA Status has been obtained for such
Release.

 



 

(d) Any valid claim that is properly asserted in writing pursuant to _Section
8.3_ prior to the expiration as provided in _Section 8.4(a)_ of the
representation or warranty that is the basis for such claim shall survive
until such claim is finally resolved and satisfied.

 



 

8.5 _Limitations._

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, (i) the rights of Buyer and Seller under
_ARTICLE X_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer and Seller with
respect to the subject matter of _ARTICLE X_, (ii) to the extent of any
inconsistencies with this _ARTICLE VIII_ and _ARTICLE VI_, with respect to
Environmental Liabilities and required Corrective Action and UST Repair
Action, the rights of Buyer and Seller under _ARTICLE VI_ shall control;

 



      
 

 



 

and to the extent of any inconsistencies with this _ARTICLE VIII_ and
_Section 6.1_ with respect to physical inspections of the Properties, the
rights of Buyer and Seller under _Section 6.1_ shall control. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, from and after the Closing, the rights of
the Indemnified Parties under this _ARTICLE VIII_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedies of the Indemnified Parties and their respective Affiliates
with respect to claims resulting from any breach of representation or warranty
or failure to perform any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
otherwise relating to the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing two (2) sentences, in no
event shall Buyer or its successors or permitted assigns be entitled to claim
or seek rescission of the transactions consummated under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the following limitations shall apply:

 



 

(i) the aggregate liability of the Seller for all Damages under this _ARTICLE
VIII_ shall be limited to the General Escrow Amount then held for the benefit
of Seller in the General Escrow Account and shall be payable solely from the
General Escrow Amount then held in the General Escrow Account in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement, and Buyer agrees that the General Escrow Amount
then remaining in the General Escrow Account shall serve as the sole and
exclusive source of payment of any claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, except for (A) Damages for breaches or inaccuracies of any
Fundamental Representation of Seller, which shall be limited to the Purchase
Price, (B) Damages for which Buyer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)_ for breaches of the covenants or agreements of Seller set
forth in _ARTICLE X_, which shall be limited to the Purchase Price, and (C)
Damages for which Buyer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(e)_, which, in each case, shall not be subject to any
monetary limitation.

 



 

(ii) other than with respect to any claim for breach of any Fundamental
Representation, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_ for any one claim unless and
until the amount of Damages incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties that are
the subject of the claim exceeds $50,000 (the " _Per-Claim Basket_ "), and the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to _Section 8.1(a)_ to the extent the aggregate amount of all Damages
incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties for which the Buyer Indemnified
Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_
(excluding amounts below the applicable Per-Claim Basket) exceeds 0.5% of the
Purchase Price (the " _Basket Amount_ "), and the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall only be entitled to indemnification for such Damages to the extent such
Damages exceed the Basket Amount;

 



 

(iii) no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to make any claim for
indemnification, or recover Damages, with respect to any matter to the extent
that the specific matter giving rise to such Damages and the amount of such
Damages was included as a liability for purposes of determining the Final
Closing Working Capital, Final Closing Cash and Final Closing Debt, pursuant
to _Section 2.5_, and the amount of any Damages for which indemnification is
provided under this _ARTICLE VIII_ or under _ARTICLE X_, shall be calculated
net of any such liability reflected in the Final Closing Statement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be responsible or liable for any
(i) special, punitive or exemplary damages, (ii) any loss of enterprise value,
diminution in value of any business, damage to reputation or loss of goodwill,
or (iii) any lost profits, consequential, indirect or incidental damages.
Buyer shall (and shall cause the Business to) use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue all legal rights and remedies available in order to minimize
the Damages for which indemnification is provided to Buyer by Seller under
this _ARTICLE VIII_. In determining the amount of any Damages, no adjustment
shall be made as a result of any multiple of earnings or any other premium
over fair market value, book or historical value which may have been paid by
Buyer, whether or not any such multiple of earnings or other premium had been
used by Buyer in connection with its calculation of the Purchase Price
hereunder.

 



 

(d) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under this
_ARTICLE VIII_ shall be reduced by any related recoveries to which the
Indemnified Party is entitled under insurance policies or other related
payments received or receivable from third parties and any Tax benefits
available to the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or for which the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates is eligible on account of the
matter resulting in such Damages or the payment of such Damages. An
Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue, and to
cause its Affiliates to pursue, all insurance claims and Tax benefits to which
it may be entitled in connection with any Damages it incurs, and each of
Buyer, Seller and the Indemnified Parties with respect to any indemnification
claim shall cooperate with each other in pursuing insurance claims with
respect to any Damages or any indemnification obligations with respect to
Damages. If an Indemnified Party receives any insurance payment or Tax benefit
in connection with any claim for Damages for which it has already received an
indemnification payment from the Indemnifying Party, it shall deposit in the
Escrow Account, within ten (10) days of receiving such insurance payment or
Tax benefit, an amount equal to the excess of (i) the amount previously
received by the Indemnified Party under this _ARTICLE VIII_ with respect to
such claim plus the amount of the insurance payments or Tax benefit received,
over (ii) the amount of Damages with respect to such claim which the
Indemnified Party has become entitled to receive under this _ARTICLE VIII_.

 



 

(e) Subject to the limitations in this _Section 8.5_, any indemnification
owed by Seller to Buyer under this _ARTICLE VIII_ shall first be satisfied
out of the General Escrow Account to the extent any funds remain in the
General Escrow Account. Buyer and Seller shall promptly execute and deliver
the necessary documents instructing the Escrow Agent to make any payment
required to be made from the General Escrow Account as set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

(f) Buyer and Seller agree that in the event of any breach giving rise to an
indemnification obligation under this _ARTICLE VIII_, the Indemnified Party,
at the sole cost and expense of such Indemnifying Party, shall and shall cause
its Affiliates to reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and to take
all reasonable measures requested by such Indemnifying Party to mitigate the
consequences of the related breach (including taking steps to prevent any
contingent liability from becoming an actual liability). Any liability for
indemnification hereunder shall be determined without duplication of recovery
by reason of the

 



      
 

 



 

state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more
than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 



 

(g) Corrective Action, UST Repair Action and Environmental Claims for which
post-Closing Responsibility is specifically allocated to any Seller-Related
Party pursuant to _ARTICLE VI_ shall not be made the subject of a claim for
indemnification under (i) _Section 8.1(a)_ for breach of representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 3.2_ or (ii) _Section 8.1(d)_.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Buyer Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_
for any Damages resulting from, or relating or attributable to, (i) any Taxes
incurred in any Post-Closing Tax Period or (ii) any Tax attribute of the
Company, including but not limited to any net operating loss, any net
operating loss carryover, any Tax credit, any Tax credit carryover or any
other Tax attribute of the Company which may be affected in any way by the
acquisition of control under applicable Law, or the determination that any
such Tax attribute is subject to any limitation on its use under applicable
Law.

to the Closing as provided below:

 



 

(a) the Parties may terminate this Agreement by mutual written consent;

 



 

(b) Buyer may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to Seller
if there is any material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Seller set forth in this Agreement, such that the
conditions specified in _Section 7.1(a)_ or _Section 7.1(b)_ would not be
satisfied at the Closing (a " _Terminating Seller Breach_ "), except that, if
such Terminating Seller Breach is curable by the Seller through the exercise
of its reasonable best efforts, then, for a period of up to thirty (30) days
after receipt by the Seller of notice from Buyer of such breach, but only as
long as the Seller continues to use its reasonable best efforts to cure such
Terminating Seller Breach (the " _Seller Cure Period_ "), such termination
shall not be effective, and such termination shall become effective only if
the Terminating Seller Breach is not cured within the Seller Cure Period;

 



 

(c) Seller may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to Buyer
if there is any material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this Agreement, such that the
conditions specified in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ would not be
satisfied at the Closing (a " _Terminating Buyer Breach_ "), except that, if
any such Terminating Buyer Breach is curable by Buyer through the exercise of
its reasonable best efforts, then, for a period of up to thirty (30) days
after receipt by Buyer of notice from the Company of such breach, but only as
long as Buyer continues to exercise such reasonable best efforts to cure such
Terminating Buyer Breach (the " _Buyer Cure Period_ "), such termination shall
not be effective, and such termination shall become effective only if the
Terminating Buyer Breach is not cured within the Buyer Cure Period;

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Buyer or Seller may terminate this Agreement if the consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated hereby is permanently enjoined, prohibited or
otherwise restrained by the terms of a final, non-appealable order or judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction; or

 



 

(e) Buyer or Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to
the other if the Closing shall not have occurred by the Outside Date by reason
of the failure of any condition precedent under _Section 7.1_ or _Section
7.2_ hereof;

 



 

(f) Buyer may terminate this Agreement within fifteen (15) days following
delivery by Seller to Buyer of an update to the Disclosure Schedule pursuant
to _Section 5.5(b)_ which contains new disclosure of any event or development
that would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;
and

 



 

(g) Buyer may terminate this Agreement, as provided in _Section 6.5(b)_, if
the aggregate purchase price credits provided in respect of all Excluded
Properties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement equal or exceed 10% of the
Initial Enterprise Value; provided that, prior to the effectiveness of any
termination under this _Section 9.1(g)_, Seller may, in accordance with the

9.1(g)_) un-designate any of those Real Properties that was properly
designated an Excluded Property, until the 10% Initial Enterprise Value
threshold is no longer equaled or exceeded, in which case such termination
shall be rescinded.

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party may terminate this Agreement pursuant
to clauses (b) through (e) of this _Section 9.1_ if the basis for termination
results from a material breach by such Party of any of its agreements or
covenants contained in this Agreement, including any breach by Buyer of its
obligations pursuant to _Section 5.1_.

 



 

9.2 _Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall immediately become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of any of the Parties or
their respective officers, directors or Affiliates arising from this
Agreement, other than liability of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, for
any intentional and willful breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such
termination; provided that the provisions of _Section 6.7_ with respect to
Buyers indemnification obligations, this _Section 9.2_ and _ARTICLE XI_ of
this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect and survive the termination of this Agreement. In determining
losses or damages recoverable upon termination by a Party for the other
Partys breach, the Parties acknowledge and agree that such losses and damages
shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and
shall include the benefit of the bargain lost by such Party (taking into
consideration, in the case of Seller, other opportunities and the time value
of money), which shall be deemed to be damages payable to such Party. Nothing
shall limit or prevent any Party from exercising any rights or remedies it may
have under this Agreement in lieu of terminating this Agreement pursuant to
this _ARTICLE IX_, including the rights or remedies of the Parties under
_Section 11.10_ of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE X 
TAX MATTERS**

 



 

10.1 _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes._

 



 

(a) Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and timely filing, in a
manner consistent with past practices of the Company, of all Tax Returns of
the Company for any Straddle Periods and Tax Returns that relate to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall make all payments required with respect to any
such Tax Returns and shall be responsible for the payment of all Taxes
attributable to such periods; provided, however, that except to the extent
such Taxes are taken into account in determining Final Closing Working
Capital, Seller shall be responsible for such Taxes to the extent attributable
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (allocated as to Straddle Periods in accordance
with _Section 10.3_) and shall promptly reimburse Buyer for the amount of any
such Taxes paid by Buyer in connection with the filing of such Tax Returns. If
Seller may be liable under this Agreement for any Taxes due with respect to a
Tax Return prepared by Buyer, Buyer shall submit such Tax Return and such
additional information regarding such Tax Return as reasonably requested by
Seller, to Seller for Sellers review, comment and approval, such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, at least 30 days prior to
the due date of such Tax Return (including any applicable extensions) and
Buyer shall revise such Tax Return to reflect any reasonable comments made by
Seller prior to the filing of such Tax Return.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of any transfer, sales, use,
stamp, conveyance, value added, recording, registration, documentary, filing
and other non-income Taxes and administrative fees (including notary fees)
arising in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



 

10.2 _Refunds._ Any Tax refund, credit or similar benefit (including any
interest paid or credited by a Taxing Authority with respect thereto), net of
applicable Taxes incurred by Buyer, the Company, or any Subsidiary thereof
with respect to such refund, relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (a " _Tax
Refund_ ") shall be for the benefit of Seller. Buyer shall pay or cause to be
paid to Seller any such Tax Refund within 15 days of receipt of such Tax
Refund or the filing of any Tax Return utilizing such Tax Refund (in the form
of a credit or offset to Taxes otherwise payable), as the case may be. The
parties hereto agree that Tax Refunds for the portion of a Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date shall be determined using the methodologies set
forth in _Section 10.3_. Upon the request of the Seller, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall, and shall cause the Company to promptly take all actions
(including those actions reasonably requested by the Seller) to file for and
obtain any Tax refund, credit or similar benefit that would give rise to a Tax
Refund, to the extent the filing of such Tax Refund does not increase any
Taxes owed in a Post-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period.

 



 

10.3 _Allocation of Taxes._ For purposes of determining the allocation of
Taxes for a Straddle Period of the Company, the portion of any Taxes that are
payable for such Straddle Period and relate to the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date shall (a) in the case of ad valorem or
property Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period and (b) in the case of any
other Tax, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable computed on a
closing of the books basis as if the relevant taxable period ended as of the
close of business on the Closing Date.

 



       
 

 



 

10.4 _Cooperation on Tax Matters; Tax Audits._

 



 

(a) Buyer and Seller and their respective Affiliates shall cooperate in the
preparation of all Tax Returns for any Tax periods for which any such party
could reasonably require the assistance of another such party in obtaining any
necessary information. Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited to,
furnishing prior years Tax Returns or return preparation packages to the
extent related to the Company illustrating previous reporting practices or
containing historical information relevant to the preparation of such Tax
Returns, and furnishing such other information within such partys possession
requested by the party filing such Tax Returns as is relevant to their
preparation. Such cooperation shall include promptly forwarding, within 15
calendar days of receipt or sending, copies of notices and forms or other
communications received from or sent to any Taxing Authority which relate to
the Company, and providing copies of any relevant Tax Returns to the extent
related to the Company, together with accompanying schedules and related work
papers, documents relating to rulings or other determinations by any Taxing
Authority, which are reasonably requested. Buyer and Seller and their
respective Affiliates shall make their respective employees and facilities
available on a mutually convenient basis to explain any documents or
information provided hereunder.

 



 

(b) Seller shall have the right, at its own expense, to control the conduct of
any Tax Audit for any Pre-Closing Tax Period with respect to the Company to
the extent Seller could be required to make any payment in respect of such
Taxes pursuant to _Section 8.1_ herein; provided that Seller shall keep Buyer
informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such Tax Audit,
Buyer shall be entitled at its expense to participate in such Tax Audit, and
Seller shall not compromise or settle any such Tax Audit without obtaining
Buyers prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). If Seller fails to notify Buyer in writing
of its intent to control the conduct of any such Tax Audit within 30 days of
receiving notice, then Buyer shall thereafter control the conduct of such Tax
Audit and shall keep Seller informed regarding the progress and substantive
aspects of such Tax Audit, Seller shall be entitled to participate in such Tax
Audit at its own expense, and Buyer shall not compromise or settle any such
Tax Audit without obtaining Sellers prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

10.5 _Post-Closing Tax Actions._ Except as otherwise required by Law, Buyer
shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) cause or permit any of Buyer,
its Affiliates or the Company (i) make any election or deemed election under
Section 338 of the Code (or any analogous or similar rules in any relevant
jurisdiction) for the Company, (ii) file or amend any Tax Return of the
Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) initiate any
communication with any Taxing Authority regarding Taxes of the Company with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (iv) engage in any transaction on
the Closing Date that is outside the ordinary course of business (except for
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), that may result in any increased
Tax liability for which Seller would be required to provide indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

11.1 _Press Releases and Announcements._ No Party shall issue (and each Party
shall cause its Affiliates not to issue) any press release or public
disclosure relating to the subject matter of this Agreement without the prior
written approval of the other Party; provided, however, that any Party may
make any public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by law,
regulation or stock exchange rule (in which case the disclosing Party shall
advise the other Party and the other Party shall, if practicable, have the
right to review such press release or announcement prior to its publication).

 



 

11.2 _No Third Party Beneficiaries._ Except as provided by applicable law or
otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement shall not confer any
rights or remedies upon any Person (including any Business Employees) other
than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns and, to
the extent specified herein, their respective Affiliates; provided, however,
that the provisions of _Sections 6.7_ and _6.14_ , _ARTICLE VIII_, _ARTICLE
X_ and _Section 5.4_ are intended for the benefit of the entities and
individuals specified therein and their respective legal representatives,
successors and assigns.

 



 

11.3 _Action to be Taken by Affiliates._ The Parties shall cause their
respective Affiliates to comply with all of the obligations specified in this
Agreement to be performed by such Affiliates. Prior to the Closing, the
Company will be deemed, for purposes of this Agreement, to be both an
Affiliate and a Subsidiary of Seller and not of Buyer. Following the Closing,
the Company will be deemed, for purposes of this Agreement, to be both an
Affiliate and a Subsidiary of Buyer and not of Seller.

 



 

11.4 _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement, the documents to be executed in
connection with the Closing and otherwise contemplated hereby, as well as the
Confidentiality Agreement between Seller and Buyer dated April 9, 2014 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), constitute the entire agreement by and between
Buyer and Seller. This Agreement supersedes any prior agreements or
representations by or between Buyer and Seller, whether written or oral, with
respect to the subject matter hereof (other than the Confidentiality
Agreement).

 



 

11.5 _Succession and Assignment._ This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement or
any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior
written approval of the other Party in its sole discretion; provided that
Buyer may assign its right to purchase the Shares from Seller to one of its

11.9 _Governing Law; Dispute Resolution; Consent to Jurisdiction._

 



 

(a) _Governing Law_. The Parties agree that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein and all disputes between the Parties under or
related to this Agreement or the facts and circumstances leading to its
execution or performance, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, will be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Hawaii,
without giving effect to its conflicts of law rules.

 



 

(b) _Arbitration_. Except as provided in _Section 11.10_, _ARTICLE II_ or
_ARTICLE VI_ of this Agreement, the Parties agree that all Disputes shall be
resolved in accordance with the following provisions:

 



 

(i) After reasonable notice of such Dispute, the Parties shall, in good faith,
use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the Dispute by meeting and
conferring.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) If the Parties are unable to resolve any Dispute by negotiation, pursuant
to paragraph (b)(i), within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of the
written notice of Dispute, the Parties shall engage in a binding arbitration
under the rules for commercial disputes, as promulgated by JAMS. The Parties
select arbitration using one arbitrator, to be either a retired JAMS judge or
a disinterested attorney, as the sole forum for the resolution of any dispute
between them. Such arbitration will be the sole and exclusive manner of
resolving any such Disputes, and the arbitrator shall have jurisdiction to
determine the validity of this Agreement and agreement to arbitrate in
addition to resolving any Disputes. Any fees and costs incurred by or payable
to the arbitrator shall be paid by the non-prevailing Party, as determined by
arbitration. The prevailing party or parties shall, in addition to such other
relief as may be awarded, be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees,
expenses and costs of investigation, including those incurred in appellate
proceedings, or establishing the right to indemnification.

 



 

(iii) The arbitration of the Dispute shall be heard and the arbitrator shall
issue his or her award within 180 Business Days from the appointment of the
arbitrator. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts and take all
necessary steps to ensure that the Dispute is resolved within the time period
set forth in this paragraph.

 



 

(iv) The arbitration of any Dispute shall be governed by the Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, _et seq._ The venue for arbitration shall be a
JAMS office in Chicago, Illinois. The arbitrator may make any interim order,
decision, determination, or award he deems necessary to preserve the status
quo until he is able to render a final order, decision, determination or
award. The determination by the arbitrator in such proceeding shall be
appealable only in accordance with the rules specified in _Section
11.9(b)(ii)_ above. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
entered into by any court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that any such arbitrator has the sole and exclusive jurisdiction to
interpret and enforce this Agreement and waive any and all objections as to
personal jurisdiction or venue in any of such courts.

 



 

(v) If prior to the appointment of an arbitrator any of the Parties desires to
obtain a preliminary injunction, temporary restraining order or similar
provisional judicial order or decree or otherwise exercise such Partys rights
pursuant to _Section 11.10_ of this Agreement, such Person may seek and
obtain such order or decree from any court of competent jurisdiction, but the
foregoing shall not limit or affect the application of this _Section 11.9(b)_
to all other matters, including any other relief sought by either party with
respect to the dispute or controversy giving rise to such judicial order or
decree.

 



 

(c) _Consent to Jurisdiction._ Any Dispute which is permitted to be brought in
court by the parties in accordance with _Section 11.10_ of this Agreement and
any Dispute brought for the purpose of confirming, challenging or vacating any
award rendered by an arbitrator in accordance with _Section 11.9(b)_ and
entering judgment thereon, shall be brought in any state or federal court of
competent subject matter jurisdiction situated in Los Angeles County,
California, and each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of
each such court in any such Dispute and waives any objection it may now or
hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of forum.
Each of the Parties irrevocably and

 



      
 

 



 

unconditionally consents to service of process in the manner provided for
notices in Section 11.8 of this Agreement.

 



 

11.10 _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur,
and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law, in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or otherwise, in
addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in
equity. Each party agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting
of any bond in connection with such remedy. The Parties further agree not to
assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. To the extent any Party
brings an action, suit or proceeding to enforce specifically the performance
of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an action to enforce
specifically any provision that expressly survives termination of this
Agreement), the Outside Date shall automatically be extended to (i) the
twentieth (20th) Business Day following the resolution of such action, suit or
proceeding or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding
over such action, suit or proceeding.

 



 

11.11 _Amendments and Waivers._ The Parties may mutually amend or waive any
provision of this Agreement at any time. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by each of the Parties. No waiver by either Party of any default,
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or
affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such
occurrence.

 



 

11.12 _Severability._ Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction or any arbiter of Disputes declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the body
making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the
power to reduce the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified
after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

 



 

11.13 _As Is Where Is; Release._

 



 

(a) Without limiting Buyers other obligations or acknowledgments, and except
for the representations and warranties contained in _ARTICLE III_ of this
Agreement and the specific covenants of Seller in _ARTICLE VI_ of this
Agreement, Buyer agrees that the Company and the assets (including the
Properties) of the Company at Closing will be accepted

 



      
 

 



 

by Buyer "AS-IS, WHERE-IS" and "WITH ALL FAULTS" (whether latent or patent).
Except as expressly provided in _ARTICLE III_ of this Agreement and the
specific covenants of Seller in _ARTICLE VI_ of this Agreement, Seller
disclaims any express or implied representation or warranty of any kind,
including without limitation, any warranty of habitability, merchantability
and/or fitness for a particular purpose concerning any of the Properties, the
presence or absence of conditions on the Properties that could give rise to a
claim for personal injury, property or natural resource damages, the presence
of Hazardous Substances, on, under, originating or migrating from the
Properties, the income or expense from or of the Properties, the condition of
the UST Systems, fixtures, structures, and all other personal property,
equipment and Dispensers, or the condition of any of the aforementioned. Buyer
acknowledges its responsibility to inspect the Company and its assets
(including any Properties) for defects. Buyers decision to purchase the
Shares is based solely upon Buyers own examination, inspection and analysis
of the Company. As of the Closing, Buyer acknowledges that it has been given
the opportunity to inspect the Company and to obtain satisfactory evidence of
the condition of the Companys assets from sources other than Seller and its
agents and that Buyer has conducted such inspections and reviewed all matters
determined by Buyer as necessary or appropriate in order to determine that the
Company is suitable for Buyers intended use.

 



 

(b) Buyer specifically acknowledges that the Properties have been used for
commercial purposes, including the storage, distribution and marketing of
Fuel, and that the environment, including but not limited to, the soil and
sub-soil of the Properties and the soil, air, land, groundwater and water on,
under, near or adjacent thereto and drains, sewers, pipes, water courses and
water tables at, on, under or in the vicinity of the Properties may have been
contaminated or impacted by Fuel or Hazardous Substances. Except as otherwise
provided in _Section 3.2_ or _ARTICLE VI_ of this Agreement, Buyer expressly
accepts and assumes all risks, whether known or unknown, associated with the
foregoing. Except as expressly provided in _Section 3.2_ of this Agreement,
Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to the compliance or
noncompliance, as the case may be, of any of the Properties with any
Environmental Law, and Buyer acknowledges that Seller makes no such
representation or warranty. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges
that Seller makes (i) no representation or warranty, express or implied, that
any storage tank, including but not limited to any UST System or above ground
storage tank, or any other equipment is free of oil, nonmerchantable petroleum
residue, water or Hazardous Substance; and (ii) no representation or warranty,
express or implied, with reference to the present condition or state of repair
or merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or suitability for
Buyers intended use (or for any use whatsoever) of any storage tank,
including but not limited to, any UST System or above ground storage tank or
equipment relating thereto. Buyer understands and acknowledges that (i) any
storage tank (including any UST System or above ground storage tank) and/or
its related equipment may have or develop certain deficiencies, related but
not limited to, the storage tanks reliability factor; the storage tanks wall
strength; and the USTs striker plate, if any, such that this may result in
the storage tanks buckling, creeping, deflecting, cracking, breaking, or
failing and resulting in storage tank or line leaks; (ii) if any UST was
manufactured during or prior to 1986, such UST may not be compatible with
certain types of fuel, fuel additives or chemicals, including, but not limited
to, ethanol or methyl-tertiary-butyl ether; and (iii) fiberglass USTs
installed prior to 1981 have not been warranted by the manufacturer against
internal corrosion when exposed to ethanol blended fuels and, as a result,

 



       
 

 



 

tank operators should consult with manufacturers as to the suitability of said
tanks prior to introduction of ethanol blended fuels.

 



 

(c) Buyer acknowledges that the pipe, tanks, loading racks, pumps, motors,
valves, fittings, miscellaneous equipment and facilities, and buildings
associated with the Terminal Properties may contain inter alia asbestos in
piping coating, undisplaced petroleum hydrocarbon products in lines, coats of
lead-based paints, polychlorinated biphenyl in transformers or rectifiers,
mercury in electrical switches, and naturally occurring radioactive material
in various potential forms. Buyer also expressly understands that special
procedures may be required for the remediation, removal, transportation and
disposal of these affixed or attached substances from the inside or outside of
the piping, equipment or the Terminal Properties. Notwithstanding any contrary
provision or definition contained herein, in connection with these substances
affixed to the inside or outside of the piping, equipment or the Terminal
Properties, Buyer understands and acknowledges that on and after the Closing
Date, Buyer will expressly assume all liability for or in connection with the
future abandonment and removal of the tanks, equipment and other personal
property included in the Terminal Properties and the assessment, remediation,
removal, transportation and disposal of any such equipment and personal
property and associated activities in accordance with all relevant rules,
regulation and requirements of the applicable Governmental Entity.

 



 

(d) As part of Buyers agreement to purchase the Shares and accept the Company
"AS-IS, WHERE-IS," and "WITH ALL FAULTS," and not as a limitation on such
agreement, Buyer hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any and all
actual or potential claims or rights against the Seller-Related Parties
arising out of the inaccuracy or incompleteness of any materials so furnished,
arising out of any alleged duty of the Seller-Related Parties to acquire, seek
or obtain such materials, arising out of or in connection with the
environmental condition of any Property and any and all actual or potential
claims or rights Buyer might have regarding any form of representation or
warranty, express or implied, of any kind or type, relating to any Property
other than in connection with those representations and warranties expressly
contained in _ARTICLE III_ of this Agreement. Such waiver is absolute,
complete, total and unlimited in any way. Such waiver includes, but is not
limited to, a waiver of express warranties, implied warranties, warranties of
fitness for a particular use, warranties of merchantability, warranties of
habitability, strict liability rights, and claims, liabilities, demands or
causes of action of every kind and type, whether statutory, contractual or
under tort principles, at law or in equity, including, but not limited to,
claims regarding defects which might have been discoverable, claims regarding
defects which were not or are not discoverable, product liability claims,
product liability type claims, all other existing or later created or
conceived strict liability or strict liability type claims and rights, and any
and all claims relating to the environmental condition of any property.

and the transactions contemplated hereby.

Agreement, the following rules of interpretation apply to this Agreement: (i)

Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement; (iii) "date hereof" refers to the date set forth
in the initial caption of this Agreement; (iv) "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such
phrase does not mean simply "if"; (v) definitions contained in this Agreement
are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms; (vi)
references to a contract or agreement mean such contract or agreement as
amended or otherwise modified from time to time; (vii) references to a Person

intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against either
Party.

 



 

11.16 _Waiver of Jury Trial._ To the extent permitted by applicable law, each
Party hereby irrevocably waives all rights to trial by jury in any action,
proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise)
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or the actions of either Party in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement of this Agreement.

 



 

11.17 _Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules._ The Exhibits, Schedules and
Disclosure Schedule identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by
reference and made a part hereof.

 



 

11.18 _Parent Guarantee._

 



 

(a) Parent hereby fully, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Seller
and its successors and assigns the full, complete and timely compliance with,
and performance of, any and all agreements, covenants, obligations and
liabilities of Buyer under or arising out of this Agreement and any other
agreement contemplated to be delivered by Buyer in connection herewith and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (collectively, the "
_Obligations_ "), including, without limitation, all payment obligations of
Buyer arising in connection with this Agreement, in each case, when any of the
same shall become due and payable. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that
the guarantee provided pursuant to this _Section 11.18_ constitutes an
absolute, present, primary, continuing and unconditional guarantee of the
performance, compliance and payment by Buyer of the Obligations when due under
this Agreement and any other agreement entered into by Buyer in connection
herewith and not of collection only and is in no way conditioned or contingent
upon any attempt to enforce such performance, compliance or payment by a
guaranteed party upon any other condition or contingency. Parent hereby waives
any right to require a proceeding first against Buyer.

and in good standing under the laws of Delaware and has all necessary power
and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform the obligations
contemplated hereby. The guarantee provided by Parent pursuant to this
