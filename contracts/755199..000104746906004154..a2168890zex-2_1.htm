 (a) _ Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "; all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock being hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Common Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and any Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $9.75 in cash, without interest (the " _Common Merger Consideration_ ") payable upon surrender in the manner provided in Section 2.02 of the certificate that formerly evidenced such Common Shares subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.01(e).

 Section 2.02 _ Exchange of Certificates._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Paying Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company, with such Paying Agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Sections 2.01(a) and 2.01(b) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") to be deposited with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to Parent on demand. 

  

 (b) _ Exchange Procedures Common Stock._ As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event within 10 days following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Common Shares entitled to receive the Common Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Shares (the " _Common Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Common Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Common Certificates in exchange for the Common Merger Consideration. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Common Certificate for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Common Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefore the amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Common Shares formerly represented by such Common Certificate pursuant to Section 2.01(a), and the Common Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Common Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Common Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Common Certificate representing such Common Shares shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Common Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Common Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as 

  

      

  
  

contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Common Certificate shall be deemed at
all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Common Merger Consideration to which the holder of such
Common Certificate is entitled pursuant to this Article II. No interest shall
be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Common Certificates
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

   

 (c) _ Exchange Procedures Company Preferred Stock._ As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event within 10 days following the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of the Preferred Shares entitled to receive the Preferred Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(b), the Preferred Transmittal Letter. The Preferred Transmittal Letter shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Shares (the " _Preferred Certificates_ " and together with the Common Certificates, the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon: 

    

 (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of (a) a Preferred Certificate, together with (b) the Preferred Transmittal Letter, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and (c) such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, including if elected by such holder in its discretion, such holder\'s specific request to exercise such holder\'s option to have the Company redeem such shares; or 

   

 (ii) surrender to the Paying Agent of (a) a Preferred Certificate for cancellation, together with (b) the Preferred Transmittal Letter, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and (c) such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions. 

    

 Following compliance with the procedure described in Section 2.02(c)(i), the holder of such Preferred Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Preferred Redemption Value such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Preferred Shares formerly represented by such Preferred Certificate pursuant to Section 2.01(b), and the Preferred Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. 

  

 Following compliance with the procedure described in Section 2.02(c)(ii), the holder of such Preferred Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Preferred Conversion Value such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Preferred Shares formerly represented by such Preferred Certificate pursuant to Section 2.01(b), and the Preferred Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. 

  

 Section 2.02(c)(ii) shall apply to all holders of Preferred Shares entitled to receive the Preferred Merger Consideration, except solely with respect to those holders of Preferred Shares who have elected to receive the Preferred Redemption Value under, and satisfied all requirements of, Section 2.02(c)(i) of this Agreement. 

  

 In the event of a transfer of ownership of Preferred Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Preferred Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Preferred Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Preferred Certificate representing such Preferred Shares shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Preferred Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Preferred Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(c), each Preferred Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Preferred Merger Consideration to which the holder of such 

  

      

  
  

Preferred Certificate is entitled pursuant to this Article II. No interest
shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Preferred
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

  

 (d) _ No Further Rights._ From and after the Effective Time, holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. 

  

 (e) _ Exchange Fund for Dissenting Shares._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.02(a) to pay for Shares that become Dissenting Shares shall be delivered to the Parent upon demand following the filing of a petition for appraisal of the Shares with the Delaware Court of Chancery; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for such Shares held by any stockholder who shall have failed to perfect or who otherwise shall have withdrawn or lost such stockholder\'s rights to appraisal of such Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_"). 

  

 (f) _ Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Parent and Surviving Corporation for, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that portion of the Exchange Fund attributable to the difference between the Preferred Conversion Value over the Preferred Redemption Value due to the election of the Redemption Option under Section 2.02(c)(i) (the " _Preferred Excess Amount_ ") shall be retained by the Parent and the holders of the Shares shall not have right or claim to such Preferred Excess Amount. 

  

 (g) _ No Liability._ None of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Co or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any such Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or cash properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (h) _ Withholding Rights._ Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and Merger Co shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under applicable Law and pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that amounts are so properly withheld by the Paying Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Merger Co, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Merger Co, as the case may be. 

  

 (i) _ Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a). 

  

  

 Section 2.03 _ Stock Transfer Books._ At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights 

        

with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement
or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the
Paying Agent or Merger Co for any reason shall be cancelled against delivery
of the Merger Consideration to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant

 (a) The Surviving Corporation shall honor the terms of all employment agreements and pay or provide the benefits required thereunder in accordance with their terms, recognizing that the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will constitute a "change in control" for purposes of any of the employment agreements and Plans that include a definition of "change in control." 

  

 (b) With respect to employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (each, an " _Employee_ "), for the period from the Effective Time to the first anniversary of the Effective Time, or such earlier date on which any Employee\'s employment is terminated (except with respect to any benefits payable upon or after termination of employment), the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide salary, discretionary bonus and employee benefits (other than (i) equity-based compensation, (ii) those benefits listed in Section 6.06 of the Company Disclosure Schedule as terminating at the Effective Time, and (iii) any employee welfare or benefit Plan that is not listed in Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 (e) With respect to the welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Parent or the Surviving Corporation (" _Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans_ ") in which 

        
  

an Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law (i) waive, or use
reasonable best efforts to cause its insurance carrier to waive, all
limitations as to preexisting and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to each active
Employee under any Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan to the same extent waived
under a comparable Plan and (ii) make reasonable best efforts to cause any
eligible expenses incurred by any Employee and his or her covered dependents
to be taken into account under the Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such Employee and his or her dependents as
if such amounts had been paid in accordance with the Purchaser Welfare Benefit
Plans.

  

 (f) Nothing in this Section 6.06, expressed or implied, shall be construed to prevent Parent or any subsidiary of Parent (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any benefit plan that Parent or any subsidiary of Parent (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) may establish or maintain; provided that appropriate provision is made to comply with the provisions of this Section 6.06.

Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, (i) the Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Company contained herein or the failure of any representation or warranty of the Company contained herein to remain accurate (other than any such representation or warranty that expressly spoke only as of the date of this Agreement or as a result of any transaction permitted by Section 5.01 or in accordance with Article VI of this Agreement), (ii) Parent will promptly notify the Company in writing of any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of Parent or Merger Co contained herein or the failure of any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Co contained herein to remain accurate (other than any such representation or warranty that expressly spoke only as of the date of this Agreement or as a result of any transaction in accordance with Article VI of this Agreement), and (iii) the Company will notify Parent in writing and Parent will notify the Company in writing of any communication received (A) from any Person alleging a consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) from any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

obtaining of the financing contemplated by any Commitment Letter. Parent shall
not amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, any Commitment Letter in any
manner that would impair, delay or prevent the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company.

 (B) use their reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry in a judicial or administrative proceeding brought under any antitrust Law by any Government Antitrust Authority of any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order that would make consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would prevent or delay such consummation; 

  

 (C) take promptly, in the event that such an injunction or order has been issued in such a proceeding, any and all steps, including, without limitation, the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the other steps contemplated by clause (A) above, necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement; and 

  

 (D) take promptly all other actions and do all other things necessary and proper to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Government Antitrust Authority or any other party to the consummation of the Merger by the Parent and Merger Co in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

    

 (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 6.09(b), Parent, Merger Co and the Company shall not be required (A) to agree to or make any divestiture of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property of Parent, Merger Co or the Company, or any of their respective subsidiaries or Affiliates if, as a result of such request, the aggregate fair market value of the shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property required to be divested or held separate by Parent, Merger Co and their subsidiaries, on the one hand, or by the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, would exceed $5,000,000; or (B) take any of the actions described in subsections (A) through (D) of Section 6.09(b)(ii), if to do so would, in the reasonable, good faith judgment of the management committee of the general partner of SemGroup LP, have a material adverse effect upon the business plans of SemGroup LP for the conduct of the business after the Closing of (x) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (y) TransMontaigne Partners and the MLP Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and/or 

  

      

  

(z) SemGroup LP and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. If after complying

subsidiaries would be required to agree to or take any action referred to in,
or having the effect referred to in, clauses (A) or (B) of this Section
6.09(b)(iii), Parent shall have the option of terminating this Agreement upon
a final determination by the Government Antitrust Authority that taking or
agreeing to take such action is required in order to consummate the Merger.

  

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 6.09, neither Parent nor Merger Co, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall be required to take any action that, in the opinion of Parent after consultation with outside counsel, is reasonably likely to cause SemGroup LP or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates, other than the Company (and its Subsidiaries) and TransMontaigne Partners (and its subsidiaries) after the Effective Time, to be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or otherwise be required to file periodic reports under the Exchange Act.

It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in Court of Chancery or other courts of the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity.

Each party hereto hereby agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set forth in Section 9.02 shall be effective service of process for any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 9.09 _ Waiver of Jury Trial._ Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Merger.
