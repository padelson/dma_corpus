STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT 

   

 THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of August 12, 2006, by and among A.M. Castle and Co., a Maryland corporation (the " _Buyer_ ") and Transtar Holdings #2, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Seller_ "). The Buyer and the Seller may be referred to herein as a " _Party_ " and collectively, as the " _Parties_." Certain capitalized terms used herein, and not otherwise defined, are defined in Article X. 

  

 WHEREAS, the Seller owns beneficially and of record 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock (the " _Shares_ ") of Transtar Intermediate Holdings #2, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, on the terms of this Agreement, the Buyer desires to acquire from the Seller all of the Shares and the Seller desires to sell to the Buyer all of the Shares. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations and warranties and mutual covenants contained herein and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

SALE AND PURCHASE OF SHARES  

  

 1.01. _Transfer of Shares_. On the terms of this Agreement, at the Closing referred to in Section 1.05, the Seller shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to the Buyer (or its designated Affiliate if assigned in accordance with Section 11.05), and the Buyer (or its designated Affiliate if assigned in accordance with Section 11.05) shall purchase, acquire and accept from the Seller, all right, title and interest in and to all of the Shares, free and clear of all Liens, which Shares will comprise all outstanding ownership interests in the Company as of the Closing. 

  

 1.02. _Purchase Price_. 

  

 (a) The purchase price for the Shares shall be equal to the sum of (i) $180,000,000  _plus_ (ii) the amount, if any, by which the Working Capital as of the end of the business day immediately prior to the Closing exceeds the Maximum Working Capital, less (iii) the amount, if any, by which the Minimum Working Capital exceeds the Working Capital as of the end of the business day immediately prior to the Closing, _less_ (iv) an amount equal to the outstanding Net Indebtedness as of the Closing, _less_ (i) the aggregate amount of Transaction Expenses payable in cash by the Company or the Subsidiaries on or after the Closing (collectively for clauses (i) through (v), the " _Purchase Price_ "), subject to the post-closing adjustment pursuant to Sections 1.03 and 1.04 (the " _Purchase Price Adjustment_ "). An estimate of the Purchase Price (along with the components thereof) will be calculated by the Seller in good faith and such calculation will be delivered to the Buyer at least one (1) day prior to the Closing (as estimated, the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ "). At the Closing, the Buyer shall pay to the Seller an amount equal to the Estimated Purchase Price (less the Escrow Amount) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by the Seller. 

    ##### 

  

 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no item shall be counted more
than one time when calculating the Purchase Price and the components
thereof. 

   

 (b) Simultaneously with the Closing, the Buyer shall repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf of the Company and the Subsidiaries, the amounts necessary to satisfy outstanding Indebtedness (except for capital leases or other Indebtedness not being paid off at Closing as determined by Buyer with written notice to Seller ten days prior to Closing) as evidenced by appropriate payoff letters by wire transfer of immediately available funds as directed by the holders of Indebtedness, and the Seller shall make arrangements for lenders under the Indebtedness to deliver UCC-3 termination statements or similar documents evidencing the termination of all liens, security interests, mortgages and other encumbrances held by such lenders. 

   

 (c) Simultaneously with the Closing, the Buyer shall deposit the Escrow Amount, which will be available to satisfy any amounts owed to Buyer pursuant to Article VIII of this Agreement, in an escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") established pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, by and among Wells Fargo, N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), the Buyer and the Seller. 

   

 1.03. _Adjustment of Purchase Price_. 

  

 (a) Within 45 days following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Subsidiaries (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and a calculation of the Purchase Price and the Working Capital (collectively, with the Closing Balance Sheet, the " _Purchase Price Statement_ ") as of the end of the business day immediately preceding the Closing Date. The Purchase Price Statement shall be prepared and the Working Capital shall be determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, except for the exceptions described on the _GAAP Exceptions Schedule_ and shall not include any changes in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments and with respect to inventory, will include the book to physical difference calculated as set forth on the _Inventory Procedures Schedule_. The Parties agree that the purpose of preparing the Purchase Price Statement and determining the Working Capital contemplated by this Section 1.03 is to measure changes in the Working Capital, and hereby agree that there shall not be introduced any different accounting methods, principles, classifications or estimation methodologies from such accounting methods, principles, classifications or estimation methodologies used in calculating the Minimum Working Capital and Maximum Working Capital as set forth on the _Net Working Capital Schedule_ 1, for the purpose of preparing the Purchase Price Statement or determining the Working Capital. 

   

 (b) During the 30-day period immediately following the Sellers receipt of the Purchase Price Statement, the Seller shall be permitted to review the Buyers working papers and the underlying accounting records related to the preparation of the Purchase Price Statement and determination of the Purchase Price. The Buyer shall cooperate and provide prompt access to the Companys books and records and relevant personnel (including third party consultants and

accountants), in each case as reasonably requested by the Seller in connection
with the Sellers review of the Purchase Price Statement. The Purchase Price
Statement and Purchase Price shall become final and binding upon the Parties
30 days after the Sellers receipt of the Purchase Price Statement, unless
the Seller shall give written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice
of Disagreement_ ") to the Buyer prior to such date. Any Notice of
Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and dollar amount
of any disagreement so asserted. If a timely Notice of Disagreement is
received by the Buyer, then the Purchase Price Statement (as revised
in accordance with clause (x) or (y) below) shall become final and binding
upon the parties on the earliest of (x) the date the Parties resolve in
writing any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in
the Notice of Disagreement or (y) the date all matters in dispute are finally
resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm (defined below). During the 30 days
following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, the parties shall seek in
good faith to resolve in writing any differences which they have with respect
to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. Following delivery of
a Notice of Disagreement the Buyer and its agents and representatives shall
be permitted to review the Sellers and its agents and
representatives working papers relating to the Notice of Disagreement. 

   

 (c) At the end of the 30-day period referred to above, either Buyer or Seller may retain Ernst and Young LLP to resolve all remaining disputed items, or if Ernst and Young LLP is unable or unwilling to act as the accounting firm to resolve the remaining disputed items, the Buyer and the Seller shall mutually select a nationally recognized accounting firm (other than the Buyers and the Companys accountants prior to the Closing) (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The Parties shall submit to the Accounting Firm for review and resolution of all matters (but only such matters) that remain in dispute. The Parties shall instruct the Accounting Firm to select one of its partners experienced in purchase price adjustment disputes to make a final determination of the Purchase Price calculated with reference to the amounts that are in dispute. The Parties will cooperate with the Accounting Firm during the term of its engagement. The Parties shall also instruct the Accounting Firm to make its determination based solely on written submissions by the Buyer and the Seller which are in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e. not on the basis of an independent review). The Accounting Firm may, at its discretion, request additional information and each Party shall have the right to respond to inquiries of the Accounting Firm, by way of additional documents, materials or other information. The Purchase Price Statement and the determination of the Purchase Price shall become final and binding on the Parties on the date the Accounting Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to the Parties (which final resolution shall be requested by the Parties to be delivered not more than 45 days following submission of such disputed matters), absent manifest clerical errors or fraud. The final resolution will be a reasoned resolution setting forth the Accounting Firms reasoning in reaching its determination. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party. As an example and for illustrative purposes only, if the Buyer contends that there should be a Purchase Price decrease of $1,000,000, the Seller contends that there should be no Purchase Price increase and the Accounting Firm determines that there should be a Purchase Price decrease of $300,000, then the Buyer shall pay 70% of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and the Seller shall pay 30% of such fees and expenses. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) The Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.03 is referred to as the " _Final Purchase Price_." 

   

 1.04. _The Post-Closing Adjustment Payments_. If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, then the Buyer shall, within five (5) days after the date the Final Purchase Price is determined under and in accordance with Section 1.03 above, pay to the Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by the Seller above, the amount of such difference. If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then the Seller shall, within five (5) days after the date the Final Purchase Price is determined under and in accordance with Section 1.03 above, pay to the Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by the Buyer above, the amount of such difference. 

  

 1.05. _The Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Greenberg Traurig, LLP located at 77 W. Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60601 at 10:00 a.m., local time, on (i) September 5, 2006 or (ii) at Buyers election and following two days prior written notice to Seller, such earlier date that is on or after the second business day following satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article II_ (other than those to be satisfied at the Closing), or (iii) if any of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Article II (other than those to be satisfied at the Closing) have not been satisfied or waived by the Party entitled to the benefit thereof, then on or prior to the second business day following satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article II_ (other than those to be satisfied at the Closing) or (iv) on such other date as is mutually agreeable to Buyer and the Seller. The date and time of the Closing are referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." All transactions contemplated herein to occur at the Closing or on the Closing Date shall be deemed to have occurred simultaneously and to be effective as of the opening of business on the Closing Date. 

  

 1.06. _Manner of Delivery of Shares_. At the Closing, the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer certificates evidencing the Shares duly endorsed in blank, or accompanied by valid stock powers duly executed in blank, in proper form for transfer. 

  

ARTICLE II

 (b) No claim for indemnification hereunder for breach of any such representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and other provisions may be made after the expiration of the survival period set forth in the immediately preceding sentence; provided that 

    ##### 

  

    

any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision in
respect of which indemnity may be sought under Section 8.02(a) or under
Section 8.03, and the indemnity with respect thereto, shall survive (with
respect to any claim that has been made) the time at which it would otherwise
terminate pursuant to this Section 8.01 if written notice specifically
describing the breach thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity and a
reasonable estimate of the Loss, shall have been given to the Person against
whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such time. 

   

 8.02. _Indemnification by the Seller for the Benefit of the Buyer_. 

  

 (a) Provided that timely notice has been made within the prescribed survival period set forth in Section 8.01 above with respect thereto, the Seller shall indemnify the Buyer and save and hold it harmless against all loss, liability, damage, cost, obligations, interest, penalty, attorneys fees and disbursements and expense (collectively, " _Losses_ "), which the Buyer may suffer or sustain as a result of or arising out of: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made under Article IV and/or Article V as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing, disregarding the materiality qualifiers in the fifth sentence of Section 5.02 and the second sentence of Section 5.14, (ii) any breach of any covenant, agreement or other provision by the Seller or (iii) all Losses related to item number 5 on Schedule 5.11 (Litigation) of the Disclosure Schedules (the " _Sophie Bigot Matter_ "); _provided_ that the Seller shall have no liability under this Section 8.02(a) (except for a breach of the Fundamental Representations or Losses related to the Sophie Bigot Matter), unless and until the aggregate of all Losses relating thereto for which the Seller would, but for this proviso, be liable exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $500,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent such Losses exceed the Deductible; and _provided_ _further_ that the Seller aggregate liability under this Section 8.02(a) (except for a breach of the Fundamental Representations) shall in no event exceed $18,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Losses shall not include any consequential, special, indirect, exemplary or punitive damages, including diminution of value, loss measured by any multiple or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to a breach or alleged breach of this Agreement; _provided_ that these exclusions from Losses shall not apply to an award of damages to a third party payable by the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to events for which Seller is required to indemnify Buyer hereunder;  _provided_ _further_ however, if subject to these exclusions the loss of a customer contract is determined to be an indemnifiable event these exclusions shall not be deemed to preclude the inclusion of incremental carrying costs or other losses on inventory held for such contract from the calculation of Losses and (ii) the amount of indemnity payable pursuant to this Section 8.02 with respect to any Losses shall be reduced (x) by any reserves or accruals on the books of the Company and/or the Subsidiaries as of the Closing relating to the subject matter of the applicable Losses, (y) to the extent a reserve or accrual for such Loss amount has already been taken into account in making any Purchase Price Adjustment contemplated in Article I and (z) as set forth in Section 8.04. 

   

 (b) The indemnification rights of Buyer under this Agreement, together with the Escrow Agreement, the post-closing adjustment rights under Section 1.04, and the tax payment obligations of the Seller to the Buyer under Section 9.03, constitute the Buyers sole and exclusive remedies following the Closing for any and all Losses or other claims relating to or arising from this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, other than with respect to fraud. The Buyer may not avoid the limitations on liability of the Seller set forth in this 

    ##### 

  

    

Section 8.02 by seeking damages for breach of contract, tort or pursuant to
any other theory of liability. Without limiting the generality of the
preceding sentences of this Section 8.02(b), the Buyer hereby waives any and
all statutory rights of contribution or indemnification that it
might otherwise be entitled to under any federal, state, local or foreign
law, regulation or ordinance or any similar rules of law embodied in the
common law. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Seller will not be liable to the Buyer for any Loss related to a breach by Seller of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements if Buyer has breached its representation in Section 6.09 with respect to the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement which gave rise to such Loss. 

   

 8.03. _Indemnification by the Buyer for the Benefit of the Seller_. The Buyer shall indemnify the Seller and hold it harmless against any Losses which the Seller may suffer or sustain, as a result of: (a) any breach of any representation or warranty made under Article VI and (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or other provision by the Buyer. 

  

 8.04. _Determination of Loss Amount_. The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under Section 8.02, Section 8.03 or Section 8.05 shall be calculated net of (i) any Indemnity Tax Benefit inuring to the Indemnitee on account of such Loss within the four year period after the Closing Date and (ii) any insurance proceeds received or receivable by the Indemnitee on account of such Loss. Subject to the time limitation set forth in the preceding sentence, if the Indemnitee receives a Indemnity Tax Benefit after an indemnification payment is made to it, the Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Person or Persons that made such indemnification payment the amount of such Indemnity Tax Benefit at such time or times as and to the extent that such Indemnity Tax Benefit is realized by the Indemnitee. For purposes hereof, " _Indemnity Tax Benefit_ " shall mean any refund of Taxes paid or payable or reduction in the amount of Taxes which otherwise would have been paid, in each case computed at the highest marginal tax rates applicable to the recipient of such benefit. The Indemnitee shall use reasonable best efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as it would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any Indemnitee with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly to the Person or Persons that provided such indemnity payments to such Indemnitee. 

  

 8.05. _Environmental_. The Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify the Buyer pursuant to Section 8.02 with respect to any environmental matter unless the matter for which indemnification is sought is required by an applicable Environmental Requirement. Unless the Buyer first obtains the Sellers prior written consent, the Buyer shall not be entitled to indemnification by the Seller in the event that the Buyer takes any action outside the ordinary course of business of the Company or its Subsidiaries which results in the imposition by any governmental authority or court of an obligation which would otherwise be subject to indemnification, unless such action either is required by an applicable Environmental Requirement or is necessary in order to respond to a specific request for information posed to the Buyer during the course of a duly authorized inquiry by a governmental authority; _provided_ that 

   ##### 

  

 

for purposes of clarification, Phase II environmental reports are deemed to be
outside the ordinary course of business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
unless specifically required by applicable Environmental Requirement for
actions taken by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of
business. The Seller shall have no obligations to indemnify the Buyer to
the extent the environmental condition for which indemnification is sought is
caused, aggravated or exacerbated by the acts or omissions of the Buyer (or
any Person acting on behalf of the Buyer). 

   

 8.06. _Manner of Payment_. Any indemnification of the Buyer pursuant to Section 8.02 shall be first in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and, to the extent applicable, after the Escrow Account has terminated, shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by each applicable Indemnitee (as defined below) within 15 days after the final determination thereof. Any indemnification of the Seller pursuant to Section 8.03 shall be effected by Buyers wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by each applicable Indemnitee within 15 days after the final determination thereof. Each indemnification payment made pursuant to this Article VIII shall, with respect to the Seller and the Buyer, be deemed to be an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

  

 8.07. _Defense of Third Party Claims_. Any Person making a claim for indemnification under Section 8.02 or Section 8.03 (an " _Indemnitee_ ") shall notify the indemnifying party (an " _Indemnitor_ ") of the claim in writing promptly after receiving written notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim against it (if by a third party), describing with specificity the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof; _provided_ that the failure to so notify an Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that (and only to the extent that) such failure shall have caused the damages for which the Indemnitor is obligated to be greater than such damages would have been had the Indemnitee given the Indemnitor prompt notice hereunder.

If the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim then the Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such claim; _provided_ that the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee or if such settlement does not expressly release the Indemnitee from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim, without prejudice, except for payments that would be required to be paid by the Buyer representing the Deductible. The Seller shall act on behalf of all Indemnitors in the case of all third party claims with respect to which the Buyer is seeking indemnification under Section 8.02.

 (b) In any arbitration pursuant to this Agreement, (i) discovery shall be allowed and governed by the Delaware Code of Civil Procedure, (ii) each of the Parties shall promptly submit to the Arbitrator its proposed resolution of the Dispute, and (iii) the award or decision shall be rendered by a single arbitrator, who is a licensed attorney in the State of Delaware and experienced in handling disputes of the type presented in the Dispute and who shall be appointed by mutual agreement of the Buyer and the Seller; _provided_ _that_ if the Dispute relates primarily to accounting issues the arbitrator should be a licensed certified public accountant in the State of Delaware experienced in handling disputes of the type represented in the Dispute and who shall be appointed by mutual agreement of the Buyer and the Seller.

The Arbitrator chosen is referred to as the " _Arbitrator_."

   ##### 

  

  

 9.03. _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) _Responsibility For Filing Tax Returns_. The Buyer shall include the Company and the Subsidiaries in its consolidated Tax group effective as of the day following the Closing Date, thereby causing the Tax year of the Company and the Subsidiary for federal and to the extent applicable, state and local income Tax purposes to end on the Closing Date. The Buyer will timely prepare and file with the appropriate governmental Persons all Tax Returns that are due after the Closing Date and that have not been filed prior to the Closing Date. Any such Tax Return for the period ending on the Closing Date (" _Stub Period Return_ ") or a period ending prior to the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Period Return_ ") shall be furnished to the Seller for its review, comment and approval at least 15 days prior to the due date (or extended due date) for filing such Tax Returns. If the Buyer and Seller cannot resolve any dispute with respect to such Tax Returns, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.03(c). Seller will remit to the Buyer not less than 7 days prior to the due date (or extended due date) of any Stub Period Returns and Pre-Closing Period Returns (and indemnify and hold the Buyer harmless) all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns, except to the extent such Taxes have been paid or deposited prior to the Closing Date or except to the extent that such Taxes are included in the calculation of Working Capital. Seller shall cooperate fully in connection with the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns. To the extent reasonably practicable, Buyer shall cause the Stub Period Returns to be filed by the Company and Subsidiaries within 60 days following the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) _Tax Benefit  Stub Period Return_. The Transaction Expenses will be claimed as deductions by the Company and its Subsidiaries on the Stub Period Returns to the extent that there is "substantial authority" for claiming such deductions. Buyer will cause the Company and any Subsidiary to promptly apply for any overpayment of estimated taxes shown on a Stub Period Return (by filing Form 4466 and any corresponding state tax form) and remit such refund to Seller within 5 days after receipt of same. 

   

 (c) _Tax Benefit  Stub Period NOL_. Buyer will cause the Company and any Subsidiary to remit to the Seller any Tax Benefit realized in a taxable year or period (other than the taxable period covered by a Stub Period Return) as follows. To the extent a Stub Period Return reflects a net operating loss (" _Stub Period NOL_ "), Buyer will cause the Company and any Subsidiary to carry back such Stub Period NOL (or portions thereof) to prior taxable years or periods of the Company and/or the Subsidiaries (by filing, if appropriate, Form 1139 and any corresponding state Tax form) and will remit to Seller the portion of such refund allocable to the Tax Benefit within 10 days after receipt of such refund. To the extent the Stub Period NOL (or portion thereof) is not carried back to taxable years or periods of the Company and/or Subsidiaries ending prior to the Closing Date, and the Company or any Subsidiary realizes a Tax Benefit due to the carry forward of such Stub Period NOL (or portion thereof) to a taxable year or period of the Company and/or Subsidiaries ending after the Closing Date, the Buyer will remit to Seller the amount of such Tax Benefit within 10 days after filing the Tax Return on which the Stub Period NOL is applied to reduce Taxes for such taxable year or period. For the sake of clarity, the Seller shall not receive any Tax Benefit from the carry forward of a Stub Period NOL to the extent that the amount of the Stub Period NOL exceeds the amount of the aggregate deduction for Transaction Expenses. The Buyer, the Company and Subsidiaries will as promptly 

    ##### 

  

    

as practicable take appropriate steps to actually realize at the earliest
possible time any Tax Benefit with respect to any Stub Period NOL. 

   

 (d) _Transfer Taxes_. The Buyer will pay, and will indemnify and hold the Seller harmless against, any Tax imposed on the Company and/or the Subsidiaries or the Seller (other than income Taxes) as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), and any penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer Taxes. The Seller agrees to cooperate with the Buyer in the filing of any returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including promptly supplying any information in its possession reasonably requested by the Buyer that is reasonably necessary to complete such returns. If the Buyer fails to file any returns with respect to Transfer Taxes, the Seller, at the Buyers expense, may file such returns. 

   

 (e) _Tax Indemnification_. 

    

 (i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Seller will defend, indemnify and hold the Buyer harmless from and against all Losses arising out of or related to (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof), of the Company or any Subsidiary for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and for the portion through the Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), and (ii) any and all Taxes of any other Person imposed on the Company or a Subsidiary as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing, in each case except to the extent that such Taxes have been paid or deposited prior to the Closing Date or except to the extent that such Taxes are included in the calculation of Working Capital. 

   

 (ii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Buyer will cause the Company to defend, indemnify and hold the Seller harmless from and against all Losses arising out of or related to all Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary for all taxable periods ending after the Closing Date (except to the extent such taxable period began before the Closing Date, in which case such indemnity will cover only that portion of any such Taxes that are not allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period as determined under Section 9.03(e)(iii)). 

   

 (iii) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary for the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be computed as follows: any Tax based directly or indirectly on income or receipts and any credits, losses or deductions available with respect to any Tax, shall be allocated by assuming that the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date, and any other Tax shall be allocated based on a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the taxable period. Any credit or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be prorated based upon the method employed in this paragraph, taking into account the type of Tax to which the refund relates. All determinations necessary to effect the foregoing 

   ##### 

  

    

allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the
Company and the Subsidiaries. 

   

 (iv) If a party is responsible for the payment of Taxes pursuant to this Section 9.03 (the " _Tax Indemnifying Party_ ") and the other party to this Agreement (the " _Tax Indemnified Party_ ") receives notice of any deficiency, proposed adjustment, assessment, audit, examination, suit, dispute or other claim (a " _Tax Claim_ ") with respect to such Taxes, the Tax Indemnified Party will promptly notify the Tax Indemnifying Party in writing of such Tax Claim, but the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability they may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual prejudice thereby. 

   

 (v) With respect to any Tax Claim, the Tax Indemnifying Party will assume and control all proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim and, without limiting the foregoing, may pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any applicable governmental Persons with respect thereto, and may, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party will consult with the Tax Indemnified Party in the negotiation and settlement of any Tax Claim and the Tax Indemnifying Party will not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, settle or compromise any Tax Claim in any manner if such settlement or compromise would have the effect of increasing the Taxes of the Tax Indemnified Party (" _Indemnified Party Tax Increase_ "); _provided_ , however, that the consent of the Indemnified Party will not be required if the Tax Indemnifying Party indemnifies the Indemnified Party for all Losses attributable to such Indemnified Party Tax Increase; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that, to the extent that a Tax Claim relates to the Straddle Period, the Seller and the Buyer will jointly control all proceedings taken in connection with any such Tax Claim. 

   

 (vi) The Tax Indemnified Party will cooperate with the Tax Indemnifying Party in contesting any Tax Claim, which cooperation will include the retention and (upon the Tax Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the Tax Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim. 

   

 (vii) Neither party will settle or compromise a Tax Claim relating solely to Taxes of the Company or a Subsidiary for a Straddle Period without the other partys written consent which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

   

 (viii) The Seller and the Buyer agree that any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Section 9.03 or as an indemnity under Article VIII will be treated by the parties on their Tax Returns as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless a final determination by a relevant taxing authority causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) Neither the Buyer nor any Affiliate of the Buyer, shall (i) amend, refile or otherwise modify, or cause or permit the Company or any Subsidiary to amend, refile or otherwise modify, any Tax election or Tax Return with respect to any taxable period (or portion of any taxable period), ending on or before the date of the Closing without the prior written consent of the Seller, which will not be unreasonably withheld, unless otherwise required by law or regulation. 

   

 9.04. _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any Party hereto and at such Partys expense, any other Party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as the requesting Party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 9.05. _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, the Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, provide the Seller and its authorized representatives with reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the books and records and any relevant personnel of the Company and the Subsidiaries with respect to periods prior to the Closing Date in connection with any reasonable matter whether or not relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the Seller, the Buyer shall not permit the Company or the Subsidiaries, for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date, to destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any books and records of the Company or the Subsidiaries, or any portions thereof, relating to periods prior to the Closing Date without first giving reasonable prior written notice to the Seller and offering to surrender to the Seller such books and records or such portions thereof. 

  

 9.06. _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the Buyer shall not, and shall not permit the Company or any of the Subsidiaries to amend, repeal or modify any provision in the Companys or any of the Subsidiaries certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any officers and directors (unless required by law) with respect to the periods prior to the Closing; it being the intent of the Parties that such officers and directors of the Company and the Subsidiaries shall (i) be third party beneficiaries of this Agreement and (ii) continue to be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification to the fullest extent of the law. 

   

 (b) For a coverage period of six (6) years after the Closing, the Seller shall or shall cause the Company to purchase, on or prior to the Closing, director and officer liability insurance providing coverage for the individuals who were officers and directors of the Company and/or the Subsidiaries immediately prior to Closing comparable to the policy or policies maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing for the benefit of such individuals. 

   

 9.07. _Employee Matters_. 

  

 Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Seller with respect to, any notices, payments, benefits, fines,

caused in part by the termination of employees of the Company or the
Subsidiaries by the Buyer on or after Closing. 

   

 9.08. _Letters of Credit_. 

  

 Concurrently with the Closing, Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to replace all of the letters of credit set forth on Section 9.08 of the Disclosure Schedules to the extent such letters of credit are terminated at or prior to the Closing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that Buyers failure to replace any such letter of credit shall not result in, or give rise to, any indemnifiable Loss for the Buyer. 

  

 9.09. _Non-solicitation_. 

  

 (a) For a period of two (2) years after the Closing, unless otherwise agreed to by Buyer, the Seller will not, and will cause any Affiliate of the Seller, not to, solicit for employment or employ, directly or indirectly, any Executive of the Company or any Subsidiary, as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) For a period of two (2) years after the Closing, unless otherwise agreed to by Buyer, the Seller will not, and will cause any Affiliate of the Seller, not to, solicit for employment, directly or indirectly, any employee (other than an Executive) of the Company or any Subsidiary, as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date.

This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any Party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each other Party hereto or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all other Parties. No Party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine as a defense to the formation of a contract and each such Party forever waives any such defense.
