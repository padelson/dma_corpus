capitalized terms used herein, and not otherwise defined, are defined in Article&nbsp;X.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Seller owns beneficially and of record 100% of the issued and outstanding shares
of capital stock (the &#147;<U>Shares</U>&#148;) of Transtar Intermediate Holdings #2, Inc., a Delaware

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, on the terms of this Agreement, the Buyer desires to acquire from the Seller all of

contained herein and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

of all Liens, which Shares will comprise all outstanding ownership interests in the Company as of
the Closing.

day immediately prior to the Closing exceeds the Maximum Working Capital, less (iii)&nbsp;the amount, if
any, by which the Minimum Working Capital exceeds the Working Capital as of the end of the business
day immediately prior to the Closing, <U>less</U> (iv)&nbsp;an amount equal to the outstanding Net
Indebtedness as of the Closing, <U>less</U> (i)&nbsp;the aggregate amount of Transaction Expenses

Purchase Price (along with the components thereof) will be calculated by the Seller in good faith
and such calculation will be delivered to the Buyer at least one (1)&nbsp;day prior to the Closing (as
estimated, the &#147;<U>Estimated Purchase Price</U>&#148;). At the Closing, the Buyer shall pay to the

any differences which they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of

shall mutually select a nationally recognized accounting firm (other than the Buyer&#146;s and the
Company&#146;s accountants prior to the Closing) (the &#147;<U>Accounting Firm</U>&#148;). The Parties shall
submit to the Accounting Firm for review and resolution of all matters (but only such matters) that
remain in dispute. The Parties shall instruct the Accounting Firm to select one of its partners
experienced in purchase price adjustment disputes to make a final determination of the Purchase
Price calculated with reference to the amounts that are in dispute. The Parties will cooperate with
the Accounting Firm during the term of its engagement. The Parties shall also instruct the
Accounting Firm to make its determination based solely on written submissions by the Buyer and the
Seller which are in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e.
not on the basis of an independent review). The Accounting Firm may, at its discretion, request
additional information and each Party shall have the right to respond to inquiries of the
Accounting Firm, by way of additional documents, materials or other information. The Purchase Price
Statement and the determination of the Purchase Price shall become final and binding on the Parties
on the date the Accounting Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to the Parties (which
final resolution shall be requested by the Parties to be delivered not more than 45&nbsp;days following
submission of such disputed matters), absent manifest clerical errors or fraud. The final
resolution will be a reasoned resolution setting forth the Accounting Firm&#146;s reasoning in reaching
its determination. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm
shall be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, based
upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to
the amount actually contested by such Party. As an example and for illustrative purposes only, if
the Buyer contends that there should be a Purchase Price decrease of $1,000,000, the Seller
contends that there should be no Purchase Price increase and the Accounting Firm determines that
there should be a Purchase Price decrease of $300,000, then the Buyer shall pay 70% of the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm and the Seller shall pay 30% of such fees and expenses.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>Responsibility For Filing Tax Returns</U>. The Buyer shall include the Company and
the Subsidiaries in its consolidated Tax group effective as of the day following the Closing Date,
thereby causing the Tax year of the Company and the Subsidiary for federal and to the extent
applicable, state and local income Tax purposes to end on the Closing Date. The Buyer will timely
prepare and file with the appropriate governmental Persons all Tax Returns that are due after the
Closing Date and that have not been filed prior to the Closing Date. Any such Tax Return for the
period ending on the Closing Date (&#147;<U>Stub Period Return</U>&#148;) or a period ending prior to the
Closing Date (&#147;<U>Pre-Closing Period Return</U>&#148;) shall be
furnished to the Seller for its review, comment and approval at least 15&nbsp;days prior to the due date (or extended due date) for filing such
Tax Returns. If the Buyer and Seller cannot resolve any dispute with respect to such Tax Returns,
the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section&nbsp;1.03(c). Seller will
remit to the Buyer not less than 7&nbsp;days prior to the due date (or extended due date) of any Stub
Period Returns and Pre-Closing Period Returns (and indemnify and hold the Buyer harmless) all Taxes
due with respect to such Tax Returns, except to the extent such Taxes have been paid or deposited
prior to the Closing Date or except to the extent that such Taxes are included in the calculation
of Working Capital. Seller shall cooperate fully in connection with the preparation and filing of
such Tax Returns. To the extent reasonably practicable, Buyer shall cause the Stub Period Returns
to be filed by the Company and Subsidiaries within 60&nbsp;days following the Closing Date.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Tax Benefit &#151; Stub Period Return</U>. The Transaction Expenses will be claimed as
deductions by the Company and its Subsidiaries on the Stub Period Returns to the extent that there
is &#147;substantial authority&#148; for claiming such deductions. Buyer will cause the Company and any
Subsidiary to promptly apply for any overpayment of estimated taxes shown on a Stub Period Return
(by filing Form&nbsp;4466 and any corresponding state tax form) and remit such refund to Seller within 5
days after receipt of same.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>Tax Benefit &#151; Stub Period NOL</U>. Buyer will cause the Company and any Subsidiary to
remit to the Seller any Tax Benefit realized in a taxable year or period (other than the taxable
period covered by a Stub Period Return) as follows. To the extent a Stub Period Return reflects a
net operating loss (&#147;<U>Stub Period NOL</U>&#148;), Buyer will cause the Company and any Subsidiary to
carry back such Stub Period NOL (or portions thereof) to prior taxable years or periods of the
Company and/or the Subsidiaries (by filing, if appropriate, Form&nbsp;1139 and any corresponding state
Tax form) and will remit to Seller the portion of such refund allocable to the Tax Benefit within
10&nbsp;days after receipt of such refund. To the extent the Stub Period NOL (or portion thereof) is
not carried back to taxable years or periods of the Company and/or Subsidiaries ending prior to the
Closing Date, and the Company or any Subsidiary realizes a Tax Benefit due to the carry forward of
such Stub Period NOL (or portion thereof) to a taxable year or period of the Company and/or
Subsidiaries ending after the Closing Date, the Buyer will remit to Seller the amount of such Tax
Benefit within 10&nbsp;days after filing the Tax Return on which the Stub Period NOL is applied to
reduce Taxes for such taxable year or period. For the sake of clarity, the Seller shall not
receive any Tax Benefit from the carry forward of a Stub Period NOL to the extent that the amount
of the Stub Period NOL exceeds the amount of the aggregate deduction for Transaction Expenses. The
Buyer, the Company and Subsidiaries will as promptly

taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and for the portion through the

(the &#147;<U>Pre-Closing Tax Period</U>&#148;), and (ii)&nbsp;any and all Taxes of any other Person
imposed on the Company or a Subsidiary as a transferee or successor, by contract or
pursuant to any law, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the
Closing, in each case except to the extent that such Taxes have been paid or deposited
prior to the Closing Date or except to the extent that such Taxes are included in the

Company to defend, indemnify and hold the Seller harmless from and against all Losses
arising out of or related to all Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary for all taxable
periods ending after the Closing Date (except to the extent such taxable period began
before the Closing Date, in which case such indemnity will cover only that portion of any
such Taxes that are not allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period as determined under Section
9.03(e)(iii)).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a &#147;<U>Straddle Period</U>&#148;), the Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary for
the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be computed as follows: any Tax based directly or
indirectly on income or receipts and any credits, losses or deductions available with
respect to any Tax, shall be allocated by assuming that the relevant taxable period ended
on the Closing Date, and any other Tax shall be allocated based on a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the taxable period. Any credit
or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be prorated
based upon the method employed in this paragraph, taking into account the type of Tax to
which the refund relates. All determinations necessary to effect the foregoing

proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim and, without limiting the foregoing, may pursue
or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any
applicable governmental Persons with respect thereto, and may, either pay the Tax claimed and sue
for a refund where applicable law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any
permissible manner; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party will consult with the Tax
Indemnified Party in the negotiation and settlement of any Tax Claim and the Tax Indemnifying Party
will not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, settle or compromise any Tax Claim in any manner if such settlement or
compromise would have the effect of increasing the Taxes of the Tax Indemnified Party
(&#147;<U>Indemnified Party Tax Increase</U>&#148;); <U>provided</U>, however, that the consent of the
Indemnified Party will not be required if the Tax Indemnifying Party indemnifies the Indemnified

any Tax Claim, which cooperation will include the retention and (upon the Tax Indemnifying Party&#146;s
request) the provision to the Tax Indemnifying Party of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to

Returns as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless a final determination by a relevant taxing
