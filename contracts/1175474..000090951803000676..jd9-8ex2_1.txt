          Expenses, Accrued Other Taxes Adjustment and EBITDA Deduction and the
          resulting Purchase Price (the "Closing Financial Statements") of the
          Company as 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the day immediately prior to
          the Closing Date, determined in accordance with Sections 2(b) and 2(c)
          above. The Closing Financial Statements will also include a detailed
          statement prepared by Buyer setting forth Buyer's determination of the
          EBITDA Deduction. The Closing Financial Statements shall be fully
          supported by appropriate schedules and work papers. Buyer will deliver
          the Closing Financial Statements to the Sellers' Representative within
          sixty (60) days after the Closing Date. The Sellers' Representative
          shall have thirty (30) days following receipt of the Closing Financial
          Statements to give written notice to Buyer of any objection to the
          Closing Financial Statements. Any such written notice shall specify in
          reasonable detail those items or amounts as to which the Sellers'
          Representative disagrees (the "Disputed Items") and Sellers'
          Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and
          amounts contained in the Closing Financial Statements except for such
          other items or amounts which are impacted by any Disputed Item or the


                                       13
<PAGE>
          resolution of any Disputed Item. If, within such thirty (30) day
          period the Sellers' Representative has not given Buyer written notice
          of its objection to the Closing Financial Statements, then the
          Purchase Price reflected in the Closing Financial Statements shall be
          final and binding on the Parties. If the Sellers' Representative gives
          such notice of objection, then the Parties shall attempt in good faith
          to resolve the Disputed Items for a period not less than ten (10)
          days. If the parties are unable to resolve the Disputed Items after
          such ten (10) day period, then the Disputed Items will be submitted
          for resolution in accordance with the terms hereof, including Sections
          2(b) and (c), to the Chicago office of Deloitte & Touche, LLP,
          certified public accountants, or, if Deloitte & Touche, LLP is
          unwilling or unable to accept such appointment, then to a nationally
          recognized independent accounting firm which is mutually agreeable to
          Buyer and the Sellers' Representative (the "Accountants"). If Buyer
          and the Sellers' Representative cannot agree on a nationally
          recognized independent accounting firm to serve as the Accountants,
          then Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall request the American
          Arbitration Association appoint such firm, and such appointment shall
          be conclusive and binding on the Parties. If the Disputed Items are
          submitted to the Accountants for resolution, (A) the Accountants shall
          function as an expert and not as an arbitrator; (B) each Party will
          furnish to the Accountants such workpapers and other documents and
          information relating to the Disputed Items as the Accountants may
          request and are available to that Party (or its independent public
          accountants), and will be afforded the opportunity to present to the
          Accountants any material relating to the Disputed Items and to discuss
          the Disputed Items with the Accountants; (C) the Accountants shall be
          bound by the provisions of this Section 2; (D) the Accountants shall
          make a determination only with respect to the Disputed Items and may
          not assign a value to any Disputed Item greater than the highest value
          for such Disputed Item claimed by either Party or less than the
          smallest value for such Disputed Item claimed by either Party; (E) the
          determination by the Accountants, as set forth in a notice delivered
          to both Parties by the Accountants, will be binding and conclusive on
          the Parties; and (F) Buyer and Sellers will each bear fifty percent
          (50%) of the fees of the Accountants for such determination.

               (ii) Not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the
          final determination of the Purchase Price in accordance with Section
          2(f)(i), (A) if the Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated
          Purchase Price, Buyer will pay the difference thereof and the Escrow
          Agent will distribute the Purchase Price Escrow Amount in accordance
          with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, to an account designated by
          the Sellers' Representative for further distribution by the Sellers'
          Representative to Sellers and Option Payees, and (B) if the Estimated
          Purchase Price is greater than the Purchase Price, then such
          difference shall be deducted from the Purchase Price Escrow Amount and
          distributed by the Escrow Agent to Buyer in accordance with the terms
          of the Escrow Agreement; provided that (x) if the excess of the
          Estimated Purchase Price over the Purchase Price is greater than the
          Purchase Price Escrow Amount, then Sellers shall pay the difference
          thereof to Buyer in cash by wire transfer to an account designated by
          Buyer, and (y) all such amounts payable by Sellers to Buyer pursuant
          to clause (x) above shall be the joint and several obligation of
          Sellers; provided further, that if the excess of the Estimated
          Purchase Price over the Purchase Price is less than the Purchase Price
          Escrow Amount, then the remainder of the Purchase Price Escrow Amount
          not distributable to Buyer shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to


                                       14
<PAGE>
          the Sellers' Representative for further distribution by the Sellers'
          Representative to Sellers and Option Payees. Buyer and Sellers will
          cause the Escrow Agent to disburse the Purchase Price Escrow Amount in
          accordance with the resolution or determination of the Purchase Price
          as set forth herein.

obligations of the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby

Buyer and Sellers) (the "Escrow Agreement"), and Buyer will deliver and pay to
the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Amount to be held and distributed in accordance

          accordance with the terms thereof, are in an amount necessary to fund
          the Purchase Price in connection with the transactions contemplated
          hereby. True and correct copies of the executed Commitment Letters are

          aware of any facts or circumstances with respect to the Company, Buyer
          or its lenders under the Commitment Letters that create a reasonable
          basis for Buyer to believe that Buyer would not be able to obtain the
          financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters.

          Leased Real Property) used by the Company or to which the Company is
          bound or by which any of its properties or assets are bound (the
          "Leases"). The Company has delivered or otherwise made available to
          Buyer true, correct and complete copies of all Leases, together with
          all amendments, modifications or supplements thereto. The Company has

          other party thereto, and no event has occurred that with the lapse of
          time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a default
          thereunder.

               (ii) The Company has good title to, or a valid leasehold interest
          in, the properties and assets, whether tangible or intangible, used by
          it, located on its premises, or shown on the Most Recent Balance Sheet
          or acquired after the date thereof, free and clear of all Liens,
          except for properties and assets disposed of in the Ordinary Course of
          Business since the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet. Such

          the businesses of the Company as presently conducted in all material
          respects.

the number of shares of its authorized capital stock, the number and class of
shares thereof duly issued and outstanding, the names of all stockholders or
other equity owners and the number of shares of stock owned by each stockholder
or the amount of equity owned by each equity owner. The outstanding shares of
capital stock or equity interests of each Subsidiary are validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable, and all such shares or other equity interests
represented as being owned by the Company are owned by it free and clear of any
and all Liens. There is no existing option, warrant, call, right or Contract to
which any Subsidiary is a party requiring, and there are no convertible
securities of any Subsidiary outstanding which upon conversion would require,
the issuance of any shares of capital stock or other equity interests of any
Subsidiary or other securities convertible into shares of capital stock or other
equity interests of any Subsidiary.

          complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws relating to
          the payment and withholding of Taxes and has duly and timely withheld

          Disclosure Schedule), and there are no other audits or to the

          received any notice from any taxing authority that it intends to
          conduct such an audit or investigation or that any claim for unpaid
          Taxes has become a Lien of any kind against the property of the
          Company or is being asserted against the Company. No issue has been
          raised by any taxing authority in any current or prior examination
          which, by application of the same or similar principles, could
          reasonably be expected to result in a proposed deficiency for any
          subsequent taxable period.

               (iii) Section 4(k)(iii) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all
          federal, state, local and foreign franchise, sales or Income Tax

          lists all franchise, sales and Income Taxes paid for taxable periods
          ended on or after December 31, 2000. No claim has been made by a
          taxing authority in a jurisdiction where the Company does not file Tax
          Returns such that it is or may be subject to taxation by that
          jurisdiction. Buyer has received complete copies of all franchise and
          Income Tax Returns and all audit reports issued within the last three
          (3) years with respect to such Tax Returns. The Company has not waived
          any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or requested or agreed

          deficiency.

Knowledge of the Company and Sellers, no product or service sold, leased,
rented, provided or delivered by the Company to customers on or prior to the
Closing Date pursuant to a Contract which provides for annual payments in excess

any transaction, maintained any bank account or used any funds except for
transactions, bank accounts and funds which have been and are reflected in the
normally maintained books and records of the Company. The Company has
established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are
commercially reasonable and, to the Knowledge of the Company and Sellers, such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the
Company's principal executive officer or its principal financial officer to
material information which such principal officers and independent auditors deem
necessary to be provided to them.

          the tax structure and tax treatment of such transactions; provided,

of warranty or breach of covenant.

Sellers will cause the Company not to) (i) solicit, initiate or encourage the

           (a) General. In case at any time after the Closing any further action
is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the Parties
will take such further action (including the execution and delivery of such
further instruments and documents) as any other Party reasonably may request,
all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party (unless the requesting
Party is entitled to indemnification thereof under Section 8 below or to the
extent that such costs and expenses would constitute Transaction Expenses).

           (b) Litigation Support. In the event that and for so long as any
Party actively is contesting or defending against any Legal Proceeding in
connection with (i) any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii)
any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,


                                       41
<PAGE>
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act or transaction on or prior
to the Closing Date involving Company, each of the other Parties (if and only to
the extent that neither (A) such other Party or Parties are not adverse to the
contesting or defending party in such Legal Proceeding nor (B) the contesting or
defending Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under Section 8 below),
will cooperate with him, her or it and his, her or its counsel in the contest or
defense, make available their personnel and provide such testimony and access to
their books and records as shall be necessary in connection with the contest or
defense, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party.

           (c) D & O Insurance. Buyer will cause the Company to purchase a three
(3) year extension of the Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance
policy; provided, that, the cost of such extension shall not exceed 150% of the
current annual premium of such policy; provided, however, in the event the cost
exceeds such amount, Buyer shall cause the Company to purchase as favorable a
policy as possible at such price, or, at the election of Sellers, Sellers may
pay such additional cost so that a three (3) year extension of the current
policy is purchased.

           (d) Severance Pay Plan. Buyer will cause the Company for a period of
one (1) year following the Closing to maintain a severance pay plan
substantially in the form of Section 6(d) of the Disclosure Schedule.

           (e) Transition. For a period of two (2) years following the Closing,
no Seller will, directly or indirectly, take any action that is designed or
intended to have the effect of discouraging any lessor, licensor, customer,
supplier, or other business associate of the Company from maintaining the same
business relationships with the Company after the Closing as it maintained with
the Company prior to the Closing.

           (f) Confidentiality. Sellers will treat and hold as confidential all
Confidential Information, refrain from using any Confidential Information except
in connection with this Agreement and any other commercially reasonable
non-competition purpose (including preparation of Tax Returns) and, at the
request of Buyer, deliver promptly to Buyer or destroy all tangible embodiments
(and all copies) of Confidential Information in their possession, other than
with respect to Confidential Information being used solely for commercially
reasonable non-competition purposes (including the preparation of Tax Returns),
which may be retained for so long as such Confidential Information is being used
solely for such purposes. In the event that any Seller is requested or required
pursuant to oral or written question or request for information or documents in
any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or
similar process to disclose any Confidential Information, such Seller will
notify Buyer promptly of the request or requirement so that Buyer may seek an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
Section 6(f). If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver hereunder, any Seller is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose
any Confidential Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt,
such Seller may disclose the Confidential Information to the tribunal; provided,
however, such Seller will use her, his or its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, at the reasonable request and expense of Buyer, an order or other
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the
Confidential Information required to be disclosed as Buyer will designate.

          any Person or entity (whether as director, officer, employee, agent,
          representative, security holder, equity owner, partner, member,
          consultant or otherwise) engaged in any way in any businesses
          currently conducted by the Company; provided, however, that ownership
          of less than three percent (3%) of the outstanding stock of any
          publicly-traded corporation will not be deemed engagement in any of
          its businesses; and, provided further, that nothing herein shall
          prohibit John D. DePaul from maintaining his ownership interest and
          other relationship with L.P.P.R., Inc., so long as L.P.P.R., Inc. (or
          any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates) does not, directly or
          indirectly, compete with the Company. If the final judgment of a court
          of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
          Section 6(g) is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the
          court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability will
          have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or
          provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any
          invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision
          that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the
          intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
          Agreement will be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of
          the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

               (ii) Without limiting the generality of Section 6(g)(i) above,
          each Seller further agrees that during the Restricted Period, such
          Seller will not, directly or indirectly, cause, solicit, induce or in
          any manner encourage (A) any independent contractor, producer,
          customer, licensor, supplier, agent or business partner of the
          Company, to terminate or adversely change her, his or its relationship
          with the Company or (B) any present employee of the Company or an
          employee during the Restricted Period, to leave the employ of the
          Company or hire, employ or otherwise engage any such individual;
          provided that the restrictions set forth in this paragraph (ii) shall
          not apply to William Love.

               (iii) The covenants and undertakings contained in this Section
          6(g) relate to matters which are of a special, unique and
          extraordinary character and a violation of any of the terms of this
          Section 6(g) will cause irreparable injury to the parties, the amount
          of which will be impossible to estimate or determine and which cannot
          be adequately compensated. Therefore, Buyer will be entitled to an
          injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief from any court
          of competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this Section
          6(g). The rights and remedies provided by this Section 6(g) are
          cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies which
          Buyer may have hereunder or at law or in equity. Buyer and Sellers
          acknowledge that the Purchase Price represents fair and adequate
          consideration for all the Company Shares and accordingly, no portion
          of the Purchase Price is allocable to the foregoing covenant.

               against any Damages resulting from or caused by the failure of
               any representation or warranty contained in Section 4 to be true
               and correct in all respects as of the date made (other than the
               representations and warranties contained in Sections 4(b), (d),
               (f), (k) and (x) and subsection (i)(A) of Section 4(l) above)

               reason of such breach in excess of an amount equal to Five
               Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (the "Basket Amount") (after
               which, Sellers will only be obligated to indemnify the Buyer
               Indemnified Parties from and against all such Damages to the
               extent such Damages exceed, in the aggregate, the Basket Amount)

               shall be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties
               with respect the failure of the representations and warranties of
               Sellers contained in Section 4 to be true and correct in all
               respects as of the date made (other than the representations and

               Million Dollars ($10,000,000) and, with respect to the
               representations and warranties contained in Section 4(x), shall
               be limited to fifty percent (50%) of the Purchase Price and,
               further, with respect to the representations and warranties
               contained in Sections 4(b), (d), (f) and (k) shall be limited to
               one hundred percent (100%) of the Purchase Price.

                    (B) any and all Damages resulting from, arising out of or
               caused by the breach of any covenant or other agreement contained
               in this Agreement (other than the covenants contained in Sections
               2(a) and Section 6 above);

                    (C) any and all Transaction Expenses (except to the extent
               that such are deducted from the Purchase Price in accordance with
               Section 2(b) or have been paid prior to the Closing); and

                    (D) any and all Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries
               with respect to any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing
               Date and the pre-Closing portion of any Tax period beginning
               before and ending after the Closing Date (determined as provided
               in Section 10(p)(viii)), and any and all Damages with respect
               thereof; provided, however, that in the case of Taxes which would
               have constituted Accrued Other Taxes had such Taxes been finally
               determined to be due and payable as of the day before the Closing
               Date, such indemnity shall not exceed the excess, if any, of (x)
               fifty percent (50%) of such Taxes over (y) the Accrued Other
               Taxes Adjustment, and any and all Damages with respect thereof.

<PAGE>
               (ii) Each Seller shall severally (and not jointly and severally)
          indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from
          and against any and all Damages resulting from, arising out of or
          caused by (A) the breach of such Seller's individual covenants
          contained in Section 2(a) or Section 6 above or (B) the failure of
          such Seller's representations and warranties contained in Section 3(a)
          above to be true and correct in all respects as of the date made;
          provided that Buyer makes a written claim for indemnification against
          such Seller pursuant to Section 10(h) below within the applicable
          survival period, if any, set forth in Section 8(a).

               (iii) Any Damages payable hereunder shall be (A) reduced for
          Income Tax benefits actually recognized by the Buyer Indemnified
          Parties as a result of the event giving rise to payments hereunder for
          such Damages and increased for any Taxes actually incurred by the
          Buyer Indemnified Parties as a result of the receipt of payments
          hereunder for such Damages, and (B) calculated net of any insurance
          proceeds actually received by Buyer or the Company in respect thereof.

               (iv) Sellers shall have no recourse against the Company or its
          directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents, attorneys,
          representatives, assigns or successors for any indemnification claims
          asserted by the Buyer Indemnified Parties.

           (c) Indemnification Provisions for Sellers' Benefit. In the event
Buyer breaches any of its representations, warranties and covenants contained
herein and provided that any Seller makes a written claim for indemnification
against Buyer pursuant to Section 10(h) below within the survival period (if
there is an applicable survival period pursuant to Section 8(a) above), then
Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Seller, its trustees,
heirs and agents, and any successors to Seller's interests and their trustees,
heirs and agents (the "Seller Indemnified Parties") from and against the
entirety of any Damages suffered resulting from or caused by the breach.

           (d) Matters Involving Third Parties.

               (i) If any third party shall notify any Party (the "Indemnified
          Party") with respect to any matter (a "Third-Party Claim") which may
          give rise to a claim for indemnification against any other Party (the
          "Indemnifying Party") under this Section 8, then the Indemnified Party
          shall promptly notify each Indemnifying Party thereof in writing;
          provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party
          in notifying any Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying
          Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the
          extent) the Indemnifying Party thereby is actually and materially
          prejudiced.

               (ii) (A) Except as provided in clause (B) below, any Indemnifying
          Party will have the right to assume the defense of the Third-Party
          Claim with counsel of his or its choice reasonably satisfactory to the
          Indemnified Party at any time within thirty (30) days after the


                                       48
<PAGE>
          Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third-Party Claim; provided,
          however, that the Indemnifying Party must conduct the defense of the
          Third-Party Claim actively and diligently thereafter in order to
          preserve its rights in this regard.

                    (B) Buyer shall have the exclusive right to control the
               conduct of any Third Party Claim with respect to Taxes; provided,
               however, that, in the case of a Third Party Claim with respect to
               Taxes that Sellers are liable or responsible for under Section 8
               or otherwise, (i) Buyer shall keep the Sellers' Representative
               reasonably informed and consult seriously and in good faith with
               the Sellers' Representative and its tax advisors with respect to
               any issue relating to such Third Party Claim; (ii) Buyer shall
               promptly provide the Sellers' Representative with copies of all
               correspondence, notices and other written materials received from
               any taxing authorities and shall on a current basis otherwise
               keep the Sellers' Representative and its tax advisors advised of
               significant developments in the Third Party Claim and of
               significant communications involving representatives of the
               taxing authorities with respect to the Third Party Claim; (iii)
               the Sellers' Representative may request that Buyer take a
               position in respect of such Third Party Claim, and Buyer shall do
               so provided that (A) there exists substantial authority for such
               position within the meaning of the accuracy-related penalty
               provisions of Section 6662 of the Code and (B) the adoption of
               such position would not adversely affect the Tax liability of
               Buyer or any of its Affiliates for any post-Closing period or
               portion thereof (unless the Sellers' Representative agrees on
               behalf of Sellers to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its
               Affiliates from and against such adverse effect); (iv) Buyer
               shall provide the Sellers' Representative with a copy of any
               written submission to be sent to a taxing authority prior to the
               submission thereof (with reasonable time for review by the
               Sellers' Representative and its tax advisors) and shall give
               serious and good faith consideration to any comments or suggested
               revisions that the Sellers' representative or its tax advisors
               may have with respect thereto; and (v) there shall be no
               settlement, resolution, or closing or other agreement with
               respect thereto without the consent of the Sellers'
               Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld
               or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the withholding of
               consent will not be regarded as unreasonable if the Sellers'
               Representative receives, and provides Buyer a copy of, written
               advice from a tax advisor reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that
               there is a significant probability that, by pursuing the dispute
               further, Buyer could obtain a more favorable outcome (taking into
               account both pre-Closing and post-Closing Tax periods of the
               Company and its Affiliates) than that reflected in the proposed
               settlement, resolution, or closing or other agreement.

               (iii) So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed and is
          conducting the defense of the Third-Party Claim in accordance with
          Section 8(d)(ii) above, (A) the Indemnifying Party will not consent to
          the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to
          the Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
          Indemnified Party (not to be withheld unreasonably) unless the
          judgment or proposed settlement involves only the payment in full of
          money damages by one or more of the Indemnifying Parties and does not
          impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified


                                       49
<PAGE>
          Party and (B) the Indemnified Party will not consent to the entry of
          any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the
          Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
          Indemnifying Party (not to be withheld unreasonably). The Parties
          hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the
          defense, negotiation or settlement of any Third Party Claim.

               (iv) In the event none of the Indemnifying Parties assumes and
          conducts the defense of the Third-Party Claim in accordance with
          Section 8(d)(ii) above, however, (A) the Indemnified Party may defend
          against and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
          settlement with respect to, the Third-Party Claim in any manner he or
          it reasonably may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not
          consult with, or obtain any consent from, any Indemnifying Party in
          connection therewith) and (B) the Indemnifying Parties will remain
          responsible for any Damages the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting
          from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of or caused by the
          Third-Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this Section 8.

           (e) Direct Claims. With respect to any claim by an Indemnified Party
for Damages not involving a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") the Indemnified
Party and Indemnifying Party shall attempt in good faith to resolve any issues
in dispute with respect to such Direct Claim following the delivery of a notice
relating to a Direct Claim. In the event the parties are unable to resolve the
issues in dispute, the Indemnified Party will be free to pursue such remedies as
may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the
provisions of this Section 8.

           (f) Exclusive Remedy. Buyer and Sellers acknowledge and agree that,
following the Closing, the foregoing indemnification provisions in this Section
8 shall be the exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and Seller
Indemnified Parties with respect to the Company, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with respect to any claims
or causes of actions for fraud and/or intentional misrepresentation by a Party
and to any adjustment to the Purchase Price in accordance with Section 2 hereof.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Buyer Indemnified Parties
waive any statutory, equitable, or common law rights or remedies relating to any
Environmental Requirements or any Environmental Claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Party shall be precluded from bringing an action for specific
performance or other equitable remedy to require a Party to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

           (g) Escrow Agreement. Any amount in respect of Damages to which any
Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to receive under this Section 8 shall
initially be disbursed from the Indemnity Escrow Amount in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement until the entire Indemnity Escrow Amount has been
disbursed.

           (h) Adjustment to Purchase Price. The Parties agree to treat all
payments made under Section 8 as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes, unless a contrary treatment is required by applicable Law.

           9. Termination.

           (a) Termination of Agreement. Certain of the Parties may terminate
this Agreement as provided below:

               (i) Buyer and the Sellers' Representative may terminate this
          Agreement by mutual written consent at any time prior to the Closing;

               (ii) Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice
          to Sellers' Representative at any time prior to the Closing (A) in the
          event either the Company or any Seller has breached any
          representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement in
          any material respect, Buyer has notified Sellers' Representative of
          the breach and the breach is incapable of being cured or, if capable
          of being cured, has continued without cure for a period of twenty (20)
          days after the notice of breach or (B) if the Closing shall not have
          occurred on or before November 6, 2003 by reason of the failure of any
          condition precedent under Section 7(a) hereof (unless the failure
          results primarily from Buyer itself breaching any representation,
          warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement); and

               (iii) Sellers' Representative may terminate this Agreement by
          giving written notice to Buyer at any time prior to the Closing (A) in
          the event Buyer has breached any representation, warranty or covenant
          contained in this Agreement in any material respect, the Sellers'
          Representative has notified Buyer of the breach and the breach is
          incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, has continued
          without cure for a period of twenty (20) days after the notice of
          breach or (B) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before
          November 6, 2003, by reason of the failure of any condition precedent
          under Section 7(b) hereof (unless the failure results primarily from
          any Seller breaching any representation, warranty or covenant
          contained in this Agreement).

           (b) Effect of Termination. If any Party terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9(a) above, all rights and obligations of the Parties
hereunder shall terminate without any liability of any Party to any other Party
(except for any liability of any Party then in breach); provided, however, that
the confidentiality provisions contained in Section 5(e) above and Section 10
shall survive termination.

           10. Miscellaneous.

           (a) Nature of Sellers' Obligations.

               (i) The covenants of each Seller in Section 2(a) above concerning
          the sale of his, her or its Company Shares to Buyer (but not with
          respect to the payment of any adjustment to the Purchase Price to the
          extent such adjustment exceeds the Purchase Price Escrow Amount), the
          representations and warranties of each Seller in Section 3(a) above
          concerning the transaction and the covenants of each Seller contained
          in Section 6 above are individual obligations. This means that the
          particular individual Seller making the representation, warranty or
          covenant shall be solely responsible to the extent provided in Section
          8(b)(ii) above for any Damages Buyer may suffer as a result of any
          breach thereof.


                                       51
<PAGE>
               (ii) The remainder of the representations, warranties and
          covenants in this Agreement are joint and several obligations. This
          means that each Seller shall be responsible to the extent provided in
          Section 8(b)(i) above for the entirety of any Damages any of the Buyer
          Indemnified Parties may suffer as a result of any breach thereof.

           (b) Press Releases and Public Announcements. No Party shall issue any
press release or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement prior to the Closing without the prior written approval of Buyer
and Sellers' Representative; provided, however, that any Party may make any
public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by applicable Law or any
listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly traded securities (in which
case the disclosing Party will use its best efforts to advise the other Parties
of such belief and provide the other Parties with an opportunity to review and
comment upon prior to making the disclosure); provided, however, that Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that (i) (A) Buyer will issue a press release
announcing, and will subsequently file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission a current report on Form 8-K and a quarterly report on Form 10-Q that
will discuss the transactions contemplated herein, and (B) the transactions
contemplated herein may be disclosed in any offering or information memorandum
or other similar document and in any "roadshow" or syndication presentations or
other marketing materials prepared in connection with Buyer's financing of the
transactions contemplated herein; and (ii) Buyer shall afford Sellers'
Representative ample time to review and comment upon, and provide written
approval of such discussions and disclosures as contemplated by the first clause
of this Section 10(b) (other than Buyer's Form 8-K and Form 10-Q).

           (c) No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as set forth in Section 8
hereof, this Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person
other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

           (d) Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents
referred to herein) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements
or representations by or among the Parties, written or oral, to the extent they
relate in any way to the subject matter hereof.

           (e) Succession and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement or
any of his or its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior
written approval of Buyer and the Sellers' Representative; provided, however,
that Buyer may (i) assign any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to
one or more Affiliates or to any Person providing Buyer with financing relating
to the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) designate one or more of its
Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder (in any or all of which cases
Buyer nonetheless will remain responsible for the performance of all of its
obligations hereunder) and (iii) assign its rights, whether in whole or in part,
under Section 6(g) or Section (8) hereunder to any Person that is a successor
(whether through stock purchase, merger, transfer of assets or otherwise) to the
Company's Lehigh Direct division or Lehigh Lithographers division.

               (i) Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. This
          Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
          domestic laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any
          choice or conflicts of law provision or rule (whether of the State of
          New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
          of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. EACH
          PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
          UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
          ISSUES, AND, THEREFORE, EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
          UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
          LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT TO ANY
          LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN
          CONNECTION WITH OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES
          AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT, OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
          OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
          PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
          ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
          CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES
          THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
          INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
          CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10(I).

           (j) Amendments and Waivers. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Buyer
and Sellers. No waiver by any Party of any provision of this Agreement or any
default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and
signed by the Party making such waiver nor shall such waiver be deemed to extend
to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or
covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any
prior or subsequent such occurrence.

           (k) Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction.

           (l) Expenses. Each of Buyer and the Sellers will bear his, her or its
own costs and expenses (including investment banking and legal fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (it being understood that any costs and expenses of Sellers
which are not paid by the Company prior to the Closing but remain as obligations
of the Company will be deducted from the Purchase Price as Transaction Expenses
as provided in Section 2 above). Buyer and the Company shall each pay one-half
of the filing fees in connection with the notification filing under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Buyer agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to assist Sellers in minimizing any costs, fees, penalties, premiums, payments
or expenses referred to in clause (v) in the definition of "Transaction
Expenses" in Section 1 hereof. Buyer or its affiliates (or the Company following
the Closing) shall pay all costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with
Buyer's financing and the Commitment Letters and Sellers shall not be liable for
any such costs, fees or expenses and such amounts shall not be treated as
Transaction Expenses or as a deduction to the Purchase Price.


                                       54

           (m) Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local or
foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The
word "including" shall mean including without limitation.

           (n) Incorporation of Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules. The Exhibits,
Annexes and Schedules identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by
reference and made a part hereof.

           (o) Governing Language. This Agreement has been negotiated and
executed by the Parties in English. In the event any translation of this
Agreement is prepared for convenience or any other purpose, the provisions of
the English version shall prevail.

           (p) Cooperation on Tax Matters.

               (i) Sellers shall timely prepare or cause to be prepared and
          timely file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and
          any Subsidiary which are required to be filed on or prior to the
          Closing Date, and shall timely pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown
          due thereon. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
          consistent with prior practice (unless otherwise inconsistent with
          applicable Law). With respect to Tax Returns required to be filed
          during the period between the execution of this Agreement and the
          Closing, the Sellers' Representative shall cause the Company and its
          Subsidiaries to provide Buyer with copies of such completed Tax
          Returns at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date for filing
          thereof, along with supporting workpapers, for Buyer's review and
          approval (unless such twenty (20) day period is not feasible given the
          date of execution of this Agreement and the due date of the Tax
          Return, in which case, Sellers' Representative shall provide copies of
          such Tax Returns to Buyer as soon as practicable after execution of
          this Agreement), which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld (it
          being understood that so long as such Tax Returns are prepared on a
          basis consistent with past practice and substantial authority exists
          for the taking of a position on such Tax Returns, any withholding of
          Buyer's approval with respect to such Tax Returns shall be considered
          unreasonable). Sellers and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to
          resolve any disagreements regarding such Tax Returns prior to the due
          date for filing. In the event that Sellers and Buyer are unable to
          resolve any dispute with respect to such Tax Returns at least ten (10)
          days prior to the due date for filing (or such shorter period as
          contemplated above), such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to
          Section 10(p)(vii), which resolution shall be binding on the Parties.

               (ii) Sellers shall timely prepare or cause to be prepared and
          Buyer shall cooperate in good faith in timely filing or causing to be
          filed all Income Tax Returns for the Company and any Subsidiary which
          relate to Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and which
          are filed after the Closing Date, and, to the extent Sellers are
          obligated to indemnify for such Taxes under Section 8; Sellers shall
          timely pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown due thereon. All such


                                       55
<PAGE>
          Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior
          practice (unless otherwise inconsistent with applicable Law). Buyer
          will be provided with copies of such completed Tax Returns at least
          twenty (20) days prior to the due date for filing thereof, along with
          supporting workpapers for Buyer's review and approval, which approval
          shall not be unreasonably withheld (it being understood that so long
          as such Tax Return is prepared on a basis consistent with past
          practice and substantial authority exists for the taking of a position
          on such Tax Return, any withholding of Buyer's approval with respect
          to such Tax Return shall be considered unreasonable). Sellers and
          Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements
          regarding such Tax Returns prior to the due date for filing. In the
          event that Sellers and Buyer are unable to resolve any dispute with
          respect to such Tax Returns at least ten (10) days prior to the due
          date for filing, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section
          10(p)(vii), which resolution shall be binding on the Parties.

               (iii) (A) Except as provided above, following the Closing, Buyer
          shall timely prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or caused
          to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and any Subsidiary which
          are required to be filed after the Closing Date. With respect to any
          such Income Tax Return for a Straddle Period (as defined below), Buyer
          shall prepare such Income Tax Return in a manner consistent with prior
          practice (unless otherwise required by applicable Law) and permit
          Sellers to review and comment on each such Income Tax Return prior to
          filing. Sellers and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve any
          disagreements regarding such Income Tax Returns prior to the due date
          for filing. In the event Sellers and Buyer are unable to resolve any
          dispute with respect to such Income Tax Returns at least ten (10) days
          prior to the due date for filing, such dispute shall be resolved
          pursuant to Section 10(p)(vii), which resolution shall be binding on
          the Parties.

                    (B) In the event Buyer has the responsibility to cause to be
               filed any Tax Return pursuant to Section 10(p)(ii) or this
               Section 10(p)(iii) and to the extent, but only to the extent,
               Sellers are obligated to indemnify under Section 8 for any Taxes
               reflected on such Tax Return, Sellers' Representative, on behalf
               of the Sellers, shall no later than five (5) days prior to the
               due date for the payment of Taxes shown due on such Tax Return
               pay to Buyer the amount of any such Taxes for which Sellers are
               obligated to indemnify under Section 8, with respect to any Tax
               period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and the pre-Closing
               portion of any Tax period beginning before and ending after the
               Closing Date. No payment pursuant to this clause (B) shall excuse
               Sellers from their indemnification obligations pursuant to
               Section 8 if the amount of Taxes as ultimately determined (on
               audit or otherwise) for the periods covered by such Tax Returns
               exceeds the amount of Sellers' payment under this clause (B).

               (iv) Nothing contained in Section 10(p)(i), (ii) or (iii) shall
          excuse the Sellers from their indemnification obligations pursuant to
          Section 8 with respect to Taxes. Sellers shall be liable for and shall
          pay (and shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer Indemnified Parties
          against) any and all sales, use, stamp, documentary, filing,
          recording, transfer or similar fees or Taxes or governmental charges
          as levied by any Governmental Entity (including any interest and
          penalties) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
          Agreement (other than with respect to, or in connection with, any
          financing arrangement entered into by Buyer).

               (v) Any Income Tax refunds that are received by Buyer or the
          Company or any Subsidiary that relate to Income Tax periods or
          portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the
          account of Sellers, and Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the
          Sellers' Representative for the benefit of Sellers, as an additional
          amount of the Purchase Price, any such refund net of any Taxes, costs
          or expenses actually payable by Buyer or the Company with respect
          thereto within ten (10) days after receipt thereof; provided, however,
          that Buyer shall be entitled to retain any such refund to the extent
          such refund arises by reason of the carryback of any losses, credits
          or other Tax attributes generated in any Income Tax periods or
          portions thereof beginning after the Closing Date.

               (vi) Buyer, the Company and Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and
          to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection
          with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 10(p) and any
          audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes for such
          pre-Closing tax periods. Such cooperation shall include the retention
          and (upon the other Party's request) the provision of records and
          information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
          litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
          mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
          explanation of any material provided hereunder. Company and Sellers
          agree (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
          pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable
          period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
          statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or
          Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods and
          to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
          taxing authority and (B) to give the other Party reasonable written
          notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books
          and records and, if the other Party so requests, Company or Sellers,
          as the case may be, shall allow the other Party to take possession of
          such books and records.

               (vii) Any dispute as to any matter covered in this Section 10(p)
          shall be resolved by an independent accounting firm mutually
          acceptable to the Sellers' Representative and Buyer. The fees and
          expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by Sellers, on
          the one hand, and Buyer on the other. If any dispute with respect to a
          Tax Return is not resolved prior to the due date of such Tax Return,
          such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner which the party
          responsible for preparing such Tax Return deems correct.

               (viii) In the case of any Tax period that includes (but does not
          end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), Sellers and Buyer
          shall, unless prohibited by applicable Law, close the Tax period of
          the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the
          Closing Date. If applicable Law does not permit the Company or any of
          its Subsidiaries to close its Tax year on the Closing Date or in any
          case in which a Tax is assessed with respect to a Tax period which
          includes the Closing Date (but does not begin or end on that day), the
          Taxes, if any, attributable to such period shall be allocated (except
          as provided in the proviso to Section 8(b)(i)(D)) (A) to Sellers for


                                       57
<PAGE>
          the portion of such period up to and including the close of business
          on the Closing Date, and (B) to Buyer for the portion of such period
          subsequent to the Closing Date. Any allocation of income or deductions
          required to determine any Taxes attributable to any such period shall
          be made by means of a closing of the books and records of the Company
          and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Closing Date,
          provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated
          on an annual basis (other than depreciation and amortization
          deductions) shall be allocated between the portion of such period
          ending on the Closing Date and the portion of such period after the
          Closing in proportion to the number of days in each such portion of
          such period.

               (ix) It is agreed that any Income Tax deductions, credits or
          other Tax benefits arising from the payment or accrual of Transaction
          Expenses and the Option Cash Consideration shall, to the extent
          permitted under applicable Law, be reflected on the Company's Income
          Tax Return for the Tax period ending on the Closing Date. For purposes
          of clarity, Section 10(p)(ix) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
          list of such Transaction Expenses and Option Cash Consideration to
          which this Section 10(p)(ix) relates.

               (x) Following the Closing Buyer will not permit the Company to
          dispose or sell the Company's Lehigh Direct division until at least
          one business day following the Closing Date. In the event such a
          disposition is consummated, the Parties hereto agree that any Tax
          consequences arising from such disposition shall be properly allocated
          to any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date (as contemplated in
          Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or otherwise) or
          the Post-Closing portion of any Tax period beginning before and ending
          after the Closing Date.

           (q) Appointment of Sellers' Representative. Each Seller hereby
appoints Raymond A. Frick, Jr. or, in the event Raymond A. Frick, Jr. dies,
becomes disabled or is no longer able or willing to serve in such capacity, then
John D. DePaul (the "Sellers' Representative") to act as his, her or its agent
for the purposes of: (i) delivering to Buyer his, her or its respective Company
Shares; (ii) accepting from Buyer the payment of the immediately available funds
portion of the Purchase Price and distributing to each Seller his respective
portion of such funds; (iii) receiving any notice required or desired to be
given to Sellers by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement; (iv) changing the time,
date or place of the Closing; (v) granting any consent or waiver required or
desired of Sellers by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement; (vi) amending this
Agreement; (vii) terminating or agreeing to terminate this Agreement; (viii)
authorizing the distribution to Buyer of all or any portion of the Escrow Fund;
(ix) agreeing to, negotiating, entering into settlements and compromises of, and
agreeing to the payment to Buyer of any amounts in respect of Damages for which
Buyer is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to Section 8 hereof; (x) agreeing,
negotiating, entering into settlements and compromises with respect to the
calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price at Closing and to any post-Closing
adjustment to the Purchase Price, all in accordance with Section 2 hereof; and
(xi) executing all documents and delivering all documents contemplated by this
Agreement. Each Seller shall execute and have notarized a Power of Attorney to
the Sellers' Representative, which Power shall be irrevocable and coupled with
an interest for his appointment. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Sellers' Representative authorized hereunder shall constitute a decision for all
Sellers and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each Seller, and Buyer
may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers'
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of every such
Seller. Buyer is hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts
undertaken by Buyer in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction from the Sellers' Representative.
