The Merger

  

  

Section 2.01. The Merger. (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall
be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware
Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and
the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation")
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

  

  

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 as soon as
possible, but in any event no later than two Business Days after the date the
conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the
extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been
satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties
entitled to the benefits of such conditions, or at such other place, at such
other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree.

  

  

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate
of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate
of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later
time as may be agreed to by the parties and specified in the certificate of
merger).

  

  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the
obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and
Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of shares of Company
Stock or any holder of shares of common stock of Merger Subsidiary:

  

  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(c), each share of Company
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into the right to receive 2.8750 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of Parent Class
A Common Stock (together with the cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock as specified below, the "Merger Consideration"). As of
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and the right to receive any dividends or other distributions

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

pursuant to Section 2.03(f), in each case to be issued or paid in accordance
with Section 2.03, without interest.

  

  

(b) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(c) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned
by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  

  

Section 2.03. Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange
Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i)
certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") and
(ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"). At
or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange
Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and
the Uncertificated Shares. Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange
Agent from time to time, as needed, any dividends or distributions to which
any Person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.03(f) of this Agreement. Promptly
after the Effective Time, and in any event no later than the 10th Business Day
following the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange
Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares of Company Stock at the
Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions reasonably acceptable
to the Company (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent
and which shall otherwise be in customary form and shall include customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's message" regarding the
book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares) for use in such exchange.

  

  

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company
Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. The shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock constituting part of such Merger Consideration, at
Parent's option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical
certificate is required under Applicable Law. Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to
receive such Merger

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Consideration and the right to receive any dividends or other distributions
pursuant to Section 2.03(f).

  

  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

  

  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth, in this Article 2.

  

  

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Stock 12 months after the Effective Time shall be returned
to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of
Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section
2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for and Parent
shall remain liable for, payment of the Merger Consideration, and any
dividends and distributions with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.03(f),
in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock
for any amounts properly paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by holders of shares of Company Stock two years after the Effective Time (or
such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall
become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of Parent
constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares as provided in Section 2.06, shall be paid to the holder of
any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not
transferred until such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are surrendered
or transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section. Following
such surrender or transfer, there shall be paid, without interest, to the
Person in whose name the securities of Parent have been registered, (i) at the
time of such

surrender or transfer, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.06 and the
amount of all dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time previously paid or payable on the date of such surrender with
respect to such securities, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time and prior to surrender or transfer and with a payment date
subsequent to surrender or transfer payable with respect to such securities.

  

  

(g) The payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration,
value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred by a holder of Company Stock in connection with the Merger
for which none of Parent, the Company, or a Subsidiary of the Company or
Parent is liable, and the filing of any related Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to such Taxes and fees, shall be the sole
responsibility of such holder.

  

  

Section 2.04. Equity-Based Awards. (a) Except as provided in Section 2.04(d),
the terms of each outstanding compensatory option to purchase shares of
Company Stock (a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not exercisable or
vested, shall be adjusted as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time,
each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into an option (each, an "Adjusted Option") to acquire, on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock equal to the product of (i)the number of shares of
Company Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional
shares rounded down to the next lower whole number of shares. The exercise
price per share of Parent Class A Common Stock subject to any such Adjusted
Option will be an amount (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
quotient of (A) the exercise price per share of Company Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B)
the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional cents rounded up to the next higher
number of whole cents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the conversion of a
Company Stock Option in accordance with the preceding provisions of this
Section 2.04(a) would cause the related Adjusted Option to be treated as the
grant of new stock right for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, such
Company Stock Option shall not be converted in accordance with the preceding
provisions but shall instead be converted in a manner reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Company that would not cause the related Adjusted Option to be
treated as the grant of new stock right for purposes of Section 409A.

  

  

(b) Except as provided in Section 2.04(c) and Section 2.04(d), the terms of
each outstanding restricted stock unit or deferred stock unit that, in either
case, is settleable in shares of Company Stock (a "Company RSU"), whether or
not vested, shall be adjusted as necessary to provide that, at the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Effective Time, each Company RSU outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into a RSU (each, an "Adjusted RSU") to
acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
of Company Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional
shares rounded down to the next lower whole number of shares.

  

  

(c) At or promptly after the Effective Time, each outstanding Company RSU
(each, a "Director RSU") held by a non-employee director or former non-
employee director of the Company (each, a "Director"), whether or not vested,
shall be canceled, and the Company shall pay each such Director at or promptly
after the Effective Time for each such Director RSU an amount in cash computed
by first determining the Adjusted RSU that such Director would receive if the
Director RSU held by such Director was converted into an Adjusted RSU pursuant
to the methodology described in Section 2.04(b) (each, a "Notional Adjusted
RSU") and then multiplying (i) the closing sale price of a share of Parent
Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ on the trading day immediately preceding the
Effective Time by (ii) the number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock
with respect to the Notional Adjusted RSUs.

  

  

(d) (i) At or promptly after the Effective Time, each outstanding Company
Stock Option (each, a "Former Employee Option") held by a former employee or
individual contractor of the Company (each, a "Former Employee"), whether or
not exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled, and the Company shall pay each
such Former Employee at or promptly after the Effective Time for each such
Former Employee Option an amount in cash computed by first determining the
Adjusted Option that such Former Employee would receive if the Former Employee
Option held by such Former Employee was converted into an Adjusted Option
pursuant to the methodology described in Section 2.04(a) (each, a "Notional
Adjusted Option") and then multiplying (A) the excess of the closing sale
price of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ on the trading day
immediately preceding the Effective Time over the per share exercise price of
such Notional Adjusted Option, if any, by (B) the number of shares of Company
Stock subject to such Notional Adjusted Option to the extent unexercised. For
the avoidance of doubt, all Former Company Options outstanding as of the
Effective Time that have a per share exercise price equal to or exceeding the
closing sale price of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ on the
trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time shall be immediately
cancelled and forfeited without any liability on the part of the Surviving
Corporation or Parent.

  

  

(ii) At or promptly after the Effective Time, each outstanding Company RSU
(each, a "Former Employee RSU") held by a Former Employee, whether or not
vested, shall be canceled, and the Company shall pay each such Former Employee

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

at or promptly after the Effective Time for each such Former Employee RSU an
amount in cash computed by first determining the number of Notional Adjusted
RSUs held by such Former Employee and then multiplying (A) the closing sale
price of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ on the trading day
immediately preceding the Effective Time by (B) the number of shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock with respect to the Notional Adjusted RSUs.

  

  

(e) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of the
Company Stock Options and Company RSUs pursuant to Sections 2.04(a) and (b),
including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Class A Common Stock
as is necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section
2.04. Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
an appropriate form, or a post-effective amendment to a registration statement
previously filed under the 1933 Act, with respect to the shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Options and Company RSUs to
be assumed by Parent and, where applicable, shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time and to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement covering such Company Stock Options and Company
RSUs (and to maintain the current status of the prospectus contained therein)
for so long as any Company Stock Option or any Company RSU remains
outstanding. With respect to those individuals, if any, who, subsequent to the
Effective Time, will be subject to the reporting requirements under Section
16(a) of the 1934 Act, where applicable, Parent shall administer any Company
Stock Option and any Company RSU assumed pursuant to this Section 2.04 in a
manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act to the
extent such Company Stock Option or such Company RSU complied with such rule
prior to the Merger.

  

  

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any actions with
respect to equity compensation plans or arrangements that are necessary to
give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.04.

  

  

Section 2.05. Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company or Parent shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period,
or any other similar event, but excluding any change that results from (a) the
exercise of stock options or other equity awards to purchase shares of Parent
Stock or Company Stock or the settlement of restricted stock units or deferred
stock units or (b) the grant of equity-based compensation to directors or
employees of Parent or, subject to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Company under Parent's or the Company's, as applicable, equity
compensation plans or arrangements, the Merger

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Consideration, amounts payable under Section 2.04 and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement, as applicable, shall be appropriately and
proportionately adjusted.

  

  

Section 2.06. Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock that a holder of shares of Company Stock would otherwise be
entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated and if a
fractional share results from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled
to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash without interest determined by
multiplying the closing sale price of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock
on NASDAQ on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time by the
fraction of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise have been entitled.

  

  

Section 2.07. Withholding. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to
the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall be entitled to deduct or withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it is
required to deduct or withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, assist Parent in making such
deductions and withholding as reasonably requested by Parent. If the Exchange
Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds
amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Stock in respect of
which the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may
be, made such deduction and withholding.

  

  

Section 2.08. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate and any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.03(f), as
contemplated by this Article 2.

19  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 3.02. Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company shall
be amended to be identical to the bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time and as so amended shall be the bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with
Delaware Law.

shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of
the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving

State of Delaware and has all corporate powers and all Governmental
Authorizations required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for
those Governmental Authorizations the absence of which would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is
necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Prior to the date hereof, the Company has
delivered or made available to Parent true and complete copies of the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the
date of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 4.02. Corporate Authorization. (a) The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby are within the Company's corporate powers and, except for the required
approval of the Company's stockholders in connection with the consummation of
the Merger, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of the Company. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Stock (the "Company Stockholder Approval") is
the only vote of the holders of any of the Company's capital stock necessary
in connection with the consummation of the Merger. This Agreement, assuming
due

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

  

  

authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Subsidiary, and the
Voting Agreement, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the
stockholders party thereto, constitute a valid and binding agreement of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms
(subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and general principles of equity).

  

  

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, as of the date of this Agreement, the
Company's Board of Directors has (i) unanimously determined that this
Agreement and the Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Company's
stockholders, (ii) unanimously approved and declared advisable this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) unanimously resolved,

stockholders (such recommendation, the "Company Board Recommendation").

  

  

Section 4.03. Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than (i) the
filing of a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with the Delaware
Secretary of State and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of
other states in which the Company is qualified to do business, (ii) compliance

Laws, (iii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the Communications
Act and non-U.S. Applicable Law governing the regulation of cable television,
telecommunications and broadcasting, (iv) authorizations from state public
utility commissions and similar state authorities having jurisdiction over the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (v) compliance with any state
statutes or local franchise ordinances and agreements, (vi) compliance with
any applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act and any other
applicable state or federal securities laws, (vii) compliance with any
applicable requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") and (viii)
any actions or filings the absence of which would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect
or materially interfere with or delay the consummation of the Merger.

  

  

Section 4.04. Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will not (i)
contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (ii)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.03, contravene,
conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any
Applicable Law, (iii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
Section 4.03, require any consent or other action by any Person under,
constitute a default, or an

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

  

  

event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute
a default, under, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation,
acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the loss of any
benefit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any
provision of any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any license, franchise, permit, certificate, approval
or other similar authorization affecting, or relating in any way to, the
assets or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (iv) result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien, other than any Permitted Lien, on any
asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with only such exceptions, in
the case of each of clauses (ii) through (iv), as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect or materially interfere with or delay the consummation of the Merger.

  

  

Section 4.05. Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 8,333,333,333 shares of Company Stock and 1,000,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.01, of the Company. As of February 10, 2014,
there were outstanding (A) 276,825,317 shares of Company Stock, (B) Company
Stock Options to purchase an aggregate of 7,474,354 shares of Company Stock at

were exercisable), (C) Company RSUs to acquire an aggregate of 3,967,053

authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. No Subsidiary of the Company owns any shares of capital
stock of the Company or any Company Securities.

  

  

(b) There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of
the Company having the right to vote on an as-converted basis (or convertible
into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters
on which stockholders of the Company may vote. As of February 10, 2014, except
as set forth in this Section 4.05 and for changes since such date resulting
from the exercise of Company Stock Options or the settlement of Company RSUs,
in each case outstanding on such date, there are no issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding (i) shares of capital stock or other voting securities
of or other ownership interests in the Company, (ii) securities of the Company
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of or other ownership interests in the Company, (iii) warrants,
calls, options or other rights to acquire from the Company, or other
obligation of the Company to issue, any shares of capital stock, voting
securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or
other voting securities of or other ownership interests in the Company or (iv)
restricted shares, stock appreciation rights, performance units, contingent
value rights, "phantom" stock

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

  

  

or similar securities or rights issued or granted by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that are derivative of, or provide economic benefits based,
directly or indirectly, on the value or price of, any shares of capital stock
or other voting securities of or other ownership interests in the Company (the
items in clauses (i) through (iv) being referred to collectively as the
"Company Securities"). There are no outstanding obligations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the
Company Securities, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
sponsored an employee stock purchase plan. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any voting trust, proxy, voting agreement or other
similar agreement with respect to the voting of any Company Securities.

  

  

Section 4.06. Subsidiaries. (a) Each Subsidiary of the Company is an entity
duly incorporated or otherwise duly organized, validly existing and (where
applicable) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization, except where the failure to be so incorporated,
organized, existing or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each Subsidiary of the Company has all corporate, limited liability company or
comparable powers and all Governmental Authorizations required to carry on its
business as now conducted, except for those powers or Governmental
Authorizations the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each such
Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except
for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Section 4.06(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies
all "significant subsidiaries" (as defined under Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation
S-X promulgated pursuant to the 1934 Act) (each, a "Significant Subsidiary")
of the Company and their respective jurisdictions of organization

  

  

(b) All of the outstanding capital stock or other voting securities of or
other ownership interests in each Subsidiary of the Company, are owned by the
Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of any
other limitation or restriction (including any restriction on the right to
vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other voting
securities or other ownership interests). There are no issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of or other ownership interests in any Subsidiary of
the Company, (ii) warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other obligations of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to issue, any shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of or other ownership interests in or any securities convertible
into, or exchangeable for, any shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of or other ownership interests in any Subsidiary of the Company or
(iii) restricted shares, stock appreciation rights, performance units,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

  

  

contingent value rights, "phantom" stock or similar securities or rights
issued or granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are
derivative of, or provide economic benefits based, directly or indirectly, on
the value or price of, any capital stock or other voting securities of or
other ownership interests in any Subsidiary of the Company (the items in
clauses (i) through (iii) being referred to collectively as the "Company
Subsidiary Securities"). There are no outstanding obligations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of
the Company Subsidiary Securities.

  

  

(c) Section 4.06(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists, as of the date
of this Agreement, each Person other than a Subsidiary of the Company in which
the Company owns, directly or indirectly, any shares of capital stock or other
voting securities or other ownership interests, other than (i) publicly traded
securities held for investment which do not exceed 5% of the outstanding
securities of any Person and (ii) securities held by any employee benefit plan
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any trustee or other fiduciary in
such capacity under any such employee benefit plan (each, a "Company
Investment"). All of the capital stock or other voting securities of or other
ownership interests in each Company Investment that are owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company, are owned by the Company or a Subsidiary of the
Company free and clear of all Liens and any other limitation or restriction
(including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of
such shares of capital stock or other voting securities or other ownership
interests), except Liens under Applicable Law and restrictions on transfer set
forth in the agreements governing any such Company Investment.

  

  

Section 4.07. SEC Filings and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. (a) The Company has
filed with or furnished to the SEC (including following any extensions of time
for filing provided by Rule 12b 25 promulgated under the 1934 Act) all
reports, schedules, forms, statements, prospectuses, registration statements
and other documents required to be filed or furnished by the Company since
January 1, 2011 (collectively, together with any exhibits and schedules
thereto and other information incorporated therein, the "Company SEC
Documents").

  

  

(b) As of its filing date (or as of the date of any amendment filed prior to
the date hereof), each Company SEC Document complied, and each Company SEC
Document filed subsequent to the date hereof will comply, as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the
1934 Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be.

  

  

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing
prior to the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company SEC
Document filed or furnished pursuant to the 1934 Act did not, and each Company
SEC Document filed or furnished subsequent to the date hereof will not,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

  

  

therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading in any material respect.

  

  

(d) Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the 1933 Act, as of the date
such registration statement or amendment became effective, did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading in any material respect.

  

  

(e) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made
known to the Company's principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer by others within those entities, particularly during the periods in
which the periodic reports required under the 1934 Act are being prepared.
Such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably effective in timely
alerting the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer to material information required to be included in the Company's
periodic and current reports required under the 1934 Act. For purposes of this
Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer"
shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  

  

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system
of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under
the 1934 Act) ("internal controls"). Such internal controls are sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company's
financial reporting and the preparation of Company financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has disclosed, based on
its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to
the Company's auditors and audit committee (i) any significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in internal controls. The Company has made available to
Parent prior to the date hereof a summary of any such disclosure made by
management to the Company's auditors and audit committee since January 1,
2011.

  

  

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has extended or maintained
credit, arranged for the extension of credit, or renewed an extension of
credit, in the form of a personal loan to or for any executive officer (as
defined in Rule 3b-7 under the 1934 Act) or director of the Company in
violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) The Company is in compliance, and has complied, in each case in all
material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations
of the NYSE.

  

  

(i) Each of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of
the Company (or each former principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company, as applicable) have made all certifications
required by Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the 1934 Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC and the NYSE, and the statements contained in any such certifications
are complete and correct.

  

  

(j) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent, prior to the date
hereof, copies of the documentation creating or governing all securitization
transactions and other off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Item 303
of Regulation S-K of the SEC) that existed or were effected by the Company or

profit-sharing, equity compensation or other forms of incentive or deferred
compensation, insurance (including any self-insured arrangements), health or
medical benefits, post-employment or retirement benefits (including
compensation, pension, health, medical or life insurance benefits) which is
maintained, administered or contributed to by the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate and covers any current or former employee, director or other
independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with

other than a Multiemployer Plan or a Company International Plan. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof, but in no event more than 60
days after the date hereof, copies of such plans and any material Company
International Plan and Multiemployer Plan (and, if applicable, related trust
or funding agreements or insurance policies) and all amendments thereto and
written interpretations thereof will be furnished to Parent together with the
most recent annual report (Form 5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B
thereto) and tax return (Form 990) prepared in connection with any such plan

Section 3(37) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan") and, to the Company's
knowledge, no circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any such withdrawal (including as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement). Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has received notice of any Multiemployer Plan's (i) failure to
satisfy the minimum funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code or
application for or receipt of a waiver of such minimum funding requirements,
(ii) "endangered status" or "critical status" (within the meaning of Section
432 of the Code) or (iii) insolvency, "reorganization" (within the meaning of
Section 4241 of ERISA) or proposed or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened
termination. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, all contributions,
surcharges and premium payments owed by the Company and its ERISA Affiliates
with respect to each Multiemployer Plan have been paid when due.

including ERISA and the Code, except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(e) Except as disclosed in Section 4.17(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,

or other independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
severance pay or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any
payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of material
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any
other material obligation pursuant to, any Company Plan. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to gross-up, indemnify or

respect of post-retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for
retired, former or current employees, directors or other independent
contractors of the Company or its Subsidiaries except as required to avoid
excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code.

(t) agree, resolve or commit to do any of the foregoing.

  

  

Section 6.02. Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall cause a meeting
of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting") to be duly called and
held as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement (but
in no event later than 40 days after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the 1933 Act) for the purpose of voting on the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger. In connection with the Company
Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall (i) subject to Section 6.03, (1)
recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby by the Company's stockholders and (2) use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval and (ii)
otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to such meeting.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement has
terminated in accordance with its terms, this Agreement and the Merger shall
be submitted to the Company's stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting
whether or not (x) the Company's Board of Directors shall have effected a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (y) any Company Acquisition Proposal
shall have been publicly proposed or announced or otherwise submitted to the
Company or any of its advisors. The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder
Meeting; provided that the Company may, without the prior written consent of
Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting (A) if, as of the
time for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set
forth in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus), there are insufficient shares
of Company Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting,
(B) after consultation with Parent, if the failure to adjourn or postpone the
Company Stockholder Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a violation of

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Applicable Law for the distribution of any required supplement or amendment to
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (C) after consultation with Parent, for
a single period not to exceed ten Business Days, to solicit additional proxies
if necessary to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, or (D) if the Company
has delivered to Parent a bona fide notice contemplated by Section 6.03(c),
for a maximum of ten Business Days. Parent may require the Company to adjourn,
delay or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting once for a period not to
exceed 30 calendar days (but prior to the date that is two Business Days prior
to the End Date) to solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval. Once the Company has established a record date for the
Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting without
the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), unless required to do so by Applicable Law or the Company's
organizational documents. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the
adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Merger) shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and
matters required by Applicable Law to be voted on by the Company's
stockholders in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby) that the Company shall propose to be acted
on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

  

  

Section 6.03. No Solicitation; Other Offers. (a) General Prohibitions. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its or their officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other
agents or advisors ("Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate or encourage the
submission of any Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate
in any discussions (other than to state that the Company is not permitted to
have discussions) or negotiations with any Third Party that is seeking to
make, or has made, a Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) furnish any non-
public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, otherwise knowingly cooperate in any
way with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any
effort by any Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made, a Company
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (v)
fail to enforce or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries unless the Board of Directors of the Company determines
after consulting with its outside legal counsel that the failure to waive such
provision would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law; provided, that the Company shall not enforce and hereby waives any
provision of any such agreement that would prohibit a third party from
communicating confidentially a Company Acquisition Proposal to the Company's
Board of Directors, (vi) approve any transaction under, or any Person becoming
an "interested stockholder" under, Section 203 of Delaware Law or (vii) enter

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument
relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement to the extent contemplated by Section 6.03(b)); provided that (so
long as the Company and its Representatives have otherwise complied with this
Section 6.03) none of the foregoing shall prohibit the Company and its
Representatives from, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Approval,
participating in discussions with any Persons or group of Persons who has made
a Company Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement solely to
request the clarification of the terms and conditions thereof so as to
determine whether the Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and any such actions shall not be a breach of
this Section 6.03(a). It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions on
the Company set forth in this Section by any Representative of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section by the Company.

  

  

(b) Recommendation Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), but subject to
Section 6.03(c) and Section 6.03(d), at any time prior to the Company
Stockholder Approval:

  

  

(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other
intermediaries, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third
Party that, subject to the Company's compliance with Section 6.03(a), has made
after the date of this Agreement a Company Superior Proposal or a Company
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisors, could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal by the Third
Party making such Company Acquisition Proposal, (B) furnish to such Third
Party and its advisors, agents or other intermediaries (including financing
sources) non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (a copy of
which shall be provided for informational purposes only to Parent) with such
Third Party with terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained
in the confidentiality agreement, dated February 8, 2014, between the Company
and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement") (it being understood and hereby
agreed that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a "standstill" or
similar provision that prohibits such Third Party from making any Company
Acquisition Proposal, acquiring the Company or taking any other action);
provided that all such information (to the extent that such information has
not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made
available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or as promptly as
practicable (but no later than 24 hours) after the time it is provided or made
available to such Third Party) and (C) take any

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

action required by Applicable Law or that any court of competent jurisdiction
orders the Company to take;

  

  

(ii) following receipt of a Company Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors
of the Company may, subject to compliance with Section 6.03(c), make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change; and

  

  

(iii) following a Company Intervening Event, the Board of Directors of the
Company may, subject to compliance with Section 6.03(d), make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to such Company
Intervening Event;

  

  

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) only if
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
considering advice from outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.
For purposes of clarification, the taking of any of the actions permitted by
Section 6.03(a) and Section 6.03(b)(i) shall not be deemed to be a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change.

  

  

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company or its Board
of Directors from (i) complying with Rule 14a-9, Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the 1934 Act (or making any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with any amendment to the terms of
a tender offer or exchange offer) so long as any action taken or statement
made to so comply is consistent with this Section 6.03 or (ii) disclosing
factual information regarding the business, financial condition or results of
operations of Parent or the Company or the fact that a Company Acquisition
Proposal has been made, the identity of the party making such proposal or the
material terms of such proposal in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
otherwise, to the extent the Company in good faith determines that such
information, facts, identity or terms is required to be disclosed under
Applicable Law or that failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided that any such action
taken or statement or disclosure made that relates to a Company Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless
the Board of Directors of the Company reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation in such statement or disclosure or in connection with such
action (except that a mere "stop, look and listen" disclosure in compliance
with Rule 14d-9(f) of the 1934 Act or failure to take a position with respect
to a Company Acquisition Proposal governed by the tender offer or exchange
offer rules under the 1934 Act until the tenth Business Day after commencement
of such Company Acquisition Proposal shall not constitute a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change).

  

  

(c) Required Notices. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any
of the actions referred to in Section 6.03(b) unless the Company

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it
intends to take such action, and, after taking such action, the Company shall,
if such action is in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal, continue
to advise Parent on a current basis of the status and terms of any discussions
and negotiations with the Third Party. In addition, the Company shall notify
Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the
Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Company Acquisition Proposal,
any written indication from a Third Party that such Third Party is considering
making a Company Acquisition Proposal or any written request for information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Third Party that has indicated that it is considering
making, or has made, a Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall within
24 hours of receipt thereof provide such notice orally and in writing and
shall identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and conditions
of, any such Company Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, and shall
promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent
copies of all material correspondence and written materials sent or provided
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that describes any terms or
conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and details
of any such Company Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. Any material
amendment to any Company Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Company Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the Company's compliance with
this Section 6.03(c).

  

  

(d) "Last Look". The Board of Directors of the Company shall not make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Company Acquisition
Proposal unless (i) such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing at
least five Business Days before taking that action, of its intention to do so,
attaching the most current version of the proposed agreement under which such
Company Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of
the Third Party making the Company Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) Parent does
not make, within such five-Business-Day period after its receipt of that
written notification, an offer that is at least as favorable to the
stockholders of the Company as such Company Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms of such Company Superior Proposal shall require a new written
notification from the Company and a new period under clause (ii) of this
Section 6.03(d), except that such period shall be three Business Days instead
of five Business Days). The Board of Directors of the Company shall not make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Company Intervening
Event, unless (A) the Company has provided Parent with written information
describing such Company Intervening Event in reasonable detail promptly after
becoming aware of it and keeps Parent fully informed, on a reasonably current
basis, of material developments with respect to such Company Intervening
Event, (B) the Company has provided Parent at least five Business

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Days prior notice of its intention to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change with respect to such Company Intervening Event, attaching a reasonably
detailed explanation of the facts underlying the determination by the Board of
Directors of the Company that a Company Intervening Event has occurred and its
need to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in light of the Company
Intervening Event and (C) Parent does not make, within such five-Business-Day
period, an offer that the Company's Board of Directors determines would
obviate the need for a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in light of the
Company Intervening Event. During any five-Business-Day period prior to
effecting a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section
6.03(d), the Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith
with Parent and its Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent.

  

  

(e) Definition of Company Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Company Superior Proposal" means a bona fide, unsolicited written Company
Acquisition Proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Stock or all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel and taking into
account all material financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal, including the terms and conditions of the Company Acquisition
Proposal, (x) is on terms and conditions more favorable to the Company's
stockholders than the transactions contemplated hereby (taking into account
any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 6.03(d)) and (y) is reasonably likely to be consummated and, if a cash
transaction (whether in whole or in part), has financing, if any, that is then
fully committed or reasonably determined to be available by the Board of
Directors of the Company.

  

  

(f) Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately
and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its Representatives and its
financing sources conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly request that each
Third Party, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement within the
24-month period prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration
of any Company Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and other materials prepared by
or on behalf of such Person that contains, reflects or analyzes that
information), and the Company shall provide to Parent all certifications of
such return or destruction from such other Persons as promptly as practicable
after receipt thereof. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to secure all such certifications as promptly as practicable. If any
such Person fails to provide any required certification within the time period
allotted in the relevant confidentiality

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

agreement (or if no such period is specified, then within a reasonable time
period after the date hereof), then the Company shall take all actions that
may be reasonably necessary to secure its rights and ensure the performance of
such other party's obligations thereunder as promptly as practicable.

  

  

Section 6.04. Tax Matters. (a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time,
except as consented to in writing by Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall make or change any material Tax election, change any
annual tax accounting period, adopt or change any method of tax accounting,
file any material amended Tax Returns or claims for material Tax refunds,
enter into any material closing agreement, surrender any material Tax claim,
audit or assessment, surrender any right to claim a material Tax refund,
offset or other reduction in Tax liability, consent to any extension or waiver
of the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment or take or
omit to take any other action with respect to Taxes, in each case, if any such
action or omission would have the effect of materially increasing the Tax
liability or accrual of Tax liability under FASB Interpretation No. 48 or
materially reducing any Tax asset or accrual of Tax asset under FASB
Interpretation No. 48 of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall establish or cause to be
established in accordance with GAAP on or before the Effective Time an
adequate accrual for all Taxes due with respect to any period or portion
thereof ending prior to or as of the Effective Time.

  

  

(c) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger
(including any real property transfer tax and any similar Tax) shall be paid
by the Company (or the applicable Subsidiary) when due, and the Company (or
the applicable Subsidiary) shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax
returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes and fees, and,
if required by Applicable Law, the Company (or the applicable Subsidiary)
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such
Tax returns and other documentation.

  

  

Section 6.05. Voting of Shares. The Company shall vote all shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than, for the avoidance of doubt, any such shares held by any employee
benefit plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any trustee or other
fiduciary in such capacity under any employee benefit plan) in favor of the
Parent Stock Issuance at the Parent Shareholder Meeting.

ARTICLE 7

  

Covenants of Parent

  

  

Parent agrees that:

  

  

Section 7.01. Conduct of Parent. From the date hereof until the Effective Time
except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, as set forth in Section
7.01 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as consented to in writing by the
Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
or as required by Applicable Law, Parent shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to conduct its business in all material respects in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to preserve intact its business organizations and relationships with
Third Parties. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the date
hereof until the Effective Time, except as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, as set forth in Section 7.01 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as
consented to in writing by the Company or as required by Applicable Law, from
the date hereof until the Effective Time Parent shall not, nor shall it permit
any of its Subsidiaries to:

  

  

(a) amend the articles of incorporation or bylaws of Parent in a manner that
would have a material and adverse impact on the value of Parent Class A Common
Stock;

  

  

(b) without limiting the Company's obligations under Section 8.01 (including
the last sentence of Section 8.01(a)), split, combine or reclassify any shares
of capital stock of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or declare, set aside or
pay any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property or
any combination thereof) in respect of the capital stock of Parent or its
Subsidiaries, or redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire or offer to redeem,
repurchase, or otherwise acquire any Parent Securities, except for (i)
dividends by any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, (ii) regular quarterly cash
dividends by Parent with customary record and payment dates on shares of
Parent Stock not in excess of $0.225 per share per quarter, as such amount may
be increased for 2015 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice; and (iii) repurchases of shares of Parent Stock at then prevailing
market prices pursuant to Parent's share repurchase program as in effect from
time to time;

  

  

(c) adopt or publicly propose a plan of complete or partial liquidation or
resolutions providing for or authorizing such a liquidation or a dissolution,
restructuring, recapitalization or reorganization;

  

  

(d) knowingly and intentionally take any action that would reasonably be
expected to make any representation or warranty of Parent hereunder inaccurate
in any material respect at, or immediately prior to, the Effective Time; or

  

  

(e) agree, resolve or commit to do any of the foregoing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 7.02. Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.03. Parent Shareholder Meeting. Parent shall cause a meeting of its
shareholders (the "Parent Shareholder Meeting") to be duly called and held as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in no
event later than 40 days after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the 1993 Act) for the purpose of voting on the approval of the
issuance of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock as part of the Merger
Consideration (the "Parent Stock Issuance"). In connection with the Parent
Shareholder Meeting, the Board of Directors of Parent shall (i) (1) recommend
approval of the Parent Stock Issuance to Parent's shareholders and (2) use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval and (ii)
otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to such meeting.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement has
terminated in accordance with its terms, the Parent Stock Issuance shall be
submitted to the Parent's shareholders at the Parent Shareholder Meeting.
Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, adjourn or
postpone the Parent Shareholder Meeting; provided that Parent may, without the
prior written consent of the Company adjourn or postpone the Parent
Shareholder Meeting (A) if, as of the time for which the Parent Shareholder
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus), there are insufficient shares of Parent Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Parent Shareholder Meeting, (B) after consultation
with the Company, if the failure to adjourn or postpone the Parent Shareholder
Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a violation of Applicable Law for
the distribution of any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or (C) after consultation with the Company, for a single
period not to exceed ten Business Days, to solicit additional proxies if
necessary to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval. The Company may require
Parent to adjourn, delay or postpone the Parent Shareholder Meeting once for a
period not to exceed 30 calendar days (but prior to the date that is two
Business Days prior to the End Date) to solicit additional proxies necessary
to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval. Once Parent has established a
record date for the Company Shareholder Meeting, Parent shall not change such
record date or establish a different record date for the Parent Shareholder
Meeting without the prior written consent of the Company (not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), unless required to do so by
Applicable Law or Parent's organizational documents. Without the prior written
consent of the Company, the approval of the Parent Stock Issuance shall be the
only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by
Applicable Law to be voted on by Parent's stockholders in connection with the
approval of the Parent Stock Issuance) that Parent shall propose to be acted
on by the shareholders of Parent at the Parent Shareholder Meeting.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 7.04. Certain Prohibitions. From the date hereof until May 23, 2014,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any agreements
(written or oral) providing for the divestiture of in excess of 25,000
subscribers in the aggregate.

  

  

Section 7.05. Approval by Sole Stockholder of Merger Subsidiary. Immediately
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties hereto,
Parent, as sole stockholder of Merger Subsidiary, shall adopt this Agreement
and approve the Merger, in accordance with Delaware Law, by written consent.

  

  

Section 7.06. Voting of Shares. Parent shall vote all shares of Company Stock
beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, any such shares held by any employee benefit plan of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any trustee or other fiduciary in such
capacity under any employee benefit plan) in favor of adoption of this
Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

  

  

Section 7.07. Director and Officer Indemnification. (a) From and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless and provide advancement
of expenses to, the present (as of the date hereof or any time prior to the
Effective Time) and former officers and directors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any individual who is as of the date of this Agreement or
commences, prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company as a director or officer of another Person
(each, an "Indemnified Person") in respect of (i) acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, (ii) the fact that such Indemnified Person
is or was a director or officer, or is or was serving at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person
prior to the Effective Time and (iii) this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware
Law or any other Applicable Law or provided under the Company's or its
Subsidiaries' certificate of incorporation and bylaws or comparable
organizational documents in effect on the date hereof; provided that such
indemnification and advancement of expenses shall be subject to any limitation
imposed from time to time under Applicable Law; provided, further, that any
Person to whom expenses are advanced shall provide an undertaking to repay
such advances to the extent required by Applicable Law. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the
payment and performance obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 7.07(a).

  

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in
effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation's and each Subsidiary of the
Company's certificates of incorporation and bylaws and comparable
organizational documents (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement in the Company's and the or such Subsidiary of the Company's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws and comparable organization documents,
as applicable.

  

  

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving
Corporation hereby agrees, to either (i) continue to maintain in effect for
six years after the Effective Time the Company's directors' and officers'
insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively,
"DandO Insurance") in place as of the date hereof or (ii) purchase comparable
DandO Insurance for such six-year period, in each case with respect to any claim
related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time with coverage
not less than the existing coverage and other terms, conditions, retentions
and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as those contained in
the DandO Insurance in effect as of the date hereof; provided that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such
policies pursuant to this sentence an aggregate premium amount in excess of
300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year,
which amount is set forth in Section 7.07(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule; and provided, further, that if the aggregate premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount. At the Company's option, the Company may purchase,
prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" with coverage
not less than the existing coverage and other terms, conditions, retentions
and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as those contained in
the DandO Insurance in effect as of the date hereof, in which event Parent shall
cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this Section
7.07(c); provided that the aggregate premium for such policies shall not
exceed 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal
year. In the event the Company elects to purchase such a "tail policy," the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) maintain such "tail policy" in full force and effect and continue to honor
their respective obligations thereunder.

  

  

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall assume the applicable obligations of such party set forth in
this Section 7.07.

  

  

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.07 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

  

  

Section 7.08. Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to be issued as
part of the Merger Consideration to be listed on NASDAQ, subject to official
notice of issuance.

  

  

Section 7.09. Employee Matters. (a) During the period beginning at the
Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time (the
"Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided,
to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to be
employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) immediately following the
Effective Time (each, a "Continuing Employee"), other than any Continuing
Employee included in a collective bargaining unit covered by the Collective
Bargaining Agreements as in effect on the Closing Date (each, a "Union
Employee"), with, to the extent employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries, (i)
base pay, commission opportunities and cash bonus opportunities, as
applicable, that are no less favorable in the aggregate than provided to each
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii)
employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than provided to
each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided,
that, for purposes of determining whether such pay, opportunities and benefits
are no less favorable in the aggregate, equity compensation, defined benefit
pension plan benefits, severance, retention (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any supplemental cash bonus opportunity set forth on Section 6.01(m) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule), sale, stay, or change in control payments or
awards or any similar compensation or benefit, shall not be taken into
account. With respect to Union Employee, Parent shall retain, or shall cause
to be retained, any and all of the rights and obligations it may have pursuant
to Applicable Law.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 7.09(a), beginning on the Closing Date, Parent
shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, for the benefit of each
Continuing Employee, other than any Union Employee, (i) honor all contracts
providing for severance to the extent and in accordance with their terms and
(ii) honor, without amendment, all plans providing for severance for the
Continuation Period or for any longer period during which such amendments are
prohibited under the terms of the applicable plan, in all cases, as long as
such contract or plan is set forth on Section 7.09(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. It is intended that Section 7.09(a) and this Section
7.09(b) shall not result in any duplication of benefits to any Continuing
Employee.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) To the extent that Continuing Employees, other than Union Employees,
become eligible to participate in any "employee benefit plan," as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Parent Plans"), then, for purposes of determining (i)
eligibility to participate and vesting and, (ii) solely with respect to any
Parent Plan that provides for severance, vacation or paid-time off benefits,
for purposes of benefit accrual, service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service with
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent recognized by the Company and
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits and the Parent shall not be required to
provide credit for such service for eligibility, vesting or benefit accrual
purposes under any Parent Plan that is an equity compensation plan, defined
benefit pension plan or postretirement medical plan. In addition, subject to
the terms of the applicable Parent Plan and Legal Requirements, Parent shall
use reasonable best efforts to (x) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to Continuing Employees under any Parent Plan
that is a welfare benefit plan in which such Continuing Employees may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time and (y) provide each
Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Parent Plans
that are welfare plans in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to
participate after the Effective Time.

  

  

(d) For the avoidance of doubt and to the extent required by any Company Plan
or Applicable Law, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to,
expressly assume such Company Plan and all obligations thereunder.

  

  

(e) Upon the request of Parent prior to the Effective Time but after the date
the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or,
to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have
been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties
entitled to the benefits of such conditions, effective as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate or shall cause the
termination of any or all U.S. tax-qualified defined contribution plans
provided to current and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
as directed by the Parent and in compliance with Applicable Law.

  

  

(f) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.06, nothing contained in
this Section 7.09, expressed or implied, shall (i) be treated as the
establishment, amendment or modification of any Company Plan or Parent Plan
or, subject to compliance with the requirements of Section 7.09(a) and
7.09(b), constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify, merge or
terminate after the Effective Time any Company Plan or Parent Plan, (ii) give
any current or former

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

  

employee, director or other independent contractor of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof), any third-party
beneficiary or other rights or (iii) obligate Parent or any of its Affiliates
to (A) maintain any particular Company Plan or Parent Plan or (B) retain the
employment or services of any current or former employee, director or other
independent contractor.

  

  

ARTICLE 8

  

Covenants of Parent and the Company

  

  

The parties hereto agree that:

  

  

Section 8.01. Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, and assist and cooperate with the other in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with

and (ii) obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations,
permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from
any Governmental Authority or other Third Party that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether or not such approvals,
consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations are
conditions to the consummation of the Merger pursuant to Article 9).

  

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall make, and not withdraw, as promptly as practicable and in
any event within 30 Business Days (or, in the case of the succeeding clauses
(iii) and (iv), 60 days) of the date hereof, (i) an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) all necessary filings to obtain
consents from the FCC (including FCC Forms 394 or other appropriate forms)
that are required in connection with the Merger, (iii) all necessary filings
to obtain consents from the state regulators and the Franchise authorities
that are required in connection with the Merger and (iv) all other
registrations, declarations, notices and filings with Governmental Authorities
that are required in connection with the Merger. Each of the Company and
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the foregoing, and use its reasonable best efforts to
take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods regarding the foregoing as soon as practicable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Parent shall take the lead in (i) the scheduling of, and strategic
planning for, any meeting with any Governmental Authority under the HSR Act or
any other applicable Competition Law, (ii) the making of any filings,
including the initial filings under the HSR Act, (iii) the process for the
receipt of any necessary approvals and (iv) the resolution of any
investigation or other inquiry of any such Governmental Authority. Without
limiting the foregoing sentence, except as prohibited by Applicable Law, each
of Parent and the Company shall, (A) to the extent reasonably practicable,
consult with each other prior to taking any material substantive position with
respect to the filings under the HSR Act or any other Competition Law in
discussions with or filings to be submitted to any Governmental Authority, (B)
to the extent reasonably practicable, permit the other to review and discuss
in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection
with, any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals to be submitted to any Governmental Authority with respect to
filings under the HSR Act or any other Competition Law, and (C) to the extent
reasonably practicable, coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging
such information and promptly provide the other (and its counsel) with copies
of all filings, presentations or submissions (and a summary of any oral
presentations) made by such party with any Governmental Authority relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or
any other Competition Law.

  

  

(d) Unless prohibited by Applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Authority, each of the Company and Parent shall (i) to the extent reasonably
practicable, not participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in any
substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of the
Merger (including with respect to any of the actions referred to in Section
8.01(a)) without the other (provided that, subject to Section 8.01(c), either
party may participate in or attend any such non-substantive meeting), (ii) to
the extent reasonably practicable, give the other reasonable prior notice of
any such meeting or conversation and (iii) in the event one party is
prohibited by Applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Authority from
participating or attending any such meeting or engaging in any such
conversation, keep such party reasonably apprised with respect thereto;
provided that, Parent or its representatives may conduct such a meeting or
conversation without the Company or its representatives present upon the prior
written consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereto understand and agree that "reasonable best efforts" shall not require
Parent to (i) divest or otherwise hold separate (including by establishing a
trust or otherwise) any businesses, assets or properties of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or any businesses, assets or properties of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (ii) accept any conditions or take any other actions that
would apply to, or affect, any businesses, assets or properties of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or any businesses, assets or properties of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) litigate or participate in the litigation
of any proceeding

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  

  

involving the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission or Department of Justice,
whether judicial or administrative, in order to (A) oppose or defend against
any action by any such Governmental Authority to prevent or enjoin the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (B) overturn any regulatory action by any such Governmental
Authority to prevent consummation of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by defending any suit,
action or other legal proceeding brought by any such Governmental Authority in
order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, overturned or terminated or
appealing any order, except, in the case of this clause (iii), to the extent
Parent determines in its reasonable good faith judgment that there is a
reasonable prospect of success in relation to such litigation and that the
participation by Parent in such litigation would not pose a material risk of
the imposition of a Burdensome Condition; provided, however, that, (x)
notwithstanding the preceding clause (i), Parent is prepared to divest up to
approximately 3 million subscribers of the combined company and (y) Parent and
its Subsidiaries shall be required, notwithstanding the preceding clause (ii),
(A) to take the actions and accept the conditions described in the immediately
preceding clause (ii) to the extent such actions are consistent in scope and
magnitude with the conditions and actions (other than any condition that was
subsequently suspended by the agency that imposed the condition) required or
imposed by Governmental Authorities in connection with prior acquisitions of
United States domestic Cable Systems consummated within the past twelve years
with an aggregate purchase price of at least $500 million and (B) to implement
the undertakings set forth on Section 8.01 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule
(other than any undertaking to divest subscribers, the "Undertakings"), with
such modifications to the Undertakings that, taken in the aggregate, are no
more adverse to the businesses, assets and properties of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the businesses, assets and properties of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (each condition and action
described in clause (i) or (ii) that Parent is not required to accept or take
after giving effect to the proviso to this Section 8.01(e), a "Burdensome
Condition"). In that regard, the Company agrees to work in good faith in
connection with Parent's efforts to structure any divestitures (whether by
sale, spin off or otherwise) in a manner that Parent believes in good faith is
in the best interests of the combined company and its shareholders. In
addition, the Company shall not accept any of the conditions or take any of
the foregoing actions (whether or not consistent in scope and magnitude with
such prior conditions and actions) without Parent's prior written consent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall be required to commit to or
effect any action contemplated by this Section 8.01(e) that is not conditioned
upon the consummation of the Merger.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not
accept, agree to or accede to any modifications or amendments to, or in
connection with, or any conditions to the transfer of, any Franchises that are
not approved by Parent in writing; provided, however, that if the Company
affords Parent reasonable notice of, and opportunity to attend and participate
in, meetings or other discussions relating to Franchise approvals where

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  

  

modifications, amendments or conditions are expected to be discussed or
negotiated, Parent shall approve any such modifications, amendments or
conditions that are approved by the Company so long as such modifications,
amendments or conditions are commercially reasonable and are similar in
nature, extent and impact (giving due consideration to such factors as the
relative size of the Franchise involved, the proximity of other Franchises,
the financial and operational impact of the change and the precedential impact
thereof) to modifications, amendments or conditions agreed to by Parent in
connection with material acquisitions of cable assets effected since 2001. In
addition, if Parent seeks any Franchise approval pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall agree to any modifications,
amendments or conditions that are commercially reasonable and are similar in
nature, extent and impact (giving due consideration to such factors as the
relative size of the Franchise involved, the proximity of other Franchises,
the financial and operational impact of the change and the precedential impact
thereof) to modifications, amendments or conditions agreed to by Parent in
connection with material acquisitions of cable assets effected since 2001.

  

  

(g) Each of Parent and the Company shall not, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to, (i) take any action that would reasonably
be expected to have the effect of materially delaying, impairing or impeding
the receipt of any regulatory approvals required in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or the Closing, or (ii) acquire (by merger
consolidation, acquisition of stock or assets or otherwise), directly or
indirectly, any assets, securities (other than securities issued by such party
as permitted by Section 6.01 or Section 7.01, as the case may be), properties,
interests or business in any transaction or series of related transactions, if
such acquisition would (A) require approval of the FCC, or (B) (without the
consent of the other, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed
by the Company) have a value, or involve the payment of consideration, in
excess of $1 billion; provided, however, that the foregoing sentence shall not
prohibit Parent, the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates from taking any action set forth on Section 8.01(g) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

(h) Each of the Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this Section 8.01 as "Outside Counsel Only Material." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside counsel of the recipient and, subject to any additional
confidentiality or joint defense agreement the parties may mutually propose
and enter into, will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (the Company or Parent, as the
case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 8.01, materials provided to the other party or its outside
counsel may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning valuation, (ii) as
necessary to comply with

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

  

  

contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable
attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns.

  

  

Section 8.02. Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statement. (a) As
promptly as practicable, the Company and Parent shall prepare and file the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement (in which the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included) with the SEC. The Company
and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration
Statement to become effective under the 1933 Act as soon after such filing as
practicable and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is
necessary to consummate the Merger. Subject to Section 6.03, the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall include the recommendation of the Board of
Directors of the Company in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement
and the Merger and the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Parent in
favor of approval of the Parent Stock Issuance. The Company and Parent shall
cooperate with one another in (x) setting a mutually acceptable date for the
Company Stockholder Meeting and the Parent Shareholder Meeting, so as to
enable them to occur, to the extent practicable, on the same date and (y)
setting the dates for their respective annual meetings of stockholders. The
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its respective stockholders or
shareholders, as the case may be, as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement becomes effective. Each of the Company and Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Registration Statement and
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus comply as to form in all material
respects with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the 1933
Act and the 1934 Act, respectively.

  

  

(b) The Company and Parent shall make all necessary filings with respect to
the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby under the 1933 Act and the
1934 Act and applicable state "blue sky" laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

  

  

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly provide the other parties
and their respective counsel with (i) any comments or other communications,
whether written or oral, that such party or its counsel may receive from time
to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, as applicable, promptly
after receipt of those comments or other communications and (ii) a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the response to those comments.

  

  

(d) No amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement will be made by Parent or the Company without the
approval of the other parties hereto, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; provided that the Company, in connection with a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change made in compliance with the terms hereof may
amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including by
incorporation by reference) pursuant to an

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

 

  

  

amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the
extent it contains (i) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) a
statement of the reason of the Company's Board of Directors for making such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and (iii) additional information
reasonably related to the foregoing. Each party will advise the other parties,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration
Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed,
the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of Parent
Class A Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement. If, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Company discovers any information
relating to any party, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, so that none of
those documents would include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements in any such document,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party that discovers that information shall promptly notify the other party
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing that information shall
be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law or
regulation, disseminated to the shareholders and stockholders, respectively,
of Parent and the Company.

  

  

Section 8.03. Public Announcements. (a) Except with respect to any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with this Agreement, or
Parent's response thereto, or any communication made in accordance with
Section 6.03, the Company and Parent shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release, making any other public statement or scheduling any
press conference or conference call with investors or analysts with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, except
for any public statement or press release as may be required by Applicable
Law, order of a court of competent jurisdiction or any listing agreement with
or rule of any national securities exchange or association, shall not issue
any such press release, make any such other public statement or schedule any
such press conference or conference call before that consultation and
providing each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any such press
release or public statement; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
apply to any press release or other public statement to the extent it contains
substantially the same information as previously communicated by one or more
of the parties. The initial press release of the parties announcing the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release of Parent and the
Company in a form that is mutually agreed.

  

  

(b) Except with respect to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change made in
accordance with this Agreement, or Parent's response thereto, or any
communication made in accordance with Section 6.03, before any Merger
Communication of the Company, Parent or any of their

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

73  

  

 

 

 

  

  

respective "participants" (as defined in Rule 165 of the 1933 Act or Item 4 of
Schedule 14A of the 1934 Act) is (i) disseminated to any investor, analyst,
member of the media, employee, client, customer or other third-party or
otherwise made accessible on the website of the Company, Parent or any such
participant, as applicable (whether in written, video or oral form via
webcast, hyperlink or otherwise), or (ii) utilized by any officer, senior
manager, key employee or advisor of the Company, Parent or any such
participant, as applicable, as a script in discussions or meetings with any
such third parties, then, in each case, the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, shall (or shall cause any such participant to) cooperate in good faith
with respect to any such Merger Communication for purposes of, among other
things, determining whether that communication (x) is required to be filed
under Rules 165 and 425 of the 1934 Act or (y) constitutes "soliciting
material" that is required to be filed by Rule 14a-6(b) or Rule 14a-12(b) of
the 1934 Act, as applicable, by the Company, Merger Subsidiary or Parent, as
applicable, and shall (or shall cause any such participant to) give reasonable
and good faith consideration to any comments made by the other such party or
parties and their counsel on any such Merger Communication; provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not apply to any Merger Communication that contains
substantially the same information as has previously been communicated by such
Person. For purposes of the foregoing, the term "Merger Communication" shall
mean, with respect to any Person, any document or other written communication
prepared by or on behalf of that Person, or any document or other material or
information posted or made accessible on the website of that Person (whether
in written, video or oral form via webcast, hyperlink or otherwise), that is
related to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, if
reviewed by a relevant stockholder, could reasonably be deemed to constitute
either (x) an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy Parent Class
A Common Stock or (y) a "solicitation" of "proxies" (in each case, as defined
in Rule 14a-1 of the 1934 Act) in favor of the Merger or the Parent Stock
Issuance.

  

  

Section 8.04. Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take
and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger.

  

  

Section 8.05. Notices of Certain Events. Each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify and provide copies to the other of:

  

  

(a) any written notice from any Person alleging that the approval or consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) any written notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

  

  

(c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to
its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent and any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to any of
such party's representations or warranties, as the case may be, or that are
material and relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement;

  

  

provided that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 8.05 shall
not affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by any
party hereunder or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder
to the party receiving such notice.

  

  

Section 8.06. Access to Information. From the date hereof until the Effective
Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall (i) upon reasonable advance notice, give to the other
party, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives reasonable access during regular business hours to the
offices, properties, books and records of such party (except that neither
party shall conduct any environmental sampling or analysis without the advance
written consent of the other party, which may be withheld in such other
party's sole discretion, and without executing a customary access and
indemnity agreement in respect thereto), (ii) furnish to the other party, its
counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives
such financial and operating data and other information as such Persons may
reasonably request and (iii) instruct its employees, counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives to cooperate with the
other party in its investigation; provided, however, that the each party may
restrict the foregoing access and the disclosure of information pursuant to
this Section 8.06 to the extent that (A) in the reasonable good faith judgment
of such party, any Applicable Law requires such party or its Subsidiaries to
restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information, (B) in the
reasonable good faith judgment of such party, the information is subject to
confidentiality obligations to a Third Party or (C) disclosure of any such
information or document would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege;
provided, further, that with respect to clauses (A) through (C) of this
Section 8.06, Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (1) obtain the required consent of any such Third Party
to provide such access or disclosure, (2) develop an alternative to providing
such information so as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable
to Parent and the Company and (3) in the case of clauses (A) and (C), enter
into a joint defense agreement or implement such other techniques if the
parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such
information without violating Applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

75  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Any investigation pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in such manner
as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the other
party. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to
this Section shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by any party hereunder.

  

  

Section 8.07. Tax-free Reorganization. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, each
of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Merger to qualify as a reorganization as defined in Section 368(a) of the
Code, and shall not take any action reasonably likely to cause the Merger not
so to qualify. Provided the opinion conditions contained in Sections 9.02(b)
and 9.03(b) of this Agreement have been satisfied, each of Parent and the
Company shall report the Merger for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

  

(b) Officers of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company shall execute and
deliver to Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, tax counsel for Parent, and Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, tax counsel for the Company, Tax
Representation Letters. Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any
action that would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause to take any
action which would cause to be untrue) any of the Tax Representation Letters.

  

  

Section 8.08. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, each party
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Company Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Stock)
or acquisitions of Parent Class A Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Parent Class A Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by Article 2 of this Agreement by each individual
who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act
with respect to the Company or will become subject to such reporting
requirements with respect to Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the 1934 Act.

  

  

Section 8.09. Stock Exchange De-listing; 1934 Act Deregistration. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
Applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the de-listing by
the Surviving Corporation of the Company Stock from the NYSE and the
deregistration of the Company Stock and other securities of the Company under
the 1934 Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any
event no more than ten days after the Closing Date.

  

  

Section 8.10. Dividends. After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends
in respect of Parent Class A Common Stock and the Company Stock in order that
holders of Parent Class A Common Stock and the Company Stock shall not

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

  

  

receive two dividends or fail to receive one dividend, for any quarter with
respect to shares of Company Stock, on the one hand, and the Parent Class A
Common Stock issuable in respect of those shares pursuant to the Merger, on
the other.

  

  

Section 8.11. Stockholder Litigation. Each party hereto shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto in writing of any litigation related to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that is brought, or, to the knowledge of the Company or Parent (as
applicable), threatened in writing, against the Company or Parent and/or the
members of the Board of Directors of the Company or the Board of Directors of
Parent, as applicable (any such litigation relating to the Company and/or the
executive officers or members of the Board of Directors of the Company, a
"Company Transaction Litigation", and any such litigation relating to Parent
and/or the executive officers or members of the Board of Directors of Parent,
a "Parent Transaction Litigation") prior to the Effective Time and shall keep
such other party reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The
Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any Company Transaction Litigation, and, except to the extent
required by applicable Law, the Company shall not settle, agree to any
undertakings or approve or otherwise agree to any waiver that may be sought in
connection with such Company Transaction Litigation, without the prior written
consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Without limiting in any way the parties' obligations under Section
8.01, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate, shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, to cooperate, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to cooperate, in the
defense against any litigation contemplated by this Section 8.11.

Termination

  

  

Section 10.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding any
approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company):

  

  

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

  

  

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if:

  

  

(i) if the Merger is not consummated on or before February 12, 2015 (the "End
Date"); provided, however, that, if on such date any of the conditions set
forth in Section 9.01(b), Section 9.01(c) and Section 9.01(d) (solely on
account of a temporary or preliminary order or injunction) are not satisfied,
but all other conditions set forth in Article 9 shall have been satisfied
(other than those conditions that have been waived by the Company and Parent,
if and to the extent that such waiver is permitted by Applicable Law, and
other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at or
immediately prior to the Closing), then either the Company or Parent shall
have the right, in its sole discretion, to extend the End Date by a period of
six months, in which case the End Date shall be August 12, 2015; provided,
further, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
10.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision
of this Agreement results in the failure of the Merger to be consummated on or
before the End Date (as extended, if applicable);

  

  

(ii) there shall be any Applicable Law in effect that (A) makes consummation
of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or (B) permanently enjoins the
Company or Parent from consummating the Merger and, in the case of clauses (A)
and (B) any such Applicable Law, including an injunction, shall have become
final and nonappealable; provided that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 10.01(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party
whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results in such Applicable Law
being in effect; or

  

  

(iii) (A) at the Parent Shareholder Meeting (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof), the Parent Shareholder Approval shall not have been
obtained, or (B) at the Company Stockholder Meeting (including any adjournment
or postponement thereof), the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been
obtained.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

81  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) by Parent, if:

  

  

(i) (A) the Company's Board of Directors shall have made a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (B) the Company's Board of Directors shall have
failed to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation as promptly as practicable
(but in any event within ten Business Days) after receipt of any written
request to do so from Parent following the public announcement of any Company
Acquisition Proposal (provided that Parent shall only make such request once
with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal or any material amendment
thereto); provided that Parent shall no longer be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuance to this Section 10.01(c)(i) at any time after the Company
Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained;

  

  

(ii) there shall be any Applicable Law in effect, including an injunction,
which shall have become final and nonappealable, of any Governmental Authority
of competent jurisdiction in a jurisdiction in which any of the Company,
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries has substantial operations that
imposes any Burdensome Condition;

  

  

(iii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth in Section
9.02(a) not to be satisfied, and such breach is not cured within 30 days'
notice thereof or is incapable of being cured within such time period, but
only so long as neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary are then in breach of
their respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach would cause the condition set forth
in Section 9.03(a) not to be satisfied; or

  

  

(iv) prior to the Company Stockholder Approval having been obtained, an
intentional and material breach of (A) Section 6.03 that is authorized or
permitted by the Company that results in a Third Party making a Company
Acquisition Proposal that is reasonably likely to materially interfere with or
delay consummation of the Merger or (B) the first sentence of Section 6.02
(taking into account the right of the Company to postpone the Company
Stockholder Meeting in accordance with Section 6.02) shall have occurred.

  

  

(d) by the Company, if:

  

  

(i) an intentional and material breach of the first sentence of Section 7.03
shall have occurred (taking into account

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

82  

  

 

 

 

  

  

the right of Parent to postpone the Parent Shareholder Meeting in accordance
with Section 7.03);

  

  

(ii) a material breach of the Voting Agreement shall have occurred that is
noncurable or, if curable, is not cured within 30 days' notice thereof; or

  

  

(iii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Parent or Merger Subsidiary set forth
in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth
in Section 9.03(a) not to be satisfied, and such breach is not cured within 30
days' notice thereof of is incapable of being cured within such time period,
but only so long as the Company is not then in breach of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach
would cause the condition set forth in Section 9.02(a) not to be satisfied.

  

  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01
(other than pursuant to Section 10.01(a)) shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party specifying the provision of this Agreement
pursuant to which such termination is effected.

  

  

Section 10.02. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 10.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect without
liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee,
agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other party hereto;
provided that, if such termination shall result from the (i) intentional and
willful failure of any party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the
obligations of any other party hereunder, (ii) failure of any party to perform
a covenant hereof or (iii) willful and material breach by any Party of any
representation or warranty herein, such party shall be fully liable for any
and all liabilities and damages incurred or suffered by any other party as a
result of such failure, which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be
limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include
to the extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost by a party's stockholders
(taking into consideration relevant matters, including other combination
opportunities and the time value of money), which shall be deemed in such
event to be damages of such party. The provisions of this Section 10.02 and
Article 11 shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 10.01.

and warranties contained herein and in any certificate or other writing
delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time. This

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

84  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 11.02 shall not limit Section 10.02 or any covenant or agreement of
the parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective
Time.

  

  

Section 11.03. Amendments and Waivers. (a) Any provision of this Agreement
(including any Schedule hereto) may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in
the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be
effective; provided that (i) after the Company Stockholder Approval has been
obtained there shall be no amendment or waiver that would require the further
approval of the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law without such
approval having first been obtained and (ii) after the Parent Stockholder
Approval has been obtained there shall be no amendment or waiver that would
require the further approval of the stockholders of Parent under Applicable
Law without such approval having first been obtained.

  

  

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

  

  

Section 11.04. Expenses. (a) General. Except as otherwise provided herein, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such cost or expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent and the Company each shall pay 50% of (i) any and all filing fees due

Competition Laws and (ii) any and all filing fees and printing and mailing
costs for the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

  

  

Section 11.05. Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References. (a) The
parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of either the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a)
the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the
relevant party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this
Agreement and (b) any other representations and warranties of such party that
is contained in this Agreement (regardless of the absence of an express
reference or cross reference thereto), but only if the relevance of that
reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such
representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent.

  

  

(b) The parties hereto agree that any information contained in any part of any
Specified Company SEC Document or Specified Parent SEC Document shall only be
deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) the applicable
party's representations and warranties if the relevance

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

85  

  

 

 

 

  

  

of that information as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such
representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent; provided that,
except for any specific factual information contained therein, in no event
shall any information contained in any part of any Specified Company SEC
Document or Specified Parent SEC Document entitled "Risk Factors" (or words of
similar import) or containing a description or explanation of "Forward-Looking
Statements" be deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of)
any representations and warranties of any party contained in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.06. Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided in Section 7.07, shall
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person other than
the parties any rights or remedies, other than (a) as specifically provided in
Section 7.07 and Section 10.02 and (b) the right of the Company, on behalf of
its stockholders, to pursue damages and other relief, including equitable
relief, in the event of Parent's or Merger Subsidiary's (i) intentional and
willful failure to fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations
of any other party hereunder, (ii) failure to perform a covenant hereof or
(iii) willful and material breach of any representation or warranty herein,
which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Subsidiary;
provided, however, that the rights granted pursuant to clause (b) above shall
be enforceable on behalf of holders of Company Stock only by the Company in
its sole and absolute discretion.

  

  

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the
Effective Time, to any Person; provided that such transfer or assignment shall
not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or
enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to
Parent or Merger Subsidiary.

  

  

Section 11.07. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

  

  

Section 11.08. Jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or against any
party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware Chancery
Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located
in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of
the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

86  

  

 

 

 

  

  

fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any
such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit,
action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether
within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the
foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided
in Section 11.01 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

  

  

Section 11.09. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

  

  

Section 11.10. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication). Electronic or facsimile signatures shall be
deemed to be original signatures.

  

  

Section 11.11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the exhibits, schedules and annexes hereto
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to their
subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
oral and written, between the parties with respect to that subject matter.

  

  

Section 11.12. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

  

  

Section 11.13. Specific Performance . The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

87  

  

 

 

 

  

  

breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state
court, without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any
requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of
specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Applicable Law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach.
