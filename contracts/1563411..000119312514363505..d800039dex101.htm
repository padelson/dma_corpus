iii UNIT PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

THIS UNIT PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is effective as of October
3, 2014 among Constellium N.V., a public company with limited liability
existing under the laws of the Netherlands (" _Buyer_ "), Wise Metals Holdings
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Parent_ "), who is the sole
member of Wise Metals Intermediate Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (the " _Company_ "), and Silver Knot, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the " _Representative_ "), solely in its capacity as the
Representative (as defined below). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise
defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning set forth in _Section
11.16_.

 

WHEREAS, Parent owns all of the issued and outstanding units of membership
interest of the Company (the " _Units_ "); and 

WHEREAS, Buyer desires to purchase (or cause one of its subsidiaries to
purchase) from Parent, and Parent desires to sell to Buyer (or Buyers
designated subsidiary), all right, title and interest of Parent in and to the
Units upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
intending to be legally bound, the Parties agree as follows:

1\. PURCHASE AND SALE OF INTERESTS

 

Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Closing, Parent shall sell and transfer to Buyer or Buyers
designated subsidiary, and Buyer or Buyers designated subsidiary shall
purchase and accept from Parent, all right, title and interest of Parent in
and to the Units, free and clear of any Liens.

 

2\. PURCHASE PRICE; PAYMENT

 

2.1 _Purchase Price_.

 

(a) The purchase price payable to Parent for the Units (the " _Membership
Interest Value_ ") shall be an amount equal to: (i) $455,550,843 (the " _Base
Membership Interest Value_ "), (ii) _plus_ the amount, if any, by which the
Closing Date Cash is greater than the Target Cash, (iii) _minus_ the amount,
if any, by which the Closing Date Cash is less than the Target Cash, (iv)
_plus_ the amount, if any, by which the Total Indebtedness Amount is less than
the Target Indebtedness, (v) _minus_ the amount, if any, by which the Total
Indebtedness Amount is greater than the Target Indebtedness, (vi) _plus_ the
amount, if any, by which the Closing Date Net Working Capital is greater than
the Target Net Working Capital, (vii) _minus_ the amount, if any, by which
the Closing Date Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working
Capital, (viii) _minus_ the Capital Expenditures Shortfall, if any, (ix)
_plus_ the Capital Expenditures Surplus, if any and (x) _minus_ the amount
of Transaction Expenses.

 



1 (b) The aggregate purchase price for the Company (the " _Aggregate
Purchase Price_ ") shall be an amount equal to (i) the Membership Interest
Value, (ii) _plus_ the Total Indebtedness Amount, (iii) _minus_ the Closing
Date Cash.

 

2.2 _Estimated Membership Interest Value_. The Parties acknowledge that it is
not possible to determine the Membership Interest Value until the Closing
Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Cash, Total Indebtedness Amount,
Capital Expenditures Shortfall or Capital Expenditures Surplus (as applicable)
and Transaction Expenses have been finally determined in accordance with 
_Section 2.4_. Accordingly, the parties agree that five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing, Parent shall deliver to Buyer a certificate setting
forth Parents reasonable, good faith estimate, calculated in accordance with
the principles and methodologies set forth on _Schedule 11.16_ , of (i) the
Closing Date Cash (the " _Estimated Closing Date Cash_ "), (ii) the Net
Working Capital as of 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on the Closing Date ("
_Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital_ "), (iii) the Total Indebtedness
Amount (the " _Estimated Total Indebtedness Amount_ "), (iv) the Capital
Expenditures Shortfall (the " _Estimated Capital Expenditures Shortfall_ ")
or Capital Expenditures Surplus (the " _Estimated Capital Expenditures
Surplus_ "), as applicable, including a table listing the amounts of Capital
Expenditures in a format consistent with the Capital Expenditure Budget and
(v) the Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "), in
each case, including a schedule setting forth the components thereof and
together with reasonable supporting detail, and on the basis of that
information, Parents good faith estimate of Membership Interest Value (such
estimate, the " _Estimated Membership Interest Value_ "). The Estimated
Membership Interest Value shall be equal to: (i) the Base Membership Interest
Value, (ii) _plus_ the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Date
Cash is greater than the Target Cash, (iii) _minus_ the amount, if any, by
which the Estimated Closing Date Cash is less than the Target Cash, (iv)
_plus_ the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Total Indebtedness Amount is
less than the Target Indebtedness, (v) _minus_ the amount, if any, by which
the Estimated Total Indebtedness Amount is greater than the Target
Indebtedness, (vi) _plus_ the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net Working Capital, (vii)
_minus_ the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital, (viii) _minus_ the
Estimated Capital Expenditures Shortfall, if any, (ix) _plus_ the Estimated
Capital Expenditures Surplus, if any, and (x) _minus_  the amount of the
Estimated Transaction Expenses. Parent shall consider in good faith any
comments of Buyer on the foregoing estimates but, absent manifest error,
Parent shall not be required to adjust its estimates in response to
Buyers comments. Buyer and its representatives shall have reasonable access
to the books and records, personnel and advisors of Parent and the Group to
the extent reasonably required in connection with its review of the foregoing
estimates. For the avoidance of doubt, any failure of Buyer to dispute any
item or aspect of the Estimated Membership Interest Value shall not preclude
Buyer from exercising any other rights under this Agreement.

 

2.3 _Payment_. Buyer or the Escrow Agent, as applicable, shall pay the
following by wire transfer of immediately available funds free of costs and
charges as follows:

 



2 (a) _Payment of Closing Indebtedness Payoff Amount_. At the Closing,
Buyer shall deliver to the applicable obligees, for and on behalf of the
Company, the Closing Indebtedness Payoff Amount in full satisfaction and
retirement of the Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is set
forth on _Schedule 2.3(a)_ and required to be repaid at Closing (the "
_Indebtedness Due at Closing_ "). In order to facilitate such payment, at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain
customary payoff letters for all Indebtedness Due at Closing from all
financial institutions and other Persons to which such Indebtedness Due at
Closing is owed, or the applicable agent, trustee or other Representative on
behalf of such Persons, which payoff letters shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Buyer and shall, among other things, acknowledge the
aggregate principal amount and all accrued but unpaid interest constituting
the Indebtedness Due at Closing and state that upon the payment of such
amount such Indebtedness Due at Closing shall be discharged and that the Liens
(and guarantees), if any, granted in connection therewith shall be released
and terminated.

 

(b) _Payment of Adjustment Escrow Deposit_. At the Closing, Buyer shall
deliver an amount equal to $30,000,000 (the " _Adjustment Escrow Deposit_ ")

deliver an amount equal to $30,000,000 (the " _Indemnification Escrow Deposit_
") to Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement.

 

(d) _Payment of NDT Escrow Deposit_. At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver an
amount equal to the fifty percent (50%) of the amount by which the Remedial
Cost Amount exceeds $20,000,000 (the " _NDT Escrow Deposit_ ") to the Escrow
Agent under the Escrow Agreement. The NDT Escrow Deposit shall only be used to
pay or reimburse Remediation Costs.

(e) _Payment of Closing Date Balance_. At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to
Parent an amount equal to the Estimated Membership Interest Value _minus_ the
Adjustment Escrow Deposit and _minus_ the Indemnification Escrow Deposit.

 

(f) _Payment of Adjustment Amount_. On the fifth (5th) Business Day following
the date on which the last of the Draft Closing Statements have been finally
agreed in accordance with _Section 2.4_ (whether by agreement of the Parties,
deemed agreement or by determination made by the Independent Firm pursuant to
_Section 2.4(c)_) the following payments shall be made:

(i) if (x) the Closing Date Net Working Capital, _plus_ the Closing Date
Cash,  _minus_ the Total Indebtedness Amount, _minus_ the Capital
Expenditures Shortfall, _plus_ the Capital Expenditure Surplus, _minus_ the
Transaction Expenses, is greater than (y) the Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital,  _plus_ the Estimated Closing Date Cash, _minus_ the
Estimated Total Indebtedness Amount, _minus_ the Estimated Capital
Expenditures Shortfall, _plus_ the Estimated Capital Expenditure Surplus,
_minus_ the Estimated Transaction Expenses, then (A) Buyer shall pay such
surplus amount to the Representative on behalf of Parent, and (B) the full
amount of the funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account shall be released to the
Representative (for the benefit of Parent, or if Parent has been dissolved or
liquidated, the members of Parent at the time of such dissolution or
liquidation);

 



3 (ii) if (x) the Closing Date Net Working Capital, _plus_ the Closing Date
Cash, _minus_ the Total Indebtedness Amount, _minus_ the Capital Expenditures
Shortfall, _plus_ the Capital Expenditures Surplus, _minus_ the Transaction
Expenses, is less than (y) the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital,
_plus_ the Estimated Closing Cash, _minus_ the Estimated Total Indebtedness
Amount, _minus_ the Estimated Capital Expenditures Shortfall, _plus_ the
Capital Expenditures Surplus, _minus_ the Estimated Transaction Expenses,
then (A) the amount of such deficiency shall be paid from the Adjustment
Escrow Account to Buyer (provided that such amount paid pursuant to this
clause (ii)(A) shall not exceed the amount of the Adjustment Escrow Amount and
Buyer shall have no recourse against Parent, the Representative, or any other
Person for any such excess), and (B) the funds remaining (if any) in the
Adjustment Escrow Account, after giving effect to clause (ii)(A), shall be
released to the Representative (for the benefit of Parent, or if Parent has
been dissolved or liquidated, the members of Parent at the time of such
dissolution or liquidation); and

 

(iii) if (x) the Closing Date Net Working Capital, _plus_ the Closing Date
Cash, _minus_ the Total Indebtedness Amount, _minus_ the Capital Expenditures
Shortfall, _plus_ the Capital Expenditures Surplus, _minus_ the Transaction
Expenses, is equal to (y) the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital,
_plus_ the Estimated Closing Cash, _minus_ the Estimated Total Indebtedness
Amount, _minus_ the Estimated Capital Expenditures Shortfall, _plus_ the
Capital Expenditures Surplus, _minus_ the Estimated Transaction Expenses, then
the entire amount of the Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be released to the
Representative (for the benefit of Parent, or if Parent has been dissolved or
liquidated, the members of Parent at the time of such dissolution or
liquidation).

 

2.4 _Adjustment_.

 

(a) Not later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, acting
in good faith and using all reasonable efforts, cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Representative: (i) a statement of Net Working Capital as of
12:01 a.m., New York City time, on the Closing Date (the " _Draft Closing Date
Net Working Capital Statement_ " and, as finally determined pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section 2.4_, the " _Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement_ "), which such Draft Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement
shall set out the draft Net Working Capital as of 12:01 a.m., New York City
time, on the Closing Date (such draft Net Working Capital, as finally
determined pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 2.4_, referred to as
the " _Closing Date Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) a calculation of the
Closing Date Cash, (iii) calculation of the Total Indebtedness Amount, (iv) a
calculation of the Capital Expenditures Shortfall or Capital Expenditures
Surplus, as applicable, and (v) a calculation of Transaction Expenses, in
each case including a schedule setting forth the components thereof with

 



4  reasonable supporting detail. The Representative shall reasonably cooperate
with Buyer and its accountants to the extent required to prepare the Draft
Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement and the calculation of the Closing
Date Cash, the Total Indebtedness Amount, the Capital Expenditures Shortfall
or Capital Expenditures Surplus (as applicable) and Transaction Expenses
(collectively, the " _Draft Closing Statements_ "). The Draft Closing
Statements shall be prepared in accordance with this Agreement and the
methodologies and principles set forth on _Schedule 11.16_.

 

(b) If the Representative notifies Buyer that Parent agrees with any of the
Draft Closing Statements within forty-five (45) days after receipt thereof or
fails to deliver notice to Buyer of its disagreement therewith within such
forty-five (45) day period, any such Draft Closing Statements shall be
conclusive and binding on Parent and Buyer and the parties shall be deemed to
have agreed thereto, in the first case, on the date Buyer receives the notice
and, in the second case, on such forty-fifth (45th) day. If the Representative
disagrees with any of the Draft Closing Statements or the calculations set
forth therein, then the Representative shall notify Buyer of its disagreement
(the " _Dispute Notice_ ") within such forty-five (45) day period together
with reasonable particulars of the basis of such dispute, including
underlying calculations as well as the Representatives position on the
amounts in dispute. In such event, the Representative and Buyer shall work
expeditiously and attempt, in good faith, to resolve their differences with
respect thereto within thirty (30) days after the receipt by Buyer of the
Dispute Notice and make any amendments to the Draft Closing Statements as
mutually agreed to by the parties.

 

(c) If Buyer and the Representative are unable to resolve any dispute over any
of the Draft Closing Statements or the calculation of Closing Date Net
Working Capital as set forth in the Dispute Notice within thirty (30) days of
receipt of the Dispute Notice (or such other period as the parties may agree),
then, at any time thereafter, either Buyer or the Representative may elect to
have such dispute resolved by KPMG, or another nationally recognized firm of
independent public accountants as to which Buyer and the Representative
mutually agree (the " _Independent Firm_ "), which shall, acting as an expert
and not as an arbitrator, determine on the basis of the standards expressly
set forth in this Agreement and the methodologies and principles set forth on
_Schedule 11.16_ , and only with respect to the remaining differences so
submitted to the Independent Firm (and not by independent review), whether and
to what extent, if any, the amounts reflected in the Draft Closing Statements
require adjustment. In connection with the engagement of the Independent Firm,
Buyer and the Representative shall execute reasonable engagement letters and
supply such other documents and information as the Independent Firm reasonably
requires and such other information as such Party reasonably deems
appropriate. The Independent Firm shall be instructed to use every reasonable
effort to perform its services within thirty (30) days after submission of the
dispute to it and, in any case, as soon as practicable after such submission.
In resolving any dispute, the Independent Firm (A) shall be bound by the
terms of this Agreement, including the principles of this _Section 2.4_ and
the methodologies and illustration set forth on _Schedule 11.16_ , and (B)
shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by Buyer or the Representative, or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by Buyer or the Representative, as set forth in the
Draft Closing Statements or the Dispute Notice. Absent fraud or manifest
error, the

 



5  Independent Firms determination of the dispute shall be conclusive and
binding upon both Parties. All fees and expenses of the Independent Firm in
connection with the services provided pursuant to this _Section 2.4(c)_
shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Parent.

(d) During the period from the date the Draft Closing Statements are
delivered by Buyer to the Representative through the date such statements are
finally determined in accordance with the terms of this _Section 2.4_, Buyer
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, take any action with
respect to the accounting books, records, policies and procedures of the
Company and its Subsidiaries that would obstruct or prevent the preparation or
review of the Draft Closing Statements. Buyer shall cooperate, and shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate, with the Representative
in the review of the Draft Closing Statements and, if applicable, Buyers
response to a Dispute Notice, including (i) providing the Representative and
its Representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to the
books, records (including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other
documents), facilities and employees of the foregoing, and (ii)
cooperating in all reasonable respects with the Representative and its
representatives, including the provision on a timely basis of all other
information reasonably requested by Representative which is necessary or
useful in connection with the review of the Draft Closing Statements and, if
applicable, Buyers response to a Dispute Notice.

(e) For greater certainty, each of the Closing Date Net Working Capital,
Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement, Draft Closing Date Net Working
Capital Statement, Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital and Target Net
Working Capital are to be calculated and prepared in a manner consistent, and
in accordance with, the indicative Net Working Capital calculation and other
principles and methodologies set forth in _Schedule 11.16_, and each of the
Closing Date Cash, the Total Indebtedness Amount, the Capital Expenditures
Shortfall, the Capital Expenditures Surplus and the Transaction Expenses are
to be calculated and prepared in a manner consistent, and in accordance with,
this Agreement and the principles and methodologies set forth in  _Schedule
11.16_.

(f) After the determination of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing
Date Cash, the Total Indebtedness Amount, the Capital Expenditures Shortfall
or Capital Expenditures Surplus, as applicable, the Transaction Expenses and
the payments contemplated by _Section 2.3(f)_, no Party shall have the right
to make any claim based on the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working
Capital, Closing Date Cash, the Total Indebtedness Amount, the Capital
Expenditures Shortfall or Capital Expenditures Surplus, as applicable, the
Transaction Expenses or the calculation of any adjustment related thereto
(even if subsequent events or subsequently discovered facts would have
affected such calculations had such subsequent events or subsequently
discovered facts been known at the time of the Closing).

 



6 2.5 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
Buyer, the Company, and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold any consideration paid or delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, to any Person such amounts that
Buyer, the Company, and the Escrow Agent are required to deduct and withhold
with respect to any such deliveries and payments under the Code or any
provision of state, local, provincial or foreign law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, and duly deposited with the appropriate Governmental
Entity, by Buyer, the Company or the Escrow Agent, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

3\. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

3.1 _Representations and Warranties of Parent_. Except as set forth in the
corresponding sections of the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to
Buyer concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "
_Disclosure Schedule_ "), Parent makes the following representations and
warranties to Buyer:

 

(a) Organization and Power.

 

(i) _Parent_. Parent is a limited liability company duly organized and validly
existing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Parent has all requisite
company power, legal right and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and the other documents and instruments to be executed and delivered by Parent
pursuant hereto and to carry out the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Parent has provided to Buyer, prior to the date hereof, complete and
correct copies of the articles of formation and operating agreement (and all
other similar organizational documents) of Parent, and there are no other
documents or agreements governing the rights or obligations of any of the
equityholders of Parent.

(ii) _Company; Subsidiaries_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is an
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries has all requisite company power, legal right and authority
to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as and
where it currently conducts its business. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign entity
in each jurisdiction wherein the character of the properties owned by it, or
the nature of its business, makes such qualification or licensure necessary,
except where the failure to effect or maintain such qualification or
licensure would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect. Parent has made available to Buyer complete and correct copies of the

Company or any of its Subsidiaries participate or is obligated to contribute,
or for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any liability, with
respect to Current Employees or Former Employees.

(ii) _Documentation_. With respect to each material Company Benefit Plan, to

contribute), none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any withdrawal or partial withdrawal
liability under Title IV of ERISA that remains unsatisfied, and no such
Multiemployer Plan is in "reorganization" or "insolvent" (as those terms are
defined in Section 4241 and 4245 of ERISA, respectively). Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received notice with respect to any Multiemployer
Plan of any failure by such Multiemployer Plan to satisfy the minimum funding
requirements of Section 412 of the Code or its endangered or critical status
under Section 432 of the Code, or any application for or receipt of a waiver
of such minimum funding requirements with respect to such Multiemployer Plan.
_Section 3.1(t)(iii)(B)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of each
Company Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA. With respect to any Company
Benefit Plan that is a plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, neither Parent nor
any ERISA Affiliate (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) has incurred
any liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than for the payment of premiums
due in the ordinary course to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation), and
no condition or event currently exists that would reasonably be expected to
subject Parent, the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates to any liability under Title IV of ERISA or
the imposition of any Lien under Title IV of ERISA.

(iv) _Compliance_. Each Company Benefit Plan is in compliance, in all

21  relating to the Company Benefit Plans required to be filed with any
Governmental Entity or provided to participants or their beneficiaries have
been timely filed and provided. There is no material litigation, arbitration
or similar proceeding pending (other than routine claims for benefits being
reviewed pursuant to the plans internal claim and approval process) or, to
the knowledge of Parent, threatened with respect to any Company Benefit Plan
or against the assets of any Company Benefit Plan. Each Company Benefit Plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is covered by a
favorable IRS determination letter as to the tax-qualified status of the plan
and trust. To the knowledge of Parent, no person has engaged in a "prohibited

former employee, officer, director or independent contractor of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to any payment or benefit (or result in the funding of
any such payment or benefit) under any Company Benefit Plan; (B) increase the
amount of any compensation, equity award or other benefits otherwise payable
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any Company Benefit Plan; (C)

compensation, equity award or other benefits under any Company Benefit Plan;
or (D) limit or restrict the right of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
to merge, amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan.

 

(vii) _No Parachute Payments_. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) result in any "excess
parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) becoming
due to any current or former employee, officer, director or independent
contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(viii) _Section 409A Compliance_. Each "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) subject to Section 409A
of the Code and the regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder

Regulatory Laws to terminate or expire at the earliest possible date (and in
any event within the first phase of review), to avoid the filing of any
suit or proceeding by any Governmental Entity seeking to enjoin the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to avoid the

or other Order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in

appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated
by _subclauses (i)_, _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ of this _Section 4.3(c)_)
necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or other Order, in each
case of _subclauses (i)_ ,  _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ and _(iv)_ , to allow the
Closing to occur as soon as possible; provided that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall not be required to become
subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect
to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or Order of a
Governmental Entity to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to
conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change assets or businesses
of Buyer or its Subsidiaries; provided further, that notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall not be required to (and the

otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise
change assets or businesses of the Company or its Subsidiaries that would
comprise assets of the Group to which revenue of more than $50 million was
attributable in fiscal year 2013. Any proposing, negotiating, committing to
and effecting any divesture, sale, disposition, hold separate, or limitation
on freedom of action with regard to any aspect of the Company or any of its

respective Affiliates to: (i) cooperate with the other Party with respect to
any filing, investigation, inquiry or action in connection with the

of all filings, notices and other written communications (and a summary of
any oral communications) submitted or made by any Party or its Affiliates to

representation or warranty of the other party set forth in this Agreement is
not true and correct or if it obtains knowledge of any errors in, or
omissions from, the Disclosure Schedule or of any condition or circumstance
that could excuse Buyer or Parent from timely performance of its obligations
hereunder or give rise to a claim by Buyer or Parent hereunder, provided that
any failure to provide notice shall not affect the rights or obligations of
any Party has under this Agreement. Buyers rights under this Agreement shall
not be affected or deemed waived by reason of the fact that Buyer or any of
its Representatives knew or should have known that any representation or
warranty is, was or might be inaccurate.

this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges that the Company and its Subsidiaries have

ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide the Current Employees, at a

Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company provide for the benefit of Current
Employees pursuant to the terms thereof. Buyer shall, or shall cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries to, recognize all service credited under a
Company Benefit Plan through the Closing for purposes of vesting and
entitlement to benefits and level of benefits under any similar benefit plan,
program or arrangement provided for the benefit of the Current Employees or
Former Employees after the Closing, except (A) for purposes of benefit accrual
under any defined benefit pension plan or (B) to the extent such service
credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of
service. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-
existing condition (or actively at work or similar) limitations, eligibility
waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements and other conditions
under any group health and welfare plans to be waived with respect to Current
Employees and their respective eligible dependents. Buyer shall provide
Current Employees and their respective eligible dependents with credit for
any co-payments, deductibles and offsets (or similar payments) made during the

Employees (including Former Employees whose "qualifying event" occurred prior
to the Closing).

Current Employees or Former Employees or any dependent or beneficiary thereof,
or (B) to continued employment with Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit
Plan or employee benefit plan maintained by Buyer or its Subsidiaries, or
(iii) shall limit the right of Buyer or its Subsidiaries to amend, terminate

maintained by Buyer or its Subsidiaries.

each Party shall afford the other Party and its counsel, accountants and
other Representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice, reasonable access to the books, records and other information in such
Partys possession or control relating to the assets, liabilities or
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to periods prior
to the Closing, and the right to make copies and extracts therefrom at its
expense, to the extent such access is reasonably required by the requesting
Party for any proper business purpose. Without limitation, for a period of
five (5) years after the Closing, each Party shall make available to the other
Party, as reasonably requested, and to any Tax authority that is
legally permitted to receive the following pursuant to its subpoena power or
its equivalent, all books, records and other information relating to Tax
Liabilities or potential Tax Liabilities for all periods prior to or including

information until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations for
assessment or refund of Taxes or extensions thereof. Subject to the previous
sentence, each Party agrees, for a period of six years after the Closing
Date, not to destroy or otherwise dispose of any of the books, records or
other information described in this _Section 5.2(a)_ until the expiration of
the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such books,
records or other information relate (without regard to extensions except to
the extent notified by the other Party in writing of such extensions for the
respective Tax Periods), without first offering in writing to surrender such
books, records and other information to the other Party, which other Party
shall have ten days after such offer to agree in writing to take possession
thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, after the Closing, books, records and
other information in the possession or control of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed in Buyers possession or control for purposes of
this _Section 5.2(a)_.

 

(b) _Cooperation_. After the Closing, each Party shall cooperate, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with (i)

by this Agreement or (B) any fact or condition relating to the Companys
business, Liabilities or assets prior to the Closing. Such cooperation

under such circumstances so as not to unreasonably disrupt business, the
relevant books, records, information and employees of the cooperating Party,
allowing the relevant personnel of the cooperating Party to assist the
requesting Party in participating in any such matter, executing and delivering
documents or instruments and taking all such action as the requesting Party
reasonably requests in connection with such matter; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the requesting Party shall promptly reimburse the cooperating Party for
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs directly relating to such cooperation of
any of the cooperating Partys employees who assist the requesting Party.

5.3 _Directors, Officers and Employees_.

(a) _Cooperation_. For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer
shall cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to respond to and defend
against any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, arbitration, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal or administrative, in which
any Person who is now, or who at any time prior to the date of this Agreement
was, or who prior to the Closing becomes, a director or officer of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any other entity that the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries owned an equity security (including in his or her role as
a fiduciary of employee benefit plans) (collectively, the " _Indemnified
Agents_ ") is, or is threatened to be, made a party or witness, in whole or in
part, as a result of or relating to (i) the fact that at any time prior to
the Closing he or she is or was a director or officer of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries, any other entity that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
owned an equity security or any predecessor of any of the foregoing
(including in his or her role as a fiduciary of employee benefit plans) or
(ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether
asserted or arising before or after the Closing, except in each case of the
foregoing _subclauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , other than to the extent that any of
the foregoing arises from the Indemnified Agents bad faith, willful
misconduct, gross negligence or breach of this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Agent Claims_ ").

(b) _Indemnification_. For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer
shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, each Indemnified Agent from and against all losses, claims, damages and
liabilities, joint or several, to which such Indemnified Agent may become
subject under any applicable Law or otherwise and relating to, arising out of
or in connection with any Indemnified Agent Claim and (ii) reimburse each
Indemnified Agent for all reasonable expenses (including reasonable fees and
expenses of legal counsel) as they are incurred in connection with any
Indemnified Agent Claim.

(c) _Insurance_. Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall obtain and pay for a so-
called "tail" or extended reporting period insurance policy providing for Side
A coverage for the current directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who are covered by the current directors and officers
liability insurance policy of Parent. Such coverage shall provide for an
extended reporting period for reporting claims thereunder of six years from
and after the Closing and provide benefits and levels of 

 



37  coverage on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope) providing
substantially equivalent benefits in the aggregate as the current directors
and officers liability insurance policy of Parent with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing (including in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if such insurance coverage can only be obtained at an annual
premium in excess of 300% of the annual premium of such current policy, Buyer
shall only be obligated to obtain one or more policies with the greatest
coverage available for an aggregate premium equal to 300% of such
current annual premium.

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)

then, and in each such case, Buyer shall cause proper provision to be made so
that the successors and assigns of Buyer assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 5.3_.

 

(e) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this _Section 5.3_ are (i)
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Agent and his or her heirs and Representatives and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution of, any other rights, including rights to
indemnification and advancement of expenses, that any Indemnified Agent may
be entitled to, or hereafter acquire, under any Law, Contract, charter
document or otherwise.

5.4  _Nondisclosure_. From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall not, and
shall cause its Representatives and Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly
disclose to any Person, other than Buyer and its Affiliates, any information
concerning the business and affairs of the Company that is not already
generally available to the public or that does not become generally available
after the date of this Agreement, in each case without any violation by Parent
of its obligations hereunder, and from and after the date hereof, Parent
shall not, and shall cause its Representatives and Affiliates not to, directly
or indirectly disclose to any Person, any information concerning the business
and affairs of Buyer and its Affiliates that is not already generally
available to the public or that does not become generally available after the
date of this Agreement, in each case without any violation by Parent of its
obligations hereunder (the " _Confidential Information_ "). In the event that
Parent or any of its Affiliates is requested or required (by oral question or
request for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory,
subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose
any Confidential Information, such party shall notify Buyer promptly of the
request or requirement so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order
or waive compliance with the provisions of this _Section 5.4_. If, in the
absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Parent or
any of its Affiliates is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any
Confidential Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt,
such party may disclose the Confidential Information to the tribunal;
_provided_ that such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, at
the request and expense of Buyer, an order or other assurance that
confidential treatment shall be accorded to such portion of the Confidential
Information required to be disclosed as Buyer shall designate.

 



38 5.5 _Representative_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Silver Knot, LLC shall be constituted and appointed as the
Representative. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Representative_ "
shall mean the representative, true and lawful agent, proxy and attorney in
fact of Parent for all purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,

transactions contemplated herein, (ii) to pay Parents expenses (whether
incurred on or after the date hereof) incurred in connection with the
negotiation and performance of this Agreement, (iii) to receive, give receipt
and disburse any funds received hereunder on behalf of or to Parent and to
holdback from disbursement any such funds to the extent it reasonably
determines may be necessary, (iv) to execute and deliver any certificates
representing the Units and execution of such further instruments as Buyer
shall reasonably request, (v) to execute and deliver on behalf of Parent all
documents contemplated herein and any amendment or waiver hereto, (vi) to take
all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of Parent in connection
herewith, (vii) to negotiate, settle, compromise and otherwise handle all

executing this Agreement, irrevocably grants unto said attorney-in-fact and
agent full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing
necessary or desirable to be done in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as fully to all intents and purposes as Parent
might or could do itself. Parent agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled

object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same, except for fraud, bad
faith or willful misconduct. Neither the Representative nor any agent employed

performance of its duties hereunder except for actions or omissions
constituting fraud, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Representative shall
not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of
Parent, except in respect of amounts actually received on behalf of Parent.
The Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either
the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of

the actual Tax Returns to be provided by the preparing Party to the other
Party at least ten (10) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of

practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries or Parent with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries. The Representative and Parent shall cause to be
paid to Buyer any Excluded Taxes relating to any Tax Return described in this
_Section 5.6(c)_ that is required to be filed by Buyer or the Company no

required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of _Section
1313(a)_ of the Code or otherwise by applicable Law.

 

(d) The Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that for all income Tax purposes

of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than the assets of the Corporate
Subsidiaries) and (ii) any indemnity payment made under this Agreement and any
payment made pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_ shall be treated as an adjustment
to the Aggregate Purchase Price, and none of the Parties shall take any
position inconsistent with such treatment on any Tax Return or for any other
Tax purposes.

 

(e) The Membership Interest Value (and the Total Indebtedness Amounts, any
other assumed liabilities and any other relevant items for Tax purposes), as

assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with Code Section
1060 and the regulations thereunder and consistent with their fair market
values, which allocation shall reflect and be consistent with _Schedule 5.6_
(the " _Allocation_ "). The parties acknowledge and agree that no portion of
the Membership Interest Value shall be allocated to the covenants not to
compete set forth in _Section 5.10_ or similar arrangements as defined in
Code Section 197(d)(1)(E). No later than sixty (60) days prior to the earlier
of the due date for filing the U.S. federal income tax returns of Parent or
Buyer or, if applicable, Buyers designated subsidiary pursuant to Section 1
(or if Buyer or such designated subsidiary is a member of a group filing a
consolidated Tax Return for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the parent of
such group), Buyer shall deliver to Parent a draft of the Allocation, which
shall reflect and be consistent with principles set forth in this _Section
5.6_ and in _Schedule 5._ 6 for Parents review and approval. In the event of
any dispute regarding the Allocation, the dispute resolution principles of
_Section 2.4(c)_ shall apply. Each of the Parties agrees to (a) be bound by
such allocation (as prepared by Buyer or as determined pursuant to
the dispute resolution principles of _Section 2.4(c)_, the " _Final
Allocation_ "), (b) act in accordance with the Final Allocation in the
preparation and filing of all Tax Returns and in the course of any Tax audit,

cause their Affiliates to take no position, inconsistent with such Final

such refund as a payment in actual reduction of Taxes otherwise then owed in
cash for a Post-Closing Tax Period) for a Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent
(i) paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing or
paid or indemnified by Parent or (ii) attributable, or resulting from, any
carryforward of net operating losses or other losses, credits or other Tax
attributes arising in a Pre-Closing Tax Period to another Pre-Closing Tax
Period or, in the case of a refund of Taxes for a Straddle Period, the use of
the amount of any such net operating losses, other losses, credits or other
Tax attributes in a Pre-Closing Tax Period as determined pursuant to the
methodologies set forth in _Section 5.6(g)_ (in each case, other than (x) a
refund attributable to, or resulting from, any carryback of net operating
losses or other losses, credits or other Tax attributes arising in a Post-
Closing Tax Period or, in the case of a refund of Taxes for a Straddle Period,

Buyer shall promptly pay an amount equal to such refund to Parent, less
any out-of-pocket reasonable costs or any Taxes incurred by Buyer or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as the result of the receipt of such Tax
refund. The net amount due to Parent shall be payable ten (10) days after
receipt of the refund from the applicable Governmental Authority (or, if the
refund is in the form of direct credit, ten (10) days after filing the Tax
Return claiming such credit). The amount of any other refund or Tax Benefit of
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries shall be for the account of Buyer.

(g) In the case of Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are
payable with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes
that are treated as taxes of the Company or such Subsidiaries for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period for purposes of this Agreement shall be:

 

(i) in the case of Taxes based upon, or related to, income, receipts, sales,
or payroll, deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable
year ended with the Closing Date; and

(ii) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for
the entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire period.

 

(h) After the date hereof, neither Parent nor the Representative shall file,
or cause or permit to be filed, any entity classification elections pursuant
to Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3(c) with respect to the Company or

which Parent is reasonably expected to indemnify Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement, the portion of any Straddle Period ending on and including the
Closing Date (in each case, other than any such Tax Proceeding if the
Indemnity Escrow Deposit at any time during the pendency of such Tax
Proceeding (less an amount in cash equal to the sum of any amounts subject to
any other outstanding claims made by any Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to
_Article 9_ or  _Section 5.6_ that have not been finally determined in
accordance with _Article 9_ or _Section 5.6_) are reasonably expected to be

9\. INDEMNIFICATION

9.1  _Survival_. Subject to the limitations and other provisions of this
Agreement, the representations and warranties contained herein shall survive
the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until the date that is
eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, any
claims for indemnification under _Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ must be
brought on or before the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims asserted in good faith with
reasonable specificity (to the extent known at such time) and in writing by
notice from the non-breaching Party to the breaching Party prior to the
expiration date of the applicable survival period shall not thereafter be
barred by the expiration of the relevant representation or warranty and such
claims shall survive until finally resolved.

 

9.2 _Indemnification by Parent_. Subject to the other terms and conditions of
this _Article 9_ , after the Closing, Parent shall indemnify, defend and
reimburse each of Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) and their respective Representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer
Indemnitees_ ") against, and shall hold each of them harmless from and
against any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the
Buyer Indemnitees based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Parent contained in this
Agreement, as of the date of such representation or warranty was made or as
if such representation or warranty was made on and as of the Closing Date
(except for representations and warranties that expressly relate to a
specified date, the breach of which will be determined with reference to
such specified date); or

(b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by
Parent pursuant to this Agreement.

9.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to the other terms and conditions of
this _Article 9_ , after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and
reimburse each of Parent and its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives (collectively, the " _Parent Indemnitees_ ") against, and
shall hold each of them harmless from and against any and all Losses incurred
or sustained by, or imposed upon, the Parent Indemnitees based upon, arising
out of, with respect to or by reason of:

 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this
Agreement, as of the date of such representation or warranty was made or as
if such representation or warranty was made on and as of the Closing Date
(except for representations and warranties that expressly relate to a
specified date, the breach of which will be determined with reference to
such specified date); or

 



51 (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

9.4 _Certain Limitations_. The indemnification obligations provided for in
_Section 9.2_ and _ Section 9.3_ shall be subject to the following
limitations:

(a) Parent shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnitees for indemnification
under _Section 9.2(a)_ until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of
indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)_ exceeds the amount equal to $4,000,000
(the " _Basket_ "), in which event Parent shall have liability only for the
amount of such excess. The aggregate amount of all Losses for which Parent
shall be liable pursuant to _Section 9.2_ shall be limited in the aggregate
to the Indemnification Escrow Amount then remaining in the Indemnification
Escrow Account at the time of any claim thereunder. With respect to any claim
as to which the Buyer Indemnitees may be entitled to indemnification under
_Section 9.2(a),_ Parent shall not be liable for any Loss unless it exceeds,
individually or together with all Losses resulting from the same or series of
related facts, events or circumstances, $50,000.

 

(b) Buyer shall not be liable to the Parent Indemnitees for indemnification
under _Section 9.3(a)_ until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect
of indemnification under _Section 9.3(a)_ exceeds the Basket, in which event
Buyer shall have liability only for the amount of such excess. The aggregate
amount of all Losses for which Buyer shall be liable pursuant to _Section
9.3_ shall not exceed $30,000,000. With respect to any claim as to which the
Parent Indemnitees may be entitled to indemnification under _Section 9.3(a)_,
Buyer shall not be liable for any Loss unless it exceeds, individually or
together with all Losses resulting from the same or series of related facts,
events or circumstances, $50,000.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in the first
sentence of each of _Section 9.4(a)_ and  _9.4(b)_ this shall not apply to
Losses based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty in _Section_
_3.1(a)_ , _Section 3.1(b)_,  _Section 3.1(d)_, _Section 3.1(e)_, _Section
3.1(g), Section 3.1(w)_, _Section 3.2(a)_ and _Section 3.2(g)_.

 

(d) For purposes of calculating Losses under _Article 9_ arising from a breach
of representation or warranty hereunder (but not for purposes of determining
whether a breach has occurred), any materiality or Material Adverse Effect
qualifications contained therein shall be disregarded.

 

(e) Parent shall not have any liability pursuant to _Section 9.2_ in respect
of any item or any Losses to the extent they have been reflected as a
deduction in determining the Membership Interest Value hereunder or as
otherwise reflected as a deduction in the calculation of Closing Date Net
Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.4_. 

 



52 (f) No limitation in this _Section 9.4_ shall apply to any Losses
with respect to, resulting from or involving, fraud (with actual intent to
deceive). For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.4 shall not apply with
respect to Remediation Costs payable or reimbursable by Parent from the NDT
Escrow Deposit pursuant to _Exhibit B_.

9.5 _Indemnification Procedures_. The Party making a claim under this _Article
9_ is referred to as the " _Indemnified Party_ ", and the Party against whom
such claims are asserted under this _Article 9_ is referred to as the "
_Indemnifying Party_."

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or
a Representative of the foregoing (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated
to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in
any event not later than thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of such
notice of such Third Party Claim. The failure to give such prompt written
notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent (i) that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure,
(ii) as a result of such failure, the Indemnifying Party is deprived of its
right to recover any payment under its applicable insurance coverage, or (iii)
the Indemnifying Party is otherwise adversely affected or damaged as a result
of such failure to give timely notice. Such notice by the Indemnified Party
shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall include
copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may
be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying
Partys expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel by providing
written notice of such election to the Indemnified Party within forty-five
(45) days of the Indemnifying Partys receipt of written notice of the Third
Party Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such
defense. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any
Third Party Claim, subject to _Section 9.4(b)_, it shall have the right
to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal
or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the name and
on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel
selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to control the
defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party, provided _,_ that if in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses
available to an Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to
those available to the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot
be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel to the Indemnified 

 



53  Party in each jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party determines
counsel is required. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, in good faith and subject to _Section
9.4(b)_, defend such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and
all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim, and
the Indemnifying Party shall have the right at its expense to participate in
the defense of such Third Party Claim, assisted by counsel of its own
choosing. Parent and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable
respects in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim, including
making available (subject to the provisions of _Section 5.4_) records
relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than
reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending
party, management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably
necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 

(b) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, except as provided in this  _Section 9.4(b)_ the
Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If a firm offer is made to
settle a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a
financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third
Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such
offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within ten days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party
may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such event,
the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party Claim
shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party
fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party
Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to _Section
9.4(a)_, it shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of
the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
that does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30)
days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim. The
failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent (i) that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason
of such failure, (ii) as a result of such failure, the Indemnifying Party is
deprived of its right to recover any payment under its applicable insurance
coverage, or (iii) the Indemnifying Party is otherwise adversely affected or
damaged as a result of such failure to give timely notice. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail,
shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall have 

 



54  thirty (30) days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to
such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such
thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have
rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to
pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms
and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

 

(d) General.

 

(i) From and after the Closing, the Indemnification Escrow Deposit shall serve
as security for Parents indemnification obligations set forth in this
_Article 9_ and _Section 5.6_, and except with respect to (x) injunctive
relief (including specific performance) if available under applicable Law with
respect to any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or (y) any
other remedy available at law or in equity for any fraud (with actual intent
to deceive), the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall (in the case of Section
5.6, with respect to Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries) be the sole
and exclusive source of recovery for Buyer for any claim (whether such claim
is framed in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement.

 

(ii) Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
Losses in connection with this Agreement and the Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts (which shall not include any obligation to
bring legal action) to seek recovery under all insurance policies with respect
to any Losses (with any cost and expense of the foregoing being included as
Losses). The amount which the Indemnifying Party is or may be required to pay
to any Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article 9_ shall be reduced
(retroactively, if necessary) by any insurance proceeds or other amounts
actually recovered by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party in reduction of
the related Losses, net of any deductibles or other expenses incurred in
connection therewith. If an Indemnified Party shall have received the payment
required by this Agreement from the Indemnifying Party in respect of Losses
and shall subsequently receive insurance proceeds or other amounts in respect
of such Losses, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly repay to the
Indemnifying Party a sum equal to the amount of such net insurance proceeds
or other net amounts actually received.

(iii) The indemnification provided in this _Article 9_ and _Section 5.6_
shall be the exclusive post-Closing remedy available to any Party hereto with
respect to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
in this Agreement, or otherwise in respect of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; provided, however, that this _Section 9.5(d)(iii)_ shall
not prohibit (a) injunctive relief (including specific performance) if
available under applicable Law with respect to any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or (b) any other remedy available at law or in
equity for any fraud (with actual intent to deceive).

 



55 (iv) The payment required by this Agreement from the Indemnifying Party
with respect to Losses shall be (A) reduced by the value of any Tax Benefit
actually realized in cash (or resulting in an actual reduction of current cash
taxes payable) by the Indemnified Party, its Subsidiaries and/or any of its
Affiliates as a result of incurring such Losses to the extent such Tax
Benefit is so realized in the year such Loss is incurred (such Tax Benefit a
"Covered Tax Benefit") and (B) increased by the amount of any Taxes incurred
by the Indemnified Party, its Subsidiaries and/or any of its Affiliates as a
result of such payment in the year such payment is made or accrued. To the
extent the Indemnified Party, its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective
Affiliates realize a Covered Tax Benefit and such Covered Tax Benefit was not
included in the computation of the Losses, the Indemnified Party shall within
ten (10) days of actually realizing the Covered Tax Benefit in cash pay over
to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such Covered Tax Benefit.

(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 9.5_ shall not apply with
respect to Remediation Costs payable or reimbursable by Parent from the NDT
Escrow Deposit, which shall be subject to the terms and limitations set forth
in _Exhibit B_.

 

10\. TERMINATION

10.1  _General_. Prior to Closing, this Agreement may be terminated, and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned, as follows (and only as
follows):

 

(a) by the written agreement of Buyer and Parent;

 

(b) by Buyer or Parent if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to
July 3, 2015 or such other date as Buyer and Parent shall agree in writing
(the " _Termination Date_ "); provided, however, that if a Party seeking
termination pursuant to this _subclause (b)_ is in breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement and such
breach would allow the other Party to refuse to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement due to the condition set forth in _Section
6.1_, _Section 6.2_, _Section 7.1_ or  _Section 7.2_ (as applicable), then
that Party may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _subclause (b)_ ;

 

(c) by Buyer providing written notice to Parent if there has been a breach of
the representations and warranties or covenants and agreements by Parent set
forth in this Agreement, which would result in the failure of the conditions
set forth in _Sections 6.1_ or _6.2_ to be satisfied (but not waived) (so long
as Buyer has provided Parent with written notice of such breach and the
breach has continued without cure until the earliest to occur of (i) ten (10)
days following the date of such notice of breach and (ii) the Termination
Date);

 



56 (d) by Parent, providing written notice to Buyer if there has been a breach
of the representations and warranties or covenants and agreements by Buyer
set forth in this Agreement, which would result in the failure of the
conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 or 7.2 to be satisfied (but not waived)
(so long as Parent has provided Buyer with written notice of such breach and
the breach has continued without cure until the earliest to occur of (i) ten
(10) days following the date of such notice of breach and (ii) the Termination
Date); or

 

(e) by Buyer or Parent if any Governmental Entity having competent
jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any
Law or Order, or refused to grant any required consent or approval, that has
the effect of making the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement illegal or that otherwise prohibits the consummation of such
transactions and such Order or other action shall have become final and non-
appealable; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 10.1(e)_ shall not be available to a Party if such
Order or other action was primarily due to the failure of such Party to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement.

10.2  _Post-Termination Obligations_. To terminate this Agreement as provided
in _Section 10.1(b)_, _(c)_ , _(d)_ or _(e)_ , the terminating Party shall
provide the other Party with written notice of its election to terminate this
Agreement. Upon delivery of such written notice in accordance with _Section
11.10_ or a written agreement of Buyer and Parent to terminate this Agreement
as provided in subclause (a) of _Section 10.1_:

 

(a) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated,
without further action by any Party;

 

(b) Buyer shall return or destroy all documents and other materials relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement received from or on behalf
of Parent or the Company (and all copies thereof), whether so obtained before,
on or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, to the Company in
accordance with, and in the manner prescribed by, the Confidentiality
Agreement; and

(c) all confidential information relating to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, Parent or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
received or accumulated by Buyer or its Representatives from Parent, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives shall be
treated as "Evaluation Material" in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement (as supplemented by this Agreement), which shall remain in full
force and effect, as supplemented by this Agreement, notwithstanding the
termination of this Agreement.

 

10.3 _No Liabilities in Event of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated
as provided in _Section 10.1_, then this Agreement shall forthwith become
wholly void and of no further force and effect, and there shall be no
liability under this Agreement on the part of the Parties, except that the
respective obligations of the Parties under _Section 4.1(c)_ and the
provisions of _Section 10.2_ and _Article 11_ (and the Confidentiality
Agreement) shall remain in full force and effect; provided, however, that
termination shall not relieve either Party from liabilities for damages
incurred or suffered by the other Party as a result of any willful and
material breach prior to such termination of any of such Partys
representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement.

 



57 11\. MISCELLANEOUS

 

11.1 _Further Assurances_. From time to time after the date of this Agreement,
upon request and without further consideration, each Party shall execute and
deliver to the requesting Party such documents and take such action as the
requesting Party reasonably requests to consummate more effectively the intent
and purpose of the Parties under this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

11.2 _Publicity_. The Parties agree that no public release or announcement
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be issued
or made by or on behalf of a Party or any of its Affiliates without the prior
written consent of Buyer and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (a) as such release or announcement
may, in the reasonable judgment of the releasing Party, be required by Law or
any rule or regulation of any United States securities exchange on which
securities of the releasing Party are listed, in which case the Party
required to make the release or announcement shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance, and (b) that Parent may cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and Buyer may and may cause its Subsidiaries, to
make such announcements to their respective employees. The Parties agree to
keep the terms of this Agreement confidential, except to the extent required
by applicable Law or any rule or regulation of any United States securities
exchange on which securities of the releasing Party are listed or for
financial reporting purposes and except that (i) the Parties may disclose such
terms to their respective accountants and other Representatives as necessary
in connection with the ordinary conduct of their respective businesses (so
long as such Persons keep the terms of this Agreement confidential as
contemplated above) and (ii) Buyer may disclose such terms as reasonably
required in connection with its financing arrangements. Parent and Buyer agree
that the initial press release to be issued in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be in a form mutually agreed by them. 

11.3 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that the
rights of each party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are
unique and recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of this
Agreement by any party, money damages would be inadequate and the non-
breaching party would have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the parties
agree that such non-breaching party shall have the right, in addition to any
other rights and remedies existing in their favor at law or in equity, to
enforce their rights and the other partys obligations hereunder not only by
an action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions for
specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without
posting of bond or other security).

 



58 11.4 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement (including
its exhibits and schedules, including the Disclosure Schedule) and the
Confidentiality Agreement supersede all prior agreements, and constitute
(together with the other documents and instruments to be executed and
delivered pursuant hereto) a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of
the agreement, between the Parties with respect to its subject matter. There
have been and are no representations, warranties or covenants relating to the
subject matters of this Agreement between the Parties other than those set
forth in this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any person other than the Parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns any right or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement other than (i) the
rights of Indemnified Agents provided in _Section 5.3_ and (ii) as to the
Debt Financing Sources, the provisions of this _Section 11.4_,  _Section
11.5_, _Section 11.6_, _Section 11.7, Section 11.8_, and the second
paragraph of _Section 11.14_ (it being understood that the Debt Financing
Sources shall be third-party beneficiaries of such provisions and that such
provisions may not be amended in a manner adverse to the Debt Financing
Sources in any material respect without their prior written consent).

 

11.5 _Assignment_. Neither Party shall assign, transfer or encumber this
Agreement or its rights or obligations hereunder, whether in whole or in
part, without the prior written consent of the other Party, and any attempted
assignment, transfer or encumbrance without such consent shall be void and
without effect. Subject to the previous sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective permitted successors and permitted assigns.

11.6  _Governing Law and Language_. This Agreement shall be construed and
interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, excluding
any choice of law rules that may direct the application of the Laws of another
jurisdiction.

 

11.7 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party stipulates
that any dispute or disagreement between the Parties as to the interpretation
of any provision of, or the performance of obligations under, this Agreement
or the Debt Financing shall be commenced and prosecuted in its entirety
exclusively in, and consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and proper venue
of, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. Each Party consents
to personal and subject matter jurisdiction and venue in such courts and
waives and relinquishes all right to object to the suitability or convenience
of such venue or forum by reason of their present or future domiciles or by
any other reason. The Parties acknowledge that all directions issued by the
forum court, including all injunctions and other decrees, will be binding and
enforceable in all jurisdictions.

 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the Parties agrees
that it will not bring or support any Action of any kind or description,
whether in Law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise
against the Debt Financing Sources and their respective current, former or
future directors, officers, general or limited partners, stockholders,
members, 

 



59  managers, controlling persons, Affiliates, employees or Advisors in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating any way to the
Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, County of New York or, if under applicable law
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof).

EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND,
THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY
HAS CONSIDERED AND UNDERSTANDS THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY
MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 11.7_.

 

11.8 _Amendment_. No amendments or supplements to this Agreement shall be
valid and binding unless set forth in a written agreement executed and
delivered by Buyer and Parent (or, after the Closing, by Buyer and
Representative).

11.9 _Waiver_. No waiver by a Party of any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument executed
and delivered by the Party so waiving. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance with any
representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement and in
any documents delivered or to be delivered pursuant hereto. The waiver by a
Party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.

11.10 _Notice_. All notices, requests, demands and other communications under
this Agreement shall be given in writing and shall be personally delivered,
sent by electronic transmission or sent by a nationally recognized private
overnight courier service as follows:

62 11.13 _Conflicts; Certain Communications_.

 

(a) _Conflicts; Privilege_. Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(which, for this purpose, shall be deemed to include the Company and its
Subsidiaries) agrees that, notwithstanding any current or prior representation
of the Company and its Subsidiaries by Winston and Strawn LLP, Winston and Strawn
LLP shall be allowed to represent Parent, the Representative and each of
their Affiliates in any matters and disputes adverse to Buyer, the Company,
any Subsidiary of the Company and/or their respective Affiliates that either
are existing on the date hereof or arise in the future and relate to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates (which, for this purpose, shall be deemed to include the
Company and the Subsidiaries) hereby (i) waives any claim that Buyer, the
Company, any Subsidiary of the Company and their respective Affiliates have
or may have that Winston and Strawn LLP has a conflict of interest or is
otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation and (ii) agrees
that, if a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer, the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective Affiliates and Parent,
the Representative or any of their Affiliates, then Winston and Strawn LLP may
represent Parent, the Representative and/or such Affiliates in such dispute
even though the interests of Parent, the Representative and/or such Affiliates
may be directly adverse to Buyer, the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company
and/or their respective Affiliates and even though Winston and Strawn LLP may
have represented the Company and/or any its Subsidiaries in a matter
substantially related to such dispute or may be handling ongoing matters for
Buyer, the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company and/or their respective
Affiliates. Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (which, for this
purpose, shall be deemed to include the Company and its Subsidiaries), agrees
that, as to all communications between or among Winston and Strawn LLP and
Parent, the Representative, the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company and/or
any of their respective Affiliates that relate in any way to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belongs to Parent and/or the Representative,
shall be controlled by Parent and/or the Representative and shall not pass to
or be claimed by Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a dispute arises between Buyer, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and a third party (other than Parent, the
Representative or any of their Affiliates) after the Closing, then the Company
or its Subsidiary, to the extent applicable, may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure to such third party of confidential
communications by Winston and Strawn LLP; provided, however, that neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the
prior written consent of Parent or the Representative. For clarification, as
of Closing, unless specifically retained as to a matter, Winston and Strawn LLP
shall no longer represent the Company and shall comply with the terms of 
_Section 5.4_ for the benefit of the Company and Buyer.

(b) _Certain Communications_. Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(which, for this purpose, shall be deemed to include the Company and its
Subsidiaries) agrees that all communications involving Parent, the
Representative, the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any agent
or representative of any of the

 



63  foregoing with, and work product of, Winston and Strawn LLP as they relate to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, together with all
written or other materials consisting of, containing, summarizing or
embodying such communications and work product (collectively, the " _Protected
Information_ "), are the property of Parent, and after the Closing, Buyer, the
Company, the Subsidiary of the Company or their respective Affiliates shall
keep the Protected Information confidential in accordance with customary
confidentiality procedures.

 

11.14 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may be enforced only against the named
parties hereto. Following the Closing, (a) all claims or causes of action
that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may be made only
against the Persons that are expressly identified as parties hereto and (b)
neither any past, present or future Affiliate nor any past, present or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder,
agent, attorney or representative of Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including the Representative and any Person negotiating or executing this
Agreement on behalf of a party hereto) shall have any liability or obligation
with respect to this Agreement or with respect to any claim or cause of action
that may arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement; provided, however, that this
_Section 11.14_ shall not limit any claims based on fraud, willful breach or
intentional misconduct.

 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties hereto
agrees and acknowledges that Parent, the Representative and (prior to the
Closing) the Company, shall not have any recourse (directly or indirectly),
rights or claims in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing Letter
or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including the Debt
Financing) against any Debt Financing Source in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Debt Financing Letter,
whether by enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable
proceeding, by virtue of any applicable requirements of law or otherwise;
provided, however, that nothing in the preceding sentence shall in any way
limit any liability or obligation of Buyer hereunder.

"hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole and (c) the term "knowledge"
when used in the phrases "to the knowledge of Parent" or "Parent has no

Law shall be deemed to refer to such Law as enacted prior to the Closing Date.
When calculating the period of time before which, within which or following
which any act is required to be done pursuant to this Agreement, the date
that is the reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded and,

this Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding of the Parties. The
language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by
the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against either Party. This Agreement may be
