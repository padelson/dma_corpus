OFFER   SECTION 2.01. The Offer. (a) Provided that this Agreement shall
not  ------------ --------- have been terminated in accordance with Article
IX, unless otherwise agreed by Parent and the Company, no later than three
Business Days following effectiveness of a Registration Statement on Form S-4
(together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Offer Registration
Statement") Parent  ---------------------------- shall cause Merger Sub to
commence an offer (the "Offer") to purchase all of the  ----- outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock at a price for each share of Company Common
Stock of (1) $29.60, net to the seller in cash, and (2) a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. The Offer shall
be subject only to (1) the condition that there shall be validly tendered
in accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to the expiration date of
the Offer and not withdrawn, a number of shares of Company Common Stock
that, together with the shares of Company Common Stock then owned by Parent
and/or Merger Sub, represents at least two-thirds of the shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (the "Minimum Condition")
and (2) the other  ----------------- conditions set forth in Annex I hereto.
Merger Sub shall have the right to waive any of the conditions to the Offer
and to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer; provided
that (A) the Minimum Condition may not be  -------- waived or reduced to
less than two-thirds of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on a
fully-diluted basis without the prior written consent of the Company and (B)
no change may be made that changes the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, decreases the consideration payable in the Offer, reduces the maximum
number of shares of Company Common Stock to be purchased in the Offer,
imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex I or
makes any other change which is adverse to the holders of Company
Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of the
Company, Merger Sub shall have the right to extend the Offer (i) for one or
more periods (not in excess of 10 Business Days each) but in no event ending
later than the Termination Date if, at the scheduled or extended expiration
date of the Offer, any of the conditions to the Offer shall not have been
satisfied or waived, until such conditions are satisfied or waived, (ii) for
any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of
the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer or any period required
by applicable law or (iii) for an aggregate period of not more than 10
Business Days beyond the latest applicable date that would otherwise be
permitted under clause (i) or (ii) of this sentence, if, as of such date, all
of the conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or waived, but the number
of shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant
to the Offer equals 80% or more, but less than 90%, of the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock on a fully diluted basis. In the event that Merger
Sub is unable to consummate the Offer on the initial scheduled expiration
date due to the failure of the conditions to the Offer to be satisfied or
waived, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, unless this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Article IX, extend the Offer and set a subsequent scheduled  
6   expiration date, and shall continue to so extend the Offer and set
subsequent scheduled expiration dates until the Termination Date. Subject to
the foregoing and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer,
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and pay for, as promptly
as practicable after the expiration of the Offer, all shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. Parent
will announce the exact Exchange Ratio with respect to each share of Company
Common Stock that is to be exchanged in the Offer by 9:00 a.m., New York City
time, on the second Trading Day immediately preceding the Acceptance Date.
Parent will make such announcement by issuing a press release to the Dow
Jones News Service.   (b) As soon as reasonably practicable on the date of
commencement of the Offer, Parent shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO"). As soon as reasonably
practicable  ----------- after the date hereof, Parent shall, and shall
cause Merger Sub to, file the Offer Registration Statement (the Schedule TO,
the Offer Registration Statement and such documents included therein pursuant
to which the Offer will be made, the "Offer Documents"). Parent and the
Company agree promptly to correct any  --------------- information provided
by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect.
Parent shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to take all steps necessary
to cause the Schedule TO and the Offer Registration Statement as so corrected
to be filed with the SEC and the other Offer Documents as so corrected to be,
at such time as reasonably agreed by Parent and the Company, disseminated to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its
counsel shall be given an opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents prior to their being filed with the SEC or disseminated to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock. Parent shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments
Parent and Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such
comments and shall provide the Company and its counsel an opportunity to
participate in the response of Parent or Merger Sub to such comments.  
SECTION 2.02. Company Action. (a) The Company hereby approves of and 
------------ -------------- consents to the Offer and represents that its
Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has (i) unanimously
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, are in the best interests of the
Company\'s shareholders, (ii) unanimously approved and adopted this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger,
in accordance with the requirements of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act
(the "VSCA") and (iii) subject to Section 7.07, unanimously  ---- resolved
to recommend acceptance of the Offer and approval of this Agreement by the
Company\'s shareholders. The Company further represents that Morgan Stanley
and Co. Incorporated ("Morgan Stanley") has delivered to the Company\'s Board
of  -------------- Directors its written opinion as of the date hereof that
the consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the terms of the Offer and the Merger is fair from a
financial point of view to such holders. The Company will promptly furnish
Parent with a list of its shareholders, mailing labels and any available
listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all record
holders of shares of Company Common Stock and lists of securities positions
of shares of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories, in each case
true and   7   correct as of the most recent practicable date, and will
provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists of
shareholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such
other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the
Offer.   (b) The Company hereby agrees to file with the SEC
contemporaneously with the commencement of the Offer and disseminate to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws, a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the "Schedule 14D-  ------------ 9") that, subject to Section 7.07,
shall reflect the recommendations of the - Company\'s Board of Directors
referred to in Section 2.02(a) above; provided,  -------- however, that
prior to the Acceptance Date, the Board of Directors of the ------- Company
may amend, modify, withdraw, condition or qualify such recommendations or may
take any action or make any statement inconsistent with such recommendations,
to the extent that the majority of the Company\'s Board of Directors
concludes in its good faith judgment, after receiving the advice of outside
legal counsel, that it is necessary to take such action in order to comply
with its fiduciary duties to shareholders under applicable law. The Company
agrees to provide Parent and its counsel with any comments that the Company
or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall
provide Parent and its counsel with an opportunity to participate in the
response of the Company to such comments. The Company and Parent each agree
promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and
its counsel shall be given an opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule 14D-9 prior to its being filed with the SEC or disseminated to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock.   SECTION 2.03. Directors. (a)
Effective upon the acceptance for  ------------ --------- payment of any
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall be
entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, on the Company\'s Board of Directors that equals the product of
(i) the total number of directors on the Company\'s Board of Directors
(giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this
Section 2.03) and (ii) the percentage that the number of shares of Company
Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent and/or Merger Sub (including shares
of Company Common Stock accepted for payment) bears to the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding, and the Company shall take all
action necessary to cause Parent\'s designees to be elected or appointed to
the Company\'s Board of Directors, including increasing the number of
directors, and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors. At
such time, the Company will also use its best efforts to cause individuals
designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the
next whole number, on (i) each committee of the Board and (ii) each board of
directors of each Subsidiary of the Company identified by Parent (and each
committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as such individuals
represent on the Board of Directors of the Company, in each case only to the
extent permitted by applicable law. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 2.03, the parties hereto shall use their respective best efforts to
ensure that at least two of the members of the Company\'s Board of Directors
shall,   8   at all times prior to the Effective Time, be directors of
the Company who were directors of the Company on the date hereof (the
"Continuing Directors");  -------------------- provided that if there shall
be in office fewer than two Continuing Directors -------- for any reason,
the Company\'s Board of Directors shall cause a person designated by the
remaining Continuing Director to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to be
a Continuing Director for all purposes of this Agreement, or if no
Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors of the Company then in
office shall designate two persons to fill such vacancies who will not be
officers or employees or affiliates of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or
any of their respective Subsidiaries and such persons shall be deemed to be
Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement.   (b) The
Company\'s obligations to appoint Parent\'s designees to the Company\'s Board
of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions,
and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the
Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1 require in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section, so long
as Parent shall have provided to the Company on a timely basis in writing and
be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself, Merger Sub
and their respective nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required
by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.   (c) Following the election or
appointment of Parent\'s designees pursuant to Section 2.03(a) and until the
Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall
be required to authorize any termination of this Agreement by the Company,
any amendment of this Agreement requiring action by the Company\'s Board of
Directors, any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action
hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, any waiver of compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, any
consent or action by the Board of Directors of the Company hereunder and any
other action of the Company hereunder which adversely affects the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or Purchaser).   (d)
Parent shall take such action as shall be necessary so that, at the Effective
Time, the number of directors comprising each class of directors of the Board
of Directors of Parent shall be increased from four to five, and three
individuals from among the present directors of the Company (the "Designated
Directors") who shall be agreed upon by Parent and the Company shall 
-------------------- be appointed to the Board of Directors of Parent to fill
the vacancies created by such newly created directorships having terms
expiring at the Company\'s annual meetings of shareholders to be held in
2001, 2002 and 2003. The Company hereby agrees to provide to Parent as soon
as practicable any information in respect of the Designated Directors as
Parent shall reasonably request.   ARTICLE III   THE MERGER   SECTION

shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in Section 13.1-721 of
the VSCA.   SECTION 3.02. Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation.  ------------
------------------------------------------------------ The Articles of

Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 3.03. By-Laws of the Surviving

RELATED MATTERS   SECTION 4.01. Conversion of Capital Stock. At the
Effective Time, by  ------------ --------------------------- virtue of the
Merger:   (a) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Stock Owned by Parent and 
------------------------------------------------------------ Merger Sub. All
shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company as
treasury ---------- stock and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, no longer be outstanding, shall be
canceled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall
cease to exist.   (b) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of Merger Sub
Common  --------------------------- Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (c) Conversion of Company Common
Stock. Except as provided in clause  ---------------------------------- (a)
of this Section 4.01, each share of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and shall be canceled in exchange for the right to receive from Parent the
same amount of cash and the same number of shares of Parent Common Stock as
paid for each share of Company Common Stock in the Offer. At the Effective
Time, all Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding, shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a
"Certificate") that formerly represented  ----------- such shares of Company
Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive cash and
the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which the Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificate is converted pursuant to this
Section 4.01(c) and the right, if any, to receive pursuant to Section 4.03(e)
cash in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock and any dividend or
distribution pursuant to Section 4.03(c), in each case without interest.  
(d) In the event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to
the Effective Time, the Company changes the number of shares of
Company Common Stock, or Parent changes the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, issued and outstanding as a result of a stock split, stock
combination, stock dividend, recapitalization, redenomination of share
capital or other similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio and other items
dependent thereon shall be appropriately adjusted.   SECTION 4.02. Exchange
of Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent  ------------
------------------ shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the
purposes of exchanging the Certificates for cash and the whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented thereby have been converted and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of
record of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title   11   to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form and
have such other customary provisions as the Surviving Corporation or Parent
may reasonably specify) providing instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates in exchange for cash and the whole number of shares
of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby have been converted and cash in lieu of a fractional
share of Parent Common Stock.   SECTION 4.03. Exchange of Certificates. (a)
Exchange Agent. On  ------------ ------------------------ -------------- or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent
(i) as nominee for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, the
aggregate amount of cash and the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 4.01(c) and (ii) an amount of cash
sufficient to permit the Exchange Agent to make the necessary payments of
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
Section 4.03(e) (such cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, together with
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund"), to be held for the benefit of and
distributed to the holders of Company Common Stock in accordance with this
Section 4.03. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund as directed by the Surviving  ------------- Corporation on a
daily basis in direct obligations of the United States, obligations for which
the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to provide for the
payment of principal and interest, commercial paper rated the highest quality
by Moody\'s Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Ratings Group or
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers\' acceptances
of a commercial bank having at least $100,000,000 in assets, or in money
market funds which are invested in the foregoing; provided that no such 
-------- investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the
Company\'s shareholders pursuant to this Article IV. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall replace any monies lost through an investment made pursuant
to this Section 4.03. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall promptly be paid to the Surviving Corporation.   (b)
Exchange Procedures. Upon surrender of a Certificate for 
------------------- cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with the
letter of transmittal referred to in Section 4.02 duly executed and completed
in accordance with its terms, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the amount of cash and a
certificate or certificates representing the whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Certificate have been converted in accordance with Section 4.01(c), (ii)
the amount of dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date on
or after the Effective Time which theretofore became payable with respect to
such shares of Parent Common Stock, and (iii) the cash amount payable in lieu
of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section
4.03(e), in each case which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
the provisions of this Article IV, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In no event shall the holder of any Certificate be
entitled to receive interest on any funds to be received in the Merger. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the amount of cash
and a certificate or certificates representing that whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Common Stock have been
converted in accordance with Section 4.01(c), plus the cash amount payable in
lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section
4.03(e), may be issued to a   12   transferee if the Certificate
representing such Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.03(b) and subject to
Section 4.03(c), each Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent
for all purposes only the right to receive the amount of cash and the whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock into which the number of shares of
Company Common Stock shown thereon has been converted in accordance with
Section 4.01(c), plus the cash amount payable in lieu of a fractional share
of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 4.03(e). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, certificates representing Company Common Stock surrendered for
exchange by any Person constituting a "Rule 145 Affiliate" of the Company for
purposes of Section 7.14 shall not be exchanged until Parent has received a
Rule 145 Affiliate Agreement (as defined in Section 7.14) as provided in
Section 7.14.   (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or  ------------------------------------------------ other
distributions declared, made or paid after the Effective Time with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date on or after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby and no
cash payment in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 4.03(e) until the holder of
record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance
with this Section. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder
of the certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock, without
interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions, if any, with a record date on or after the Effective Time
which theretofore became payable, but which were not paid by reason of the
immediately preceding sentence, with respect to such shares of Parent Common
Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date on or after the Effective Time but
prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock. Dividends or other
distributions with a record date on or after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender of Certificates by holders thereof payable in respect of shares of
Parent Common Stock held by the Exchange Agent shall be held in trust for the
benefit of such holders of Certificates.   (d) No Further Ownership Rights
in Company Common Stock. All shares 
--------------------------------------------------- of Parent Common Stock
issued and all cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section
4.03(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued at the Effective Time in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
represented thereby, subject to the Surviving Corporation\'s obligation to
pay any dividends which may have been declared by the Company on the shares
of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
which remained unpaid at the Effective Time. From and after the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall
be no further registration of transfers thereon of the shares of Company
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Section 4.03.   13    (e) No Fractional Shares. No
certificate or scrip representing  -------------------- fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock will be issued in the Offer or the Merger upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a
holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. In lieu of any such fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock, each holder of Certificates who
would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock in exchange for such Certificates (after taking into account all
Certificates delivered by such holder) pursuant to this Section 4.03 shall
receive from the Exchange Agent, as applicable, a cash payment in lieu of
such fractional share of Parent Common Stock, determined by multiplying (i)
the Average Price by (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder would otherwise be entitled.   (f) Termination of
Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund 
---------------------------- which remains undistributed to the shareholders
of the Company for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to or
as directed by Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have
not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of their claim for shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash
in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock. Neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of any
Certificate for cash or shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto), or cash payable in respect of a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock, delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any
securities or cash amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of
Certificates five years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any governmental entity) shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.   (g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate
shall  -------------------------------------- have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the cash and the whole number
of shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented thereby have been converted, any cash in lieu of a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock, and unpaid dividends
and distributions in respect of or on shares of Parent Common Stock
deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.   (h)
Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent 
------------------ shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the cash and
the shares of Parent Common Stock (and any dividends or distributions
thereon) and cash in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock
otherwise payable hereunder to any holder of Certificates in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign income tax
law. To the extent that the Surviving Corporation or Parent so withholds
those amounts, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this   14   Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.   SECTION 4.04. Stock
Options and Other Stock Plans.  ------------
-----------------------------------   (a) Company Options. Not less than
five Business Days prior to the  --------------- date on which Merger Sub
accepts for payment all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the "Acceptance Date") 
--------------- each holder of a Company Option shall have the right to elect
either of the following alternatives with respect to such Company Options by
delivering a written election to the Company: (i) that their options be
cashed out, in whole or in part, in the manner described below (the "Cashout
Election") or (ii) that  ---------------- their options be exchanged, in
whole or in part, for options to purchase Parent Common Stock in the manner
described below (the "Conversion Election"). In the 
------------------- event that any holder of a Company Option does not make
an election as provided for in this Section 4.04(a), such holder shall be
deemed to have made a Cashout Election with respect to such holder\'s Company
Options.   (b) In the event an optionee elects the Cashout Election, on
the Acceptance Date the Company shall terminate or cancel all Company Options
to which the Cashout Election relates that are outstanding and unexercised as
of such date as set forth in Section 4.04 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
Each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised on the Acceptance
Date as to which the holder thereof has made a Cashout Election shall be
cancelled on the Acceptance Date, and the holder thereof shall receive in
exchange for the cancellation of such Company Option, an amount in cash equal
to (i) the excess, if any, of (1) the Per Share Amount over (2) the per share
exercise price of such Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of the
Acceptance Date. Any such payment shall be subject to all applicable federal,
state and local tax employee withholding requirements. In the event that an
optionee elects the Cashout Election with respect to a portion of the Company
Options held thereby, the remaining Company Options held by such optionee
shall be exchanged for options of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section
4.04(c).   (c) In the event an optionee elects the Conversion Election,
prior to the Effective Time Parent and the Company shall take such action as
may be necessary to cause each Company Option to which the Conversion
Election relates to be automatically converted at the Effective Time into an
option ("Substituted  ----------- Option") to purchase a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the ------ product of (i) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock that could have been purchased (assuming full
vesting) under such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (ii) the quotient of (1) the Per Share Amount divided by (2)
the Average Price (rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent\'s Common Stock), at a price per share of Parent\'s Common Stock equal
to the quotient of (x) the per-share option exercise price specified in the
Company Option divided by (y) (1) the Per Share Amount divided by (2)
the Average Price (rounded down to the nearest whole cent). Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, such Substituted Option shall be
subject to the same terms and conditions as such Company Option. Such
Substituted Options shall be subject to any other rights which arise under
the Company Employee Benefit Plans, the option agreements  
15   evidencing awards thereunder as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise, including the full vesting of
such Company Options to the extent provided in such plans or agreements. As
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
issue to each holder of an outstanding Company Option a document evidencing
the foregoing assumption by Parent. In the event that an optionee elects the
Conversion Election with respect to a portion of the Company Options held
thereby, the remaining Company Options held by such optionee shall be cashed-
out pursuant to Section 4.04(b).   (d) In respect of each Substituted Option
and the shares of Parent Common Stock underlying such option, Parent shall
file as promptly as practicable, and in no event later than the second
Business Day after the Closing Date, and keep current, a Form S-8 or other
appropriate registration statement for as long as any Substituted Options
remain outstanding. In connection with the issuance of Substituted Options,
Parent shall, by action of the Board of Directors of Parent, reserve for
issuance the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will become subject
to Substituted Options pursuant to this Section 4.04.   (e) Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take such steps reasonably necessary,
including amendment of the plans and agreements governing the terms of the
Company Options, to accomplish the disposition of the Company Options
pursuant to this Section 4.04, including the Cashout Election and
the Conversion Election. In addition, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall amend each outstanding Company Option to provide that in the
event the option holder\'s employment is involuntarily terminated following
the Acceptance Date other than for cause or in the event that an employee
terminates his or her employment for "good reason" as such term is defined in
such employee\'s employment agreement, the exercise period for such option
shall end on the three year anniversary of the Acceptance Date or the last
day of the original term of the Company Option, whichever occurs first.  
(f) Phantom Share Units and Restricted Stock. On the Acceptance Date, 
---------------------------------------- the Company shall terminate or
cancel all performance shares and restricted or performance share units and,
to the extent provided for in the award agreement, all restricted stock, and
each holder of such stock or units that are outstanding, whether or not such
stock or units are free of restrictions, shall be entitled to receive on the
Acceptance Date, in exchange for the cancellation of such stock or units, an
amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the mean of the high and low sales
price on the Acceptance Date of Company Common Stock and (2) the number of
shares or units subject to such award. Any such payment shall be subject to
all applicable federal, state and local tax employee withholding
requirements.   ARTICLE V   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY   Except as disclosed in the Company\'s disclosure schedule
delivered concurrently with the delivery of this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure  ------------------ Schedule"), the Company hereby represents and

the concept of good standing) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation and each such Person has all requisite corporate, partnership
or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the failure to
be so organized, existing and in good standing or to have such power and
authority could not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each
of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or

individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Other than as set forth in Section 5.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the respective Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws or other organizational
documents of the Significant Subsidiaries of the Company do not contain any
provision limiting or otherwise restricting the ability of the Company to

Company will provide Parent with a list of all Subsidiaries of the Company
and their respective jurisdictions of incorporation or organization which

executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and binding obligation
of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,

relating to shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the Company
or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, pursuant to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is or may become obligated to issue shares of its capital
stock or other equity interests or any securities convertible into,

Other than as set forth in Section 6.01 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
the respective Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws or other organizational

Proxy  ------------
------------------------------------------------- Statement/Prospectus. (a)
Company Shareholder Meeting. If required by -------------------- applicable
law, the Company, acting through its Board of Directors, shall, in accordance
with applicable law, duly call, convene and hold a special meeting of the
holders of the Company Common Stock (the "Company Shareholder Meeting") as 
--------------------------- soon as reasonably practicable after the
acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer for the purpose of voting upon this Agreement and the Merger and the
Company agrees that this Agreement shall be submitted at such meeting. The
Company shall take all action necessary to secure the vote of shareholders
required by applicable law and the Company\'s Article of Incorporation or By-
Laws to obtain the approval for this Agreement. Unless the Board of Directors
of the Company otherwise determines (based upon a majority vote of the Board
of Directors in its good faith judgment that such other action is necessary
to comply with its fiduciary duty to shareholders under applicable law after
receiving advice from outside legal counsel) prior to the approval by the
shareholders of the Company, (i) the Company\'s Board of Directors
shall recommend approval by its shareholders of this Agreement (the
"Company  ------- Recommendation"), (ii) neither the Company\'s Board of
Directors nor any -------------- committee thereof shall amend, modify,
withdraw, condition or qualify the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse
to Parent or take any   39   action or make any statement inconsistent
with the Company Recommendation and (iii) the Company shall take all lawful
action to secure the Company Shareholder Approval.   (b) Preparation of
Merger Registration Statement and Proxy 
------------------------------------------------------ Statement/Prospectus.
If required by applicable law, promptly after
the -------------------- acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer, Parent and the Company shall prepare, and Parent
shall file with the SEC, the Merger Registration Statement, in which the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as Parent\'s prospectus. Each of
the Company and Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to have the Merger
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after the acceptance for payment of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and to keep the Merger Registration
Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. The
Company shall mail the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to its shareholders as
promptly as practicable after the Merger Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act and, if necessary, after the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall have been so mailed, promptly circulate amended,
supplemental or supplemented proxy material, and, if required in connection
therewith, resolicit proxies. Parent shall take any action required to be
taken under any applicable state securities or blue sky laws in
connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger. No
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by the
Company or Parent without the approval of the other party, which will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each party will advise the other party,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Merger
Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment
has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Proxy Statement/ Prospectus or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If at
any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company or Parent discovers any
information relating to either party, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that such document would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by law or regulation, disseminated
to the shareholders of the Company.   (c) Short-Form Merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent or  ----------------- Merger Sub
shall acquire at least 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, the parties hereto agree, subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted hereunder) waiver of all conditions
to the Merger, to take, or cause to be taken, all necessary and appropriate
action to cause the Merger to be effective as soon as practicable after the
acceptance for payment and purchase of shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer without the Company Shareholder Meeting.  
SECTION 7.06. Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to Section 7.09 and 
------------ ----------------------- the terms and conditions
provided herein, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all   40   appropriate action, and to make,
or cause to be made, all filings necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement including, without limitation,
the Company\'s and Parent\'s reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to the
Closing Date, all licenses, permits, consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities (other
than with respect to any licenses, permits, consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and orders of any Antitrust Authority which
the Company and Parent shall use their best efforts to obtain) and parties to
contracts with the Company or Parent, as the case may be, and their
respective Subsidiaries as are necessary for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and in order to comply with applicable Laws;
provided however, that except as otherwise  -------- ------- contemplated by
this Agreement, no material loan agreement or contract for borrowed money
shall be repaid except as currently required by its terms, in whole or in
part, and no contract shall be amended to materially increase the amount
payable thereunder or otherwise to be more burdensome to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in order to obtain any such consent, approval
or authorization without first obtaining the written approval of Parent.  
SECTION 7.07. No Solicitation. (a) The Company shall, and shall use 
------------ --------------- its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Subsidiaries, and its and their, officers, directors, employees, financial
advisors, attorneys and other advisors, representatives and agents
(collectively, "Representatives") to,  --------------- immediately cease any
discussions or negotiations with third parties with respect to any Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its
Representatives, to (i) directly or indirectly solicit, facilitate, initiate
or encourage the making or submission of, any Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter
into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to any Takeover
Proposal or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring
it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) initiate or participate in
any way in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish or disclose
to any Person (other than a party to this Agreement) any information with
respect to, or take any other action to facilitate or in furtherance of any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal or (iv) grant any waiver or
release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class
of the Company\'s equity securities; provided that prior to the acceptance 
-------- for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer,
in response to an unsolicited Takeover Proposal that did not result from the
breach of this Section 7.07 and following delivery to Parent of notice of the
Takeover Proposal in compliance with its obligations under Section 7.07(d)
hereof, the Company may participate in discussions or negotiations with or
furnish information (pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with customary
terms) to any third party which makes a bona fide written Takeover Proposal
if (A) a majority of the Company\'s Board of Directors reasonably determines
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors) that taking
such action would be reasonably likely to lead to the delivery to the Company
of a Superior Proposal and (B) a majority of the Company\'s Board of
Directors determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of outside
legal counsel) that it is necessary to take such actions(s) in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.   For purposes of
this Agreement, "Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, 
----------------- proposal or offer from any Person or group relating to (i)
any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of the assets
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or 20% or more   41   of any
class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any
Person beneficially owning all or any portion of any class of
equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) any
merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of all or any substantial
portion of the assets, recapitalization, liquidation or a dissolution of, or
similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other
than the Offer or the Merger; and "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide
written Takeover  ----------------- Proposal made by a third party to
purchase at least two-thirds of the outstanding equity securities of the
Company pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or any merger,
consolidation, business combination or sale of all or substantially all of
the assets, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company (i)
on terms which a majority of the Company\'s Board of Directors determines in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors) to be superior to
the Company and its shareholders (in their capacity as shareholders) from a
financial point of view (taking into account, among other things, all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and identity of the
offeror) as compared to the transactions contemplated hereby and any
alternative proposed by Parent or Merger Sub in accordance with
Section 9.01(c) and (ii) which is reasonably capable of being
consummated.   (b) The Company agrees that, except as set forth in Section
7.07(c), neither its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i)
approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Takeover
Proposal or (ii) approve, recommend or cause it to enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") related to any Takeover
Proposal.  ---------------------   (c) The Company and Parent agree that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the acceptance for
payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, the Company
and/or its Board of Directors may take the actions otherwise prohibited by
Section 7.07(b) if (i) a third party makes a Superior Proposal, (ii) the
Company complies with its obligations under Section 7.07(d), (iii) all of the
conditions to the Company\'s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with Section 9.01(c) hereof have been satisfied (including the expiration of
the six Business Day period described therein and the payment of all amounts
required pursuant to Section 9.03 hereof) and (iv) simultaneously therewith,
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 9.01(c) hereof.  
(d) The Company agrees that in addition to the obligations of the Company set
forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 7.07, promptly on the
date of receipt thereof, the Company shall advise Parent in writing of any
request for information or any Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry, discussions
or negotiations with respect to any Takeover Proposal and the terms and
conditions of such request, Takeover Proposal, inquiry, discussions
or negotiations and the Company shall promptly provide to Parent copies of
any written materials received by the Company in connection with any of
the foregoing, and the identity of the Person or group making any such
request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry or with whom any discussions or
negotiations are taking place. The Company agrees that it shall keep Parent
fully informed of the status and details (including amendments or proposed
amendments) of any such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry and keep Parent
fully informed as to the material details of any information requested of or
provided by the Company and as to the details of all discussions or
negotiations with respect to any such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry.
The Company agrees that it shall simultaneously provide to Parent any non-
public information concerning the   42   Company provided to any other
Person or group in connection with any Takeover Proposal which was not
previously provided to Parent.   (e) Parent agrees that nothing contained in
this Section 7.07 shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to

The Company agrees that immediately following the execution of this
Agreement, (i) it shall request each Person which has heretofore executed
a confidentiality agreement in connection with such Person\'s consideration
of acquiring the Company to return or destroy (which destruction shall be
certified in writing by an executive officer of the Company) all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on its behalf and (ii)
the Company shall cease and cause to be terminated immediately all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover
Proposal.   SECTION 7.08. Notification of Certain Matters. The Company
shall  ------------ ------------------------------- give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent shall, and shall cause Merger Sub to, give prompt notice
to the Company, of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which
occurrence or failure to occur would be likely to cause any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue in any material respect at
any time from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time. Each of the
Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other party of any notice
or other communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such
third party is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 7.09. Antitrust Laws. (a) Parent
and the Company shall  ------------ -------------- together discuss and
formulate the approach to be taken with respect to Antitrust Authorities;
provided, however, that Parent shall have the right to  --------
------- determine the overall strategy with respect to any filings,
submissions of information or documentary materials to, proceedings or
negotiations with, or any other discussions, meetings, consultations,
conversations or interactions with (collectively, "Contacts"), any Antitrust
Authority. Without limiting the  -------- generality of the foregoing, but
subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, prior to any Contacts with
any Antitrust Authority by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent and the Company shall each have
the right to (i) in the case of filings, submissions of information or
documentary materials, review such Contacts prepared by the other party and
comment with respect thereto and the other party shall be required
to incorporate into such Contacts all reasonable comments of Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, and (ii) discuss prior to any Contacts the
appropriate approach to be taken with respect thereto. As part of its overall
strategy, Parent shall determine the timing of any Contacts with any
Antitrust Authority and Parent shall be entitled to act as the spokesperson
in connection therewith; provided that, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, Parent -------- shall afford the Company a
reasonable opportunity to participate in any such Contacts; provided further,
that the Company shall not initiate any material  -------- ------- Contacts
with any Antitrust Authority or any other Governmental Authority regarding
any of the transactions contemplated hereby without Parent\'s prior consent,
it being understood that the Company may respond to any such Contacts or
requests for Contacts which are initiated by any Antitrust Authority or
any Governmental Authority, or as otherwise required by applicable Law. The
parties hereto agree to provide to   43   each other copies of all
correspondence between it (or its advisors) and any Antitrust Authority
relating to this Agreement or any of the matters described in this Section
7.09.   (b) Each party hereto shall use its best efforts to resolve
such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the

the other transactions contemplated hereby, including,  without limitation,
promptly appealing any adverse court Order.   (ii) in the case of Parent

the Company to agree or commit to  divest, hold separate or offer for sale
any assets (tangible or intangible)  or any business interest of it or any of
its Subsidiaries (including,  without limitation, the Surviving Corporation
after consummation of the  Merger) as are necessary to permit Parent and
Merger Sub to otherwise fully  consummate the Offer and the Merger (a
"Consent Decree"); provided, that  -------------- --------  nothing in this
Agreement shall require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries  to comply with or
accept any Consent Decree which, if complied with, would,  in Parent\'s
reasonable judgment, be expected to have a material adverse  effect on the
business, results of operations or financial condition of  Parent, the
Company and their Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving  effect to the
Offer and the Merger.   For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Antitrust

44   respect to indemnification and exculpation from liability
substantially as set forth in the Company\'s Articles of Incorporation and
By-Laws on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective
Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
individuals who on or prior to the Effective Time were directors, officers,
employees or agents of the Company, unless such modification is required by
law.   (b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall either (i) maintain in effect the Company\'s
current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance covering those Persons
who are currently covered on the date of this Agreement by the Company\'s
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy (a copy of which has
been heretofore delivered to Parent) (the "Indemnified Parties"); provided,
however, that in no event shall  ------------------- -------- ------- Parent
be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 200% of
the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance;
provided  -------- further that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount; provided  -------- further that the Surviving Corporation may
substitute for the Company policy policies with at least the same coverage
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous and provided
that said substitution does not result in any gaps or lapses in coverage with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time or (ii) if such
insurance coverage is not otherwise available, cause Parent\'s directors\'
and officers\' liability insurance then in effect to cover those Persons who
are covered on the date of this Agreement by the Company\'s directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance policy with respect to those matters covered
by the Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability policy.   (c) The
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify all Indemnified Parties to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law with respect to all acts and omissions
arising out of such individuals\' services as officers, directors, employees
or agents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or as trustees
or fiduciaries of any plan for the benefit of employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries occurring prior to the Effective Time, including,
without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limitation of the foregoing, in the event any such Indemnified Party is or
becomes involved in any capacity in any action, proceeding or investigation
in connection with any matter, including, without limitation, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, occurring prior to, and
including, the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, from and after the
Effective Time, shall pay, as incurred, such Indemnified Party\'s reasonable
legal and other expenses (including the cost of any investigation and
preparation) incurred in connection therewith; provided,  -------- that any
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced shall, prior to receiving any
such advance, if required by applicable law, provide Parent with an
undertaking to repay such advance, in full, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after it is ultimately determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder. Subject to
Section 7.10(d) below, the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable
expenses, including attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified
Party in enforcing this Section 7.10 or any action which is indemnifiable
hereunder.   (d) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under paragraph (a) or (c) of this Section 7.10, upon learning of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the
Surviving Corporation thereof. In the   45   event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after
the Effective Time), (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right, from
and after the Effective Time, to assume the defense thereof (with counsel
engaged by the Surviving Corporation to be reasonably acceptable to the
relevant Indemnified Party) and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable
to such Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or
any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof, (ii) such Indemnified Party will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent; provided  -------- that the Surviving Corporation shall not
have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party
in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law.  
SECTION 7.11. Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall 
------------ -------------------- consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such

and review by the other party of such release or statement, except as may be
required by law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with a national securities exchange.   SECTION 7.12. Transfer
Tax. The Company and Parent shall  ------------ ------------ cooperate in
the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,

-------------- expressly shall not be a liability of any holder of the
Company Common Stock.   SECTION 7.13. NYSE Listing. Parent shall use its
best efforts  ------------ ------------ to cause the Parent Common Stock to
be issued in connection with the Offer and the Merger to be listed on the
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.   SECTION 7.14. Affiliates of
the Company. Not less than 15 days  ------------

deliver to Parent a letter identifying all Persons who, to the Company\'s
knowledge, at the Effective Time, may be deemed to be "affiliates" of the
Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act or who may
otherwise be deemed to be Affiliates of the Company (the "Rule 145
Affiliate"). The Company shall use its reasonable best 
------------------ efforts to cause each Person who is identified as a Rule
145 Affiliate in such list to deliver to Parent prior to the Effective Time,
a written agreement, in customary form (a "Rule 145 Affiliate Agreement"). 
----------------------------   SECTION 7.15. Section 16 Matters. Prior to
the Effective Time,  ------------ ------------------ Parent and the Company

Stock) and acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) by each individual  
46   who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.  
SECTION 7.16. Employee Benefits. (a) From and after the  ------------
----------------- Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
honor all Company Employee Benefit Plans and compensation arrangements and
agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the
Effective Time, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be
permitted by such terms. For a period of not less than one year following the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to current and
former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are not collectively
bargained employees (the "Company Employees") compensation and employees
benefits that are, in the  ----------------- aggregate for all Company taken
as a whole (and not on an individual basis) not less favorable than those
provided to Company Employees under the material Company Employee Benefit
Plans immediately before the Effective Time. The foregoing shall not be
construed to prevent the termination of employment of any Company Employee or
the amendment or termination of any particular Company Employee Benefit Plan
or compensation arrangement to the extent permitted by its terms as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time, nor shall it be construed to require
the provision or continuation of any compensation or benefit to any Company
Employee not otherwise entitled by virtue of his employment status or terms
of a relevant Company Benefit Plan. From and after the Acceptance Date,
Parent will cause the Company to comply with this covenant.   (b) For all
purposes under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Affiliates
providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the
"New Plans"), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her 
--------- years of service with the Company and its Affiliates before the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Company Employee Benefit Plans, provided, that the foregoing shall not apply
to the extent that is application would result in a duplication of benefits
or for newly established plans and programs for which prior service of Parent
employees is not taken into account. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans
to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a
comparable Company employee benefit plan or compensation arrangement or
agreements in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the
transfer to the New Plan (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); and
(ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing  --------- medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall
cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
of such New Plan to be waived for each employee who, at the time of transfer
to such New Plan, is participating in an Old Plan providing such benefit and
his or her covered dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
employee\'s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken
into account under such New Plan for purposes for satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.   47    (c)
For so long after the Effective Time as the Company maintains the cash or
deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code in which
Company Employees participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, (the
"401(k)  ------ Plan"), and Parent maintains a 401(k) plan with a loan
feature for similarly ---- situated employees, Parent shall cause the 401(k)
Plan to retain the loan feature of such plan.   (d) For a period of at
least one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain a
severance plan which provides substantially similar benefits as the
Company\'s Salary Continuation Plan (as in effect at the Effective Time), but
which allows the payment of severance benefits in a lump sum at Parent\'s
discretion, and allows the payment by Parent of COBRA premiums for the salary
continuation period in lieu of continued participation in any active medical
plan.   (e) In addition, Parent acknowledges that the other actions
described in Section 7.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule have been or
shall be taken.   SECTION 7.17. Voting of Shares. Parent agrees to vote all
shares of  ------------ ---------------- Company Common Stock beneficially
owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of adoption of this Agreement
at the Company Shareholder Meeting.   SECTION 7.18. The Company Rights Plan.
Prior to the Effective Time,  ------------ ----------------------- the
Company shall take all necessary action to (i) amend the Rights Agreement
so as to accelerate the Final Expiration Date (as such term is used in the
Rights Agreement) to a date which is immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (ii) ensure that after such acceleration (A) none of the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub shall have any obligations under the Company Rights or Rights
Agreement and (B) none of the holders of the Rights shall have any rights
under the Rights or Rights Agreement.   SECTION 7.19. Fees and Expenses.
Whether or not the Offer or the  ------------ ----------------- Merger is
consummated, all expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses, except expenses incurred in connection with the filing,
printing and mailing of the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy
Statement, which shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company.  
SECTION 7.20. Merger Sub. (a) As soon as practicable after the  ------------
---------- date hereof, Parent shall form, or cause to be formed, Merger Sub
and shall cause Merger Sub to execute this Agreement.   (b) Merger Sub will
be formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and will have no Subsidiaries and will undertake no
business or activities other than in connection with this Agreement and
engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby.   (c) Parent will take all
action necessary to cause Merger Sub to take all actions required of it under
this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.   48    ARTICLE VIII  
CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER   SECTION 8.01. Conditions to Obligations of Each

hereto from any liability for any breach of this Agreement.   SECTION 9.03.
Payment of Certain Fees. (a) If this Agreement is

this Agreement and prior to the Termination Date, and concurrently with or
within twelve months of the date of such termination a Third Party

Fee, the "Fees"). The Reverse Termination  ---- Fee shall be the exclusive
remedy of the Company with respect to such termination; provided, however,
that nothing herein shall relieve any party from  -------- ------- liability
for the willful breach of any of its representations and warranties or the
breach of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.  
(d) Any payment of Fees pursuant to this Section 9.03 shall be made within
five Business Days after termination of this Agreement (or as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. If either party fails to pay or reimburse the
other party for any Fees due hereunder, such party shall pay the costs and
expenses (including legal fees and expenses) in connection with any action,
including the filing of any lawsuits or other legal action, taken to collect
payment, together with interest on the amount of any unpaid and unreimbursed
Fees at the publicly announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date
