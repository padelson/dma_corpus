         Time.

(4)      Vivendi and Canal shall use their respective best efforts to obtain the
         approval of the NYSE or NASDAQ, as applicable, for the listing of the
         Vivendi ADRs and the Vivendi ADSs, such listing to be effective as of
         the time of issuance of the Vivendi ADSs, whether pursuant to the

(6)      Seagram and Vivendi shall take all such steps as may be required to
         cause the transactions contemplated by Article 2 and any other
         dispositions of Seagram equity securities and/or acquisitions of
         Vivendi equity securities (including, in each case derivative
         securities) in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
         contemplated hereby by any individual who is a director or officer of
         Seagram, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
         Act.

SECTION 2.9       PREPARATION OF FILINGS, ETC.

         circulars, filings, consents, Regulatory Approvals and other approvals
         and other matters in connection with this Agreement and the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Vivendi, Canal and
         Seagram shall use its reasonable best efforts to have its Circular
         cleared by the SEC and/or each other applicable Government Entity and
         the Form F-4 declared effective by the SEC and to keep the Form F-4

         contemplated hereby. Each of Vivendi, Canal and Seagram shall, as
         promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other
         parties copies of any written comments and advise the other party of
         any oral comments with respect to its Circular or the Form F-4 received
         from the SEC or any other Governmental Entity. The parties shall
         cooperate and provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to review
         and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Circulars and the
         Form F-4 prior to filing such with the SEC and/or each other applicable
         Government Entity, and will provide each other with a copy of all such
         filings made. Each party will advise the other parties, promptly after
         it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form F-4 has become
         effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
         qualification of any of the Vivendi Securities for offering or sale in
         any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC or any other Governmental
         Entity for amendment of the Circulars or the Form F-4.

(2)      Each of Vivendi, Canal and Seagram shall furnish to the other all such
         information concerning it and its shareholders as may be required (and,
         in the case of its shareholders, available to it) for the effectuation
         of the actions described in Sections 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 and the
         foregoing provisions of this Section 2.9, and each covenants that no
         information furnished by it (to its knowledge in the case of
         information concerning its shareholders) in connection with such
         actions or otherwise in connection with the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement will contain any untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
         to be stated in any such document or necessary in order to make any
         information so furnished for use in any such document not misleading in
         the light of the circumstances in which it is furnished.

         efforts to cooperate in the preparation of the Seagram Circular, the
         Canal Circular and the Vivendi Circular and shall cause the same to be
         distributed to shareholders of Vivendi, Canal or Seagram, as
         applicable, and/or filed with the relevant securities regulatory
         authorities and/or stock exchanges.

         application for an order or any other document described in Section 2.8
         contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
         material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
         statements contained therein not misleading in light of the
         circumstances in which they are made, or that otherwise requires an
         amendment or supplement to the Seagram Circular, the Canal Circular or
         the Vivendi Circular or such application or other document. In any such
         event, Vivendi, Canal and Seagram shall use their respective reasonable
         best efforts to cooperate in the preparation of a supplement or
         amendment to the Seagram Circular, the Canal Circular or the Vivendi
         Circular or such application or other document, as required and as the
         case may be, and, if required, shall cause the same to be distributed

         material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
         therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein not
         misleading in light of the circumstances in which they are made (other
         than with respect to any information relating to and provided by a
         Vivendi Party, Canal or any third party that is not an affiliate of
         Seagram) and each of Vivendi and Canal shall provide all information
         regarding it and the Vivendi Securities necessary to do so.

(5)      Vivendi shall ensure that the Vivendi Circular and that the Form F-4
         and Form S-8 comply with all applicable Laws and, without limiting the
         generality of the foregoing, that the Vivendi Circular and such
         documents do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
         omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
         necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading in
         light of the circumstances in which they are made (other than with
         respect to any information relating to and provided by Seagram or any
         third party that is not an affiliate of Vivendi), and Seagram shall
         provide all information regarding it necessary to do so.

(6)      Canal shall ensure that the Canal Circular complies with all applicable

         Seagram shall provide all information regarding it necessary to do so.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

SECTION 3.1       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SEAGRAM.

         Except as Publicly Disclosed by Seagram or as set forth in the Seagram
Disclosure Letter, Seagram represents and warrants to and in favour of the
Vivendi Parties and Canal as follows and acknowledges that the Vivendi Parties
and Canal are relying upon such representations and warranties in connection
with the matters contemplated by this Agreement:

         (a)      Organization.

                  (i)      Each of Seagram and the Seagram Material Subsidiaries
                           has been duly incorporated or formed under all
                           applicable Laws, is validly subsisting and has full
                           corporate or legal power and authority to own its
                           properties and conduct its businesses as currently
                           owned and conducted, except, in the case of the
                           Seagram Material Subsidiaries, where the failure to
                           be so incorporated or formed or subsisting or to have
                           such power and authority would not, individually or
                           in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
                           Seagram. All of the outstanding shares and other
                           ownership interests of the Seagram Material
                           Subsidiaries which are held directly or

                           Agreement, the Option Agreement (other than the
                           approval of the TSE), the Exchange Trust Agreement
                           and the Support Agreement or the consummation by

                           declarations or filings of or with a Governmental
                           Entity which have been set forth in the Seagram
                           Disclosure Letter, or which, if not obtained, would

                           Material Adverse Effect on Seagram.

                  relating to Seagram, neither Seagram nor any of its
                  subsidiaries is in default under, and there exists no event,
                  condition or occurrence which, after notice or lapse of time
                  or both, would constitute such a default under, any contract,
                  agreement, license or franchise to which it is a party which
                  would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
                  Adverse Effect on Seagram.

         (e)      Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since June 30, 1999
                  through to the date hereof, each of Seagram and each Seagram
                  Material Subsidiary has conducted its business only in the
                  ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
                  (except in connection with the transactions contemplated in
                  this Agreement) and there has not occurred a Material Adverse
                  Change with respect to Seagram (which has not been cured).

                  principles ("U.S. GAAP") (subject, in the case of such
                  unaudited financial statements, to the absence of notes and to
                  customary year-end adjustments that are not expected to be
                  material in amount); such financial statements present fairly,
                  in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
                  and results of operations and cash flows of Seagram and its
                  subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the
                  respective periods covered thereby, subject, in the case of
                  such unaudited financial statements, to customary year-end
                  adjustments that are not expected to be material in amount.
                  Except as Publicly Disclosed by Seagram (including on the most
                  recent consolidated balance sheet and the footnotes thereto
                  included in the Seagram Documents Publicly Disclosed by
                  Seagram), Seagram and its subsidiaries have not incurred any
                  liabilities that are of a nature that would be required to be
                  disclosed

                  4.3(a) hereof, (iii) liabilities for Taxes and (iv)
                  liabilities that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
                  have a Material Adverse Effect on Seagram.

         (g)      Litigation, etc.  As of the date of this Agreement, there is
                  no claim, action, proceeding or suit pending or, to the
                  knowledge of Seagram, threatened against Seagram or any
                  Seagram Material Subsidiary before any court or Governmental
                  Entity that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a
                  Material Adverse Effect on Seagram. Neither Seagram nor any
                  Seagram Material Subsidiary, nor any of their respective
                  assets and properties, is subject to any outstanding judgment,
                  order, writ, injunction or decree that would, individually or
                  in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Seagram.

         (h)      Environmental. Except for any matters that would not,
                  individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
                  Effect on Seagram:

                  (i)      all operations of Seagram and the Seagram Material

                                    reasonably be expected to require any
                                    material work, repairs, construction, change
                                    in business practices or operations, or
                                    expenditures;

                           (B)      any written demand or written notice with
                                    respect to a breach of or liability under
                                    any Environmental Laws applicable to Seagram
                                    or any subsidiary; or

                           (C)      any changes in the terms or conditions of
                                    any permits, authorizations, certificates,
                                    registrations, approvals or consents
                                    necessary under Environmental Laws for
                                    Seagram and its Material Subsidiaries to
                                    own, lease or operate their properties or to
                                    conduct their respective businesses as they
                                    are now being conducted (collectively,
                                    "ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS") or any renewal,
                                    modification, revocation, reissuance,

                                    approval of, any Governmental Entity of such
                                    Environmental Permits that are required in

                                    delivery of this Agreement, the consummation
                                    of the transactions contemplated hereby or
                                    the continuation of business of Seagram or
                                    any subsidiaries following such
                                    consummation; and

                  (iii)    to the knowledge of Seagram, there is no reasonable
                           basis for any claim against Seagram or any of its
                           current or former subsidiaries or any of their
                           respective predecessor entities, divisions, or any
                           formerly owned, leased, or operated properties or
                           assets of the foregoing, under any Environmental Laws
                           or with respect to any Hazardous Substances.

         (i)      Tax Matters.

                  (i)      Seagram and each of its subsidiaries have timely
                           filed, or caused to be timely filed, all Tax Returns
                           required to be filed by them, and have timely paid,
                           or caused to be timely paid, all material amounts of
                           Taxes due and payable by them, except for any such
                           failure to file or failure to pay which would not,
                           individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
                           Adverse Effect on Seagram.

                  (ii)     Neither Seagram nor any of its subsidiaries has
                           received any written notification that any issues
                           involving a material amount of Taxes have been raised
                           (and are currently pending) by the Canada Customs and
                           Revenue Agency, the United States Internal Revenue
                           Service or any other taxing authority, including,
                           without limitation, any sales tax authority, in
                           connection with any of the Tax Returns filed or
                           required to be filed, which would, individually or in
                           the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
                           Seagram. Neither Seagram nor any of its subsidiaries
                           has taken any action, or failed to take any action,
                           or has knowledge of any fact, agreement, plan or
                           other circumstance that is reasonably likely to
                           prevent the Arrangement and the Vivendi/Canal
                           Transactions from constituting a transaction
                           described in Section 351 of the Code.

                  pursuant to which Seagram or any of its subsidiaries has any

            (ii)  With respect to each Seagram Plan, no liability has been
                  incurred and there exists no condition or circumstances in
                  connection with which Seagram or any of its subsidiaries could
                  be subject to any liability that would, individually or in the
                  aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Seagram, in each

                  Seagram or any of its subsidiaries, except where such dispute,
                  strike or work stoppage would not, individually or in the
                  aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Seagram.

      (k)   Reports. Seagram has filed with the OSC, TSE, SEC and with the NYSE

            statements and other documents required to be filed by it since July
            1, 1998 (such forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
            documents, including any financial statements or other documents,
            including any schedules included therein, are referred to as the
            "SEAGRAM DOCUMENTS"). The Seagram Documents at the time filed (i)
            did not contain any misrepresentation of a material fact or omit to
            state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
            make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
            which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) complied in all
            material respects with the requirements of applicable securities
            Laws. Seagram has not filed any material confidential material
            change report with the OSC or any other securities authority or
            regulator or any stock exchange or other self-regulatory authority
            which at the date hereof remains confidential.

      (l)   Compliance with Laws. Since January 1, 1998, Seagram and the Seagram
            Material Subsidiaries have complied with and are not in violation of
            any applicable Laws, orders, judgments and decrees other than
            non-compliance or violations which would not, individually or in the
            aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Seagram.

      (m)   Licences, etc. Seagram and each Seagram Material Subsidiary owns,
            possesses, or has obtained and is in compliance with, all licences,
            permits, certificates, orders, grants and other authorizations of or
            from any Governmental Entity necessary to conduct its businesses as
            now conducted except for such failure that would not, individually
            or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Seagram.

      (n)   Registration Rights. No holder of securities issued by Seagram has
            any right to compel Seagram to register or otherwise qualify such
            securities for public sale in Canada or the United States.

      (o)   Intellectual Property. None of Seagram nor any Seagram Material
            Subsidiary has received written notice or is aware that its use of
            its material registered trade- marks, service marks, copyrights,
            industrial designs, patents, design patents and all applications
            therefor ("SEAGRAM IP") infringes upon or breaches the industrial or
            intellectual property rights of any other Person, except with
            respect to any such infringements or breaches which would not,
            individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
            Seagram. Except as set forth in the Seagram Disclosure Letter,
            Seagram has not commenced material legal proceedings relating to an
            infringement by any Person of the Seagram IP. Seagram, to its
            knowledge, has or has rights to use all of the intellectual property
            necessary to conduct the business of Seagram as currently carried on
            except where the failure to do so


                                      A-30
<PAGE>   34
            would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
            Effect on Seagram.

      (p)   Non-Arm's Length Transactions. There are no contracts, commitments,
            agreements, arrangements or other transactions between Seagram or

            commitments, agreements, arrangements or other transactions that are
            either on arm's length terms or, to the extent not on arm's length
            terms, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
            Adverse Effect on Seagram.

SECTION 3.2 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE VIVENDI PARTIES, CANAL AND
SOFIEE.

(1)   Except as Publicly Disclosed by Vivendi or as set forth in the Vivendi
      Disclosure Letter, each of the Vivendi Parties and Sofiee represent and
      warrant to and in favour of Seagram as follows and acknowledge that
      Seagram is relying upon such representations and warranties in connection
      with the matters contemplated by this Agreement:

      (a)   Organization.

            (i)   Each of the Vivendi Parties and each of the Vivendi Material
                  Subsidiaries has been duly incorporated or formed under all
                  applicable Laws, is validly subsisting and has full corporate
                  or legal power and authority to own its properties and conduct
                  its businesses as currently owned and conducted, except, in
                  the case of the Vivendi Material Subsidiaries (other than
                  Sofiee and Vivendi Exchangeco), where the failure to be so
                  incorporated or formed or subsisting or to have such power and
                  authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
                  Material Adverse Effect on Vivendi. All of the outstanding
                  shares and other ownership interests of the Vivendi Material
                  Subsidiaries which are held directly or indirectly by Vivendi
                  are owned directly or indirectly by Vivendi, free and clear of
                  all material liens, claims or encumbrances, or pursuant to
                  restrictions on transfers contained in articles or similar
                  documents.

            (ii)  All of the Vivendi Shares, Vivendi ADSs, Vivendi ADRs and the
                  Vivendi Voting Rights to be issued by Vivendi in connection
                  with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all
                  of the Exchangeable Shares to be issued by Vivendi Exchangeco

            date). Neither Vivendi nor any of its affiliates beneficially own
            any Seagram Shares.

                  executed and delivered by each of Vivendi and Sofiee, to the
                  extent a party thereto, and constitutes its legal, valid and
                  binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with
                  its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and other
                  applicable Laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and to
                  general principles of equity. Each of the Support Agreement,
                  the Custody Agreement, the Exchange Trust Agreement and the
                  Vivendi/Canal Agreements will be duly executed and delivered

                  its subsidiaries, in each case to the extent a party thereto
                  and, when so executed and delivered, will constitute their
                  respective legal, valid and binding obligations, enforceable

                  hereof this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
                  this Agreement (including the Vivendi/Canal Transactions).
                  Vivendi is not subject to a shareholder rights plan or "poison
                  pill" or similar plan.

                        of:

                        (I)   its or any Vivendi Material Subsidiary's

                              Parties), except to the extent that the violation

                              judgment or decree would not, individually or in
                              the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
                              Vivendi; or

                        (III) except as would not, individually or in the
                              aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
                              Vivendi, any contract, agreement, license,
                              franchise or permit to which Vivendi or any
                              Vivendi Material Subsidiary is party or by which

                        cause any such indebtedness to come due before its
                        stated maturity, or cause any available credit of any
                        Vivendi Party or any subsidiary to cease to be
                        available, other than as would not, individually or in
                        the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
                        Vivendi;

                  (C)   except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
                        have a Material Adverse Effect on Vivendi, result in the
                        imposition of any encumbrance, charge or lien upon any
                        of its assets or the assets of any Vivendi Material
                        Subsidiary; or

                  (D)   except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
                        have a Material Adverse Effect on Vivendi, restrict,
                        hinder, impair or limit the ability of Vivendi or any
                        Vivendi Material Subsidiary to carry on the business of
                        Vivendi or any Vivendi Material Subsidiary as and where
                        it is now being carried on.

                  No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
                  declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is
                  required to be obtained by any Vivendi Party, Sofiee or their
                  respective subsidiaries in connection with the execution and
                  delivery of this Agreement, the Option Agreement (other than
                  the approval of the TSE), the Exchange Trust Agreement, the
                  Support Agreement, the Custody Agreement and the Vivendi/Canal
                  Agreements, in each case to the extent it is a party thereto,
                  or the consummation by any Vivendi Party or Sofiee of the
                  transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than (A) the
                  Regulatory Approvals relating to the Vivendi Parties and
                  Sofiee, (B) any filings required in connection with the
                  creation and issue of the Vivendi ADSs, (C) any approval
                  required in connection with the amendment to the articles of
                  Vivendi Exchangeco to create the Exchangeable Shares and (D)
                  any other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
                  declarations or filings of or with a Governmental Entity


                                      A-34
<PAGE>   38
                  which have been set forth in the Vivendi Disclosure Letter, or
                  which, if not obtained, would not, individually or in the
                  aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Vivendi.

      (d)   No Defaults. Subject to obtaining the Regulatory Approvals relating
            to Vivendi, neither Vivendi nor any of its subsidiaries is in
            default under, and there exists no event, condition or occurrence
            which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such
            a default under, any contract, agreement, license or franchise to
            which it is a party which would, individually or in the aggregate,
            have a Material Adverse Effect on Vivendi.

      (e)   Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since December 31, 1999
            through to the date hereof, each of Vivendi, Vivendi Exchangeco and
            each Vivendi Material Subsidiary has conducted its business only in
            the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
            (except in connection with the transactions contemplated in this
            Agreement) and there has not occurred a Material Adverse Change with
            respect to Vivendi (which has not been cured).

      (f)   Financial Statements; Contingent Liabilities. The audited
            consolidated financial statements for Vivendi as at and for each of
            the 12-month periods ended on December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 have
            been prepared in accordance with French generally accepted
            accounting principles ("FRENCH GAAP"); such financial statements
            present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
            position and results of operations and cash flows of Vivendi and its
            subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the
            respective periods covered thereby. Except as Publicly Disclosed by
            Vivendi (including on the most recent consolidated balance sheet and
            the footnotes thereto included in the Vivendi Documents Publicly
            Disclosed by Vivendi), Vivendi and its subsidiaries have not
            incurred any liabilities that are of a nature that would be required
            to be disclosed on a balance sheet of Vivendi and its subsidiaries
            or the footnotes thereto prepared in conformity with French GAAP,
            other than (i) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
            business, (ii) liabilities for Taxes and (iii) liabilities that
            would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
            Effect on Vivendi.

      (g)   Litigation, etc. There is no claim, action, proceeding or suit
            pending or, to the knowledge of Vivendi, threatened against Vivendi
            or any Vivendi Material Subsidiary before any court or Governmental
            Entity that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
            Adverse Effect on Vivendi or that would prevent or materially delay
            consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
            the Arrangement. Neither Vivendi nor any Vivendi Material
            Subsidiary, nor any of their respective assets and properties, is
            subject to any outstanding judgment, order, writ, injunction or
            decree that would, individually or in the aggregate, have


                                      A-35
<PAGE>   39
            a Material Adverse Effect on Vivendi or that would prevent or
            materially delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by
            this Agreement or the Arrangement.

      (h)   Environmental. Except for any matters that would not, individually
            or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Vivendi:

            (i)   all operations of Vivendi and the Vivendi Material
                  Subsidiaries have been conducted, and are now, in compliance
                  with all Environmental Laws; and

            (ii)  neither Vivendi nor any Vivendi Material Subsidiary is subject
                  to:

                  (A)   any Environmental Law which, to the knowledge of
                        Vivendi, requires or may reasonably be expected to
                        require any material work, repairs, construction, change
                        in business practices or operations, or expenditures; or

                  (B)   any written demand or written notice with respect to a
                        breach of or liability under any Environmental Laws
                        applicable to Vivendi or any subsidiary; and

            (iii) to the knowledge of Vivendi, there is no reasonable basis for
                  any claim against Vivendi or any of its current or former
                  subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessor entities,
                  divisions, or any formerly owned, leased, or operated
                  properties or assets of the foregoing, under any Environmental
                  Laws or with respect to any Hazardous Substances.

      (i)   Reports. Vivendi has filed with the PSE, the CMF and the COB true
            and complete copies of all material forms, reports, schedules,
            statements and other documents required to be filed by it since
            January 1, 1998 (such forms, reports, schedules, statements and
            other documents, including any financial statements or other
            documents, including any schedules included therein, are referred to
            as the "VIVENDI DOCUMENTS"). The Vivendi Documents and any
            registration statements confidentially submitted with the SEC prior
            to the date hereof that have been made available to Seagram, at the
            time filed, (i) did not contain any misrepresentation of a material
            fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
            or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
            circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (ii)
            complied in all material respects with the requirements of
            applicable securities Laws.

      (j)   Compliance with Laws. Since January 1, 1998, Vivendi and the Vivendi
            Material Subsidiaries have complied with and are not in violation of
            any applicable Laws,


                                      A-36
<PAGE>   40
            orders, judgments and decrees other than non-compliance or
            violations which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
            Material Adverse Effect on Vivendi.

      (k)   Licences, etc. Vivendi and each Vivendi Material Subsidiary owns,
            possesses, or has obtained and is in compliance with, all licences,
            permits, certificates, orders, grants and other authorizations of or
            from any Governmental Entity necessary to conduct its businesses as
            now conducted except for such failure that would not, individually
            or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Vivendi.

      (l)   Intellectual Property. None of Vivendi nor any Vivendi Material
            Subsidiary has received written notice or is aware that its use of
            its material registered trade- marks, service marks, copyrights,
            industrial designs, patents, design patents and all applications
            therefor ("VIVENDI IP") infringes upon or breaches the industrial or
            intellectual property rights of any other Person, except with
            respect to any such infringements or breaches which would not,
            individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
            Vivendi. Except as set forth in the Vivendi Disclosure Letter,
            Vivendi has not commenced material legal proceedings relating to an
            infringement by any Person of the Vivendi IP. Vivendi, to its
            knowledge, has or has rights to use all of the intellectual property
            necessary to conduct the business of Vivendi as currently carried on
            except where the failure to do so would not, individually or in the
            aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Vivendi.

      (m)   Tax Matters. Neither Vivendi nor any of its subsidiaries has taken
            any action or failed to take any action, or has knowledge of any
            fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that is reasonably
            likely to prevent the Arrangement and the Vivendi/Canal Transactions
            from constituting a transaction described in Section 351 of the
            Code.

(2)   Except as Publicly Disclosed by Vivendi or as set forth in the Canal
      Disclosure Letter, Canal represents and warrants to and in favour of
      Seagram as follows and acknowledges that Seagram is relying upon such
      representations and warranties in connection with the matters contemplated
      by this Agreement:

      (a)   Organization. Each of Canal and the Canal Material Subsidiaries has
            been duly incorporated or formed under all applicable Laws, is
            validly subsisting and has full corporate or legal power and
            authority to own its properties and conduct its businesses as
            currently owned and conducted , except, in the case of the Canal
            Material Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so incorporated or
            formed or subsisting or to have such power and authority would not,
            individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
            Canal. All of the outstanding shares and other ownership interests
            of the Canal Material Subsidiaries which are held


                                      A-37

                              or permit to which Canal or any Canal Material
                              Subsidiary is party or by which it is bound or
                              subject or is the beneficiary;

                  (B)   give rise to any right of termination or acceleration of
                        indebtedness of Canal or any subsidiary, or cause any
                        such indebtedness to come due before its stated
                        maturity, or cause any available credit of Canal or any
                        subsidiary to cease to be available, other than as would

                  (C)   except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
                        have a Material Adverse Effect on Canal, result in the
                        imposition of any encumbrance, charge or lien upon any
                        of its assets or the assets of any Canal Material
                        Subsidiary; or

                  (D)   except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
                        have a Material Adverse Effect on Canal, restrict,
                        hinder, impair or limit the ability of Canal or any
                        Canal Material Subsidiary to carry on the business of
                        Canal or any Canal Material Subsidiary as and where it
                        is now being carried on.

                  No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
                  declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is
                  required to be obtained by Canal or its subsidiaries in
                  connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
                  and the Vivendi/Canal Agreements, in each case to the extent
                  it is a party thereto, or the consummation by Canal of the
                  transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than (A) the
                  Regulatory Approvals relating to Canal and (B) any other
                  consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, declarations or
                  filings of or with a Governmental Entity which have been set
                  forth in the Canal Disclosure Letter, or which, if not
                  obtained, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
                  Material Adverse Effect on Canal.

      (d)   No Defaults. Subject to obtaining the Regulatory Approvals relating
            to Canal, neither Canal nor any of its subsidiaries is in default
            under, and there exists no event, condition or occurrence which,
            after notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a
            default under, any contract, agreement, license or franchise to
            which it is a party which would, individually or in the aggregate,
            have a Material Adverse Effect on Canal.

      (e)   Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since December 31, 1999
            through to the date hereof, each of Canal and each Canal Material
            Subsidiary has conducted its business only in the ordinary and
            regular course of business consistent with past practice (except in
            connection with the transactions contemplated hereby) and there has
            not occurred a Material Adverse Change with respect to Canal (which
            has not been cured).

      (f)   Financial Statements; Contingent Liabilities. The audited
            consolidated financial statements for Canal as at and for each of
            the 12-month periods ended on December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 have
            been prepared in accordance with French GAAP; such financial
            statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
            consolidated financial position and results of operations and cash
            flows of Canal


                                      A-40
<PAGE>   44
            and its subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the
            respective periods covered thereby. Except as Publicly Disclosed by
            Vivendi (including on the most recent consolidated balance sheet and
            the footnotes thereto included in the Canal Documents Publicly
            Disclosed by Vivendi), Canal and its subsidiaries have not incurred
            any liabilities that are of a nature that would be required to be
            disclosed on a balance sheet of Canal and its subsidiaries or the
            footnotes thereto prepared in conformity with French GAAP, other
            than (i) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business,
            (ii) liabilities for Taxes and (iii) liabilities that would not,
            individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
            Canal.

      (g)   Litigation, etc. There is no claim, action, proceeding or suit
            pending or, to the knowledge of Canal, threatened against Canal or
            any Canal Material Subsidiary before any court or Governmental
            Entity that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
            Adverse Effect on Canal or that would prevent or materially delay
            consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
            the Arrangement. Neither Canal nor any Canal Material Subsidiary,
            nor any of their respective assets and properties, is subject to any
            outstanding judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree that would,
            individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
            Canal or that would prevent or materially delay consummation of the
            transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Arrangement.

      (h)   Environmental. Except for any matters that would not, individually
            or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Canal:

            (i)   all operations of Canal and the Canal Material Subsidiaries
                  have been conducted, and are now, in compliance with all
                  Environmental Laws; and

            (ii)  neither Canal nor any Canal Material Subsidiary is subject to:

                  (A)   any Environmental Law which, to the knowledge of Canal,
                        requires or may reasonably be expected to require any
                        material work, repairs, construction, change in business
                        practices or operations, or expenditures; or

                  (B)   any written demand or written notice with respect to a
                        breach of or liability under any Environmental Laws
                        applicable to Canal or any subsidiary; and

            (iii) to the knowledge of Canal, there is no reasonable basis for
                  any claim against Canal or any of its current or former
                  subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessor entities,
                  divisions, or any formerly owned, leased, or


                                      A-41

                  operated properties or assets of the foregoing, under any
                  Environmental Laws or with respect to any Hazardous
                  Substances.

      (i)   Reports. Canal has filed with the PSE, the CMF and the COB true and
            complete copies of all material forms, reports, schedules,
            statements and other documents required to be filed by it since
            January 1, 1998 (such forms, reports, schedules, statements and
            other documents, including any financial statements or other
            documents, including any schedules included therein, are referred to
            as the "CANAL DOCUMENTS"). The Canal Documents at the time filed (i)
            did not contain any misrepresentation of a material fact or omit to
            state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
            make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
            which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) complied in all
            material respects with the requirements of applicable securities
            Laws.

      (j)   Compliance with Laws. Since January 1, 1998, Canal and the Canal
            Material Subsidiaries have complied with and are not in violation of
            any applicable Laws, orders, judgments and decrees other than
            non-compliance or violations which would not, individually or in the
            aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Canal.

      (k)   Licences, etc. Canal and each Canal Material Subsidiary owns,
            possesses, or has obtained and is in compliance with, all licences,
            permits, certificates, orders, grants and other authorizations of or
            from any Governmental Entity necessary to conduct its businesses as
            now conducted except for such failure that would not, individually
            or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Canal.

      (l)   Intellectual Property. None of Canal nor any Canal Material
            Subsidiary has received written notice or is aware that its use of
            its material registered trade- marks, service marks, copyrights,
            industrial designs, patents, design patents and all applications
            therefor ("CANAL IP") infringes upon or breaches the industrial or
            intellectual property rights of any other Person, except with
            respect to any such infringements or breaches which would not,
            individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
            Canal. Except as set forth in the Canal Disclosure Letter, Canal has
            not commenced material legal proceedings relating to an infringement
            by any Person of the Canal IP. Canal, to its knowledge, has or has
            rights to use all of the intellectual property necessary to conduct
            the business of Canal as currently carried on except where the
            failure to do so would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
            Material Adverse Effect on Canal.

                  organization and preserve its relationship with those having
                  material business dealings with it to the end that its
                  goodwill and ongoing business shall not be impaired in any
                  material respect, provided, however, that no action by Seagram
                  or its subsidiaries with respect to matters specifically

                  be deemed a breach of this Section 4.3(a)(i) unless such
                  action would constitute a breach of one or more of such other
                  provisions;

            (other than Vivendi) as a disregarded entity under Section
            301.7701-3 of the Treasury Regulations and shall refrain from taking
            any actions that would prevent any of such entities from being
            treated as a disregarded entity under Section 301.7701-3 of the
            Treasury Regulations. Vivendi Holdings and each of such other

      (p)   with respect to Seagram Options and Seagram SARs:

                  (i) each Seagram Option granted prior to the Effective Time
            that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
            shall cease to represent a right to acquire Seagram Common Shares
            and shall be converted (each, as so converted, a "Seagram Converted
            Option"), at the Effective Time, into an option to acquire, on the
            same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Seagram
            Option (including, without limitation, the practice of "rule of 65"
            retirement, applied on a basis consistent with past practice, which
            allows an option holder who is at least 50 years old to retire under
            the Seagram Stock Plans so long as the sum of such holder's age and
            years of service is at least 65), that number of Vivendi ADSs
            determined by multiplying the number of Seagram Common Shares
            subject to such Seagram Option by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to
            the nearest whole Vivendi ADS, at a price per share (rounded off to
            the nearest cent) equal to the per share exercise price specified in
            such Seagram Option divided by the Exchange Ratio; provided,
            however, that 50% of each holder's outstanding, unvested Seagram
            Converted Options shall be immediately vested and exercisable at the
            Effective Time (applied pro rata against each subsequent vesting
            installment); provided, further, that the remainder of a holder's
            outstanding, unvested Seagram Converted Options shall become
            immediately vested and exercisable if, following the Effective Time,
            (A) such holder's employment is terminated by Vivendi, Canal,
            Seagram or any of their respective affiliates without Cause (as
            defined below) or (B) such holder terminates his or her employment
            by reason of Vivendi, Canal, Seagram or any of their respective
            affiliates requiring such holder to relocate his or her primary
            place of employment by more than 35 miles. For purposes of this
            Agreement, "Cause" shall mean (A) the holder's conviction of, or
            plea of no contest to, a felony or (B) the holder's willful
            malfeasance or willful misconduct in connection with his or her
            duties to Seagram, or the holder's willful refusal to perform his or
            her duties which, in each case, results in demonstrable harm to the
            financial condition or business reputation of Vivendi, Canal,
            Seagram or any of their respective affiliates;

                  (ii) each Seagram SAR granted prior to the Effective Time that
            remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
            converted so that the number and kind of shares subject to such
            right and the exercise price thereof (if any) shall be adjusted, at
            the Effective Time, in the same manner as provided in Section
            4.4(p)(i) above for the conversion of Seagram Options;

                  (iii) as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Vivendi
            shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the holders of Seagram
            Converted Options and Seagram SARs appropriate notices setting forth
            such holders' rights pursuant to the respective Seagram Stock Plans
            and agreements evidencing the grants of such


                                      A-55
<PAGE>   59
            Seagram Converted Options and Seagram SARs and stating that such
            Seagram Converted Options and Seagram SARs and agreements have been
            assumed by Vivendi or Seagram as Vivendi shall determine and shall
            continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
            adjustments required by this Section 4.4(p) after giving effect to
            the transactions hereunder and the terms of the Seagram Stock
            Plans); and

                  (iv) prior to the Effective Time, Vivendi shall take all
            necessary action to assume or have Seagram assume as of the
            Effective Time all obligations undertaken by Vivendi under this
            Section 4.4(p) and to adopt at the Effective Time the Seagram Stock
            Plans and each Seagram Converted Option and Seagram SAR and to take
            all other actions called for by this Section 4.4(p), including the
            reservation, issuance and listing by Vivendi of a number of Vivendi
            ADSs at least equal to the number of Vivendi ADSs that will be
            subject to Seagram Converted Options and Seagram SARs; provided,
            however, that nothing in subsections (iii) and (iv) hereof shall
            relieve Vivendi of its obligations to provide Vivendi ADSs to
            satisfy all obligations hereunder, and Vivendi hereby guarantees the
            performance of such obligations by Seagram in any event. No later
            than the Effective Time, Vivendi shall file a registration statement
            on Form S-8 (or any successor or, including if Form S-8 is not
            available, other appropriate forms) ("FORM S-8") with respect to the
            Vivendi ADSs subject to such Seagram Converted Options and Seagram
            SARs and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration
            statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
            status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
            long as such options remain outstanding;

      (q)   with respect to any Seagram North American retiree medical and life
            plan, neither Vivendi nor Canal shall, and they shall cause Seagram
            not to, amend or terminate such plan following the Effective Time in
            any manner which results in the reduction or elimination of the
            benefits available thereunder or increases in costs, other than any
            copayment and cost sharing increases (which may be continued in the
            same proportions to Seagram-provided portions of cost) to any former
            Seagram Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) who is
            receiving such benefits thereunder as of the date hereof, or any
            active Seagram Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) who
            would be eligible for such benefits if he or she retired on the
            Effective Date (or who, as of the Effective Date, is within two
            years of being able to retire and receive benefits thereunder);

      (r)   until the second anniversary of the Effective Date (or longer, if
            required by Law), Vivendi and/or Canal shall, or shall cause Seagram
            or its subsidiaries to, provide each Seagram Employee (who is
            employed on the Effective Time and who continues his or her
            employment with Vivendi, Canal, Seagram or any of their respective
            affiliates) with a base salary at least equal to that provided to
            such

            Seagram Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
            overall employee benefits (but excluding for these purposes any
            retention bonuses or plans that provide for equity or equity-based
            compensation) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than
            those provided immediately prior to the Effective Time to Seagram
            Employees generally, except for any changes made to comply with
            applicable Law or tax qualification nondiscrimination rules. Vivendi
            and/or Canal shall, or shall cause Seagram to, maintain the
            severance related provisions of existing Seagram Plans as currently
            administered and to provide the current cash severance payments
            required thereunder, for at least two years following the Effective
            Time, to the Seagram Employees, reduced by any severance payments
            otherwise required under existing severance and employment
            agreements or applicable Law (unless, with respect to the severance
            benefit, no such reduction is permitted or provided for); provided
            however, that any Seagram Employee eligible to receive severance
            under a Seagram Plan but for the transactions contemplated herein,
            shall be deemed so eligible. Seagram Employees shall be credited for
            service with Seagram and its current and former affiliates for all
            purposes under each employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of
            Vivendi, Canal or their respective affiliates in which such
            employees are eligible to participate (unless such credit would
            result in a duplication of benefits). If Seagram Employees become
            eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health plan, program
            or arrangement of Vivendi, Canal or their respective affiliates,
            such arrangement sponsor shall cause such arrangement to (i) waive
            any preexisting condition limitations (to the extent such
            limitations were inapplicable to a Seagram Employee immediately
            before such arrangement was so made available to such Seagram
            Employee) and (ii) honor any deductible and out-of-pocket expenses
            incurred by the Seagram Employees and their dependents under similar
            Seagram Plans during the portion of the plan year prior to such
            participation. Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict, limit or
            interfere with the ability (after the Effective Time) of Seagram,
            Vivendi, Canal or their respective affiliates to terminate, amend or
            replace any particular agreement, plan or program, or terminate the
            employment of any person, provided that the requirements of Sections
            4.4(p) through (w) are otherwise satisfied;

      (s)   Seagram shall be permitted to award a bonus, in respect of Seagram's
            fiscal year 2000, to each Seagram Employee who currently
            participates in a Seagram bonus plan, pursuant to the existing terms
            and conditions of such plan on the date hereof. With respect to
            Seagram's fiscal year 2001 and any stub period between the end of
            fiscal year 2001 and the beginning of calendar year 2002 ("Stub
            Period"), Seagram shall be permitted to award a bonus to each
            Seagram Employee who participates in a Seagram bonus plan, in an
            amount no less than 80% of such employee's target bonus as of the
            Effective Time, or one half thereof in the case of the Stub Period
            pursuant to the existing terms and conditions of such plan on the
            date hereof, provided, however, if any such employee is terminated
            by Vivendi, Canal, Seagram


                                      A-57
<PAGE>   61
            or any of their respective affiliates without Cause, such employee
            will be entitled to receive an amount equal to 80% of his or her
            target bonus as of the Effective Time, or one-half thereof in the
            case of the Stub Period, prorated based on the number of days in
            fiscal year 2001 or the Stub Period, as applicable, prior to such
            termination;

      (t)   Vivendi shall, or shall cause Seagram to, provide as a retention
            pool the amount set forth on the Seagram Disclosure Letter, for the
            purpose of retaining the services of selected key Seagram Employees
            through the Effective Time and thereafter. Prior to the Effective
            Time, the CEO of Seagram, in close cooperation with the CEO of
            Vivendi, shall select those Seagram Employees who may receive awards
            from such pool, shall establish any criteria for allocating such
            awards and shall determine the final allocation of awards from such
            pool. Fifty percent of such awards shall be paid in cash, in a lump
            sum, at the Effective Time, with the balance payable in cash on the
            first anniversary of the Effective Time (provided the recipient
            remains employed by Seagram, Vivendi, Canal or any of their
            respective affiliates through such dates, or is terminated without
            Cause prior to such dates);

      (u)   Seagram, Vivendi and Canal agree to cooperate reasonably during the
            period prior to the Effective Time to ensure the continuity of the
            workforce of Seagram and its subsidiaries and to preserve the human
            resources of Seagram and its subsidiaries;

      (v)   effective as of the Effective Time, Vivendi expressly assumes the
            obligations and liabilities under the termination protection
            agreements and employment agreements set forth on the Seagram
            Disclosure Letter between Seagram and various employees;

      (w)   Seagram shall enter into the employment agreement and other
            arrangements contemplated by the Seagram Disclosure Letter, to be
            effective as of the Effective Time, in accordance with the terms and
            conditions disclosed in the Seagram Disclosure Letter, and such
            employment agreement and other arrangements shall continue in effect
            from and after the Effective Time;

      (x)   the parties to this Agreement agree that provision of charitable
            contributions and community support serves a number of important
            goals. Vivendi and its subsidiaries (including Seagram following the
            Effective Time) currently intend to continue, after the Effective
            Time, to provide charitable contributions and community support
            within each of the jurisdictions in which Seagram conducts its
            business at levels comparable to those Seagram and its subsidiaries
            have historically provided within such jurisdictions;


                                      A-58
<PAGE>   62
      (y)   Vivendi shall take all necessary actions (including, in connection
            with any proposed preemptive rights offering, make any necessary
            securities laws filing) to ensure that all holders of Vivendi Shares
            or Vivendi Securities, regardless of jurisdiction of residence, are
            entitled to all the benefits (including the right to acquire Vivendi
            Securities pursuant to preemptive rights) related to such Vivendi
            Shares or Vivendi Securities to which holders of Vivendi Shares are
            entitled pursuant to French Law;

      (z)   Vivendi, Sofiee and Canal shall provide Seagram with a reasonable
            opportunity to review and comment upon the agreements related to the
            creation of the Vivendi ADSs and Vivendi ADRs and each of the
            Vivendi/Canal Agreements, in each case prior to the execution and
            delivery of such agreements, and such agreements shall be reasonably
            acceptable to Seagram. Vivendi, Sofiee and Canal agree that the
            Vivendi/Canal Transactions shall be effected by them in the manner
            and on the terms specified in Schedule I, including application of
            the exchange ratio specified therein, and on such other terms and
            agreements as are reasonably acceptable to Seagram;

      (aa)  At the request of Seagram, Vivendi shall enter into a supplemental
            agreement pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of
            June 21, 1999, between Seagram and The Bank of New York whereby
            Vivendi shall assume the obligations of Seagram under the Seagram
            ACES (which supplemental agreement shall include appropriate
            provisions pursuant to which holders of Seagram ACES shall
            thereafter be entitled to purchase Vivendi ADSs in lieu of Seagram
            Common Shares); and

      (bb)  Vivendi, Sofiee and Vivendi Exchangeco shall increase, at Seagram's
            election, the Vivendi ADS Adjustment Ratio (as defined in the Plan
            of Arrangement) and decrease the Exchange Ratio applicable to
            Exchangeable Elected Shares (as defined in the Plan of Arrangement)
            as necessary to permit a Vivendi Voting Right to be available in
            respect of each Exchangeable Share, and appropriate amendments to
            the economic equivalence provisions in the Support Agreement and the
            Exchange Trust Agreement will be made in connection therewith to
            ensure that the increased Vivendi ADS Adjustment Ratio is applied to
            any required adjustments.

SECTION 4.5 COVENANTS REGARDING NON-SOLICITATION OF SEAGRAM.

(1)   Seagram shall not, directly or indirectly, through any officer or director
      of Seagram or any of its subsidiaries, and shall use its reasonable best
      efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries' employees, agents and
      representatives (including any investment banker, lawyer or accountant)
      not to (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or otherwise facilitate



                                      A-59
<PAGE>   63
        (including by way of furnishing information) the initiation of any
         inquiries or proposals regarding a Seagram Acquisition Proposal or (ii)
         participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide
         any confidential information with respect to, any Seagram Acquisition
         Proposal. None of Seagram or the Board of Directors of Seagram shall
         (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a
         manner adverse to Vivendi or Canal the approval or recommendation of
         the Board of Directors of Seagram or any committee thereof of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend,
         or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Seagram Acquisition
         Proposal or (iii) accept or enter into, or propose publicly to accept
         or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
         agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or voting agreement
         related to any Seagram Acquisition Proposal.

 (2)     Notwithstanding Section 4.5(1) and any other provision of this
         Agreement, the Board of Directors of Seagram shall be permitted to (A)
         to the extent applicable, comply with Rule 14a-9, Rule 14d-9 and Rule
         14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or Section 99 of the
         Securities Act with regard to any Seagram Acquisition Proposal, or make
         any other disclosure required by applicable Law so long as any such
         disclosure rejects any Seagram Acquisition Proposal and reaffirms its
         recommendation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
         take any other action to the extent ordered or otherwise mandated by
         any court of competent jurisdiction, (B) withdraw, modify or qualify
         (or propose to withdraw, modify or qualify), in any manner adverse to
         Vivendi or Canal, the approval or recommendation of the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement, or (C) engage in any discussions or
         negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person in
         response to a Seagram Acquisition Proposal by any such Person, if and
         only to the extent that, in any such case referred to in clause (B) or
         (C), (i) the Seagram Meeting shall not have occurred, (ii) (x) in the
         case of clause (B) above, it has received an unsolicited written
         Seagram Acquisition Proposal and its Board of Directors concludes in
         good faith that such Seagram Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Seagram
         Superior Proposal and (y) in the case of clause (C) above, its Board of
         Directors concludes in good faith there is a reasonable likelihood that
         its Board of Directors, after taking the steps described in clause (C)
         above, would determine that such Seagram Acquisition Proposal could
         reasonably constitute a Seagram Superior Proposal, (iii) in the case of
         clause (B) or (C) above, its Board of Directors, after consultation
         with outside counsel, determines in good faith that the failure to take
         such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
         applicable law, (iv) prior to providing any confidential information or
         data to any Person in connection with a Seagram Acquisition Proposal by
         any such Person, its Board of Directors receives from such Person an
         executed confidentiality agreement having provisions that are customary
         in such agreements, as advised by counsel, provided that if such
         confidentiality agreement contains provisions that are less restrictive
         than the comparable provisions, or omits restrictive provisions,
         contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, then the Confidentiality
         Agreement will be deemed to be amended to contain only such less
         restrictive provisions or to omit such

                                      A-60
<PAGE>   64
         restrictive provisions, as the case may be, and (v) prior to providing
         any information or data to any Person or entering into discussions or
         negotiations with any Person, Seagram notifies Vivendi promptly of such
         inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such information
         requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to be
         initiated or continued with, any of its representatives indicating, in
         connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material
         terms and conditions of such inquiries, proposals or offers, and
         thereafter keeps Vivendi informed with respect to the status of such
         inquiries, proposals or offers (including any change to the material
         terms thereof).

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, upon taking
any of the actions permitted by clause (B) of Section 4.5(2), Seagram may, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, convene and hold the Seagram Meeting as
soon as possible and earlier than any then scheduled date. Seagram shall, and
shall cause the officers, directors, representatives and agents of Seagram and
its subsidiaries to, cease immediately all current discussions and negotiations
as of the date of this Agreement regarding any proposal that constitutes, or
could reasonably likely constitute, a Seagram Acquisition Proposal, and shall
promptly request the return or destruction of all confidential information
provided in connection therewith.

(3)      Seagram shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that its
         officers, directors and key employees and its subsidiaries and their
         officers, directors and key employees and any financial advisors or
         other advisors or representatives retained by it or its subsidiaries
         are aware of the provisions of this Section 4.5.

(4)      Nothing contained in this Section 4.5 shall limit in any way the
         obligation of Seagram to convene and hold the Seagram Meeting in
         accordance with Section 2.1 of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section
         4.5 shall permit Seagram to terminate this Agreement (except as
         specifically provided in Article 6 hereof). Seagram shall not submit to
         the vote of its shareholders any Seagram Acquisition Proposal other
         than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless required
         by Section 137 (in the case of an annual meeting) or Section 143 of the
         CBCA, provided, however, Seagram will not call any shareholder meeting
         pursuant to such provisions of the CBCA to consider a Seagram
         Acquisition Proposal unless the Board of Directors of Seagram receive a
         written legal opinion that the failure to do so would be in breach of
         its statutory duties and provided, further, that before the Board of
         Directors of Seagram calls any such meeting it will consult with
         Vivendi in order to ensure that the timing, calling and holding of such
         meeting, to the extent permitted by Law, will not be inconsistent with
         the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         the extent similar to such U.S. regulations with regard to any Vivendi
         Acquisition Proposal, or make any other disclosure required by
         applicable Law so long as any such disclosure rejects any Vivendi
         Acquisition Proposal and reaffirms its recommendation of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or take any other action
         to the extent ordered or otherwise mandated by any court of competent
         jurisdiction, (B) withdraw, modify or qualify (or propose to withdraw,

         referred to in clause (B) or (C), (i) the Vivendi Meeting shall not
         have occurred, (ii) (x) in the case of clause (B) above, it has
         received an unsolicited written Vivendi Acquisition Proposal and its

         Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Vivendi Superior Proposal and (y) in
         the case of clause (C) above, its Board of Directors concludes in good
         faith there is a reasonable likelihood that its Board of Directors,

         Vivendi Superior Proposal, (iii) in the case of clause (B) or (C)
         above, its Board of Directors, after consultation with outside counsel,

         confidentiality agreement contains provisions that are less restrictive
         than the comparable provisions, or omits restrictive provisions,
         contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, then the Confidentiality
         Agreement will be deemed to be amended to contain only such less

         Person or entering into discussions or negotiations with any Person,
         Vivendi notifies Seagram promptly of such inquiries, proposals or

         14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or applicable French Law to
         the extent similar to such U.S. regulations with regard to any Canal
         Acquisition Proposal, or make any other disclosure required by
         applicable Law so long as any such disclosure rejects any Canal
         Acquisition Proposal and reaffirms its recommendation of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or take any other action
         to the extent ordered or otherwise mandated by any court of competent
         jurisdiction, (B) withdraw, modify or qualify (or propose to withdraw,
         modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to Seagram, the approval or
         recommendation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
         (C) engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
         information to, any Person in response to a Canal Acquisition Proposal
         by any such Person, if and only to the extent that, in any such case
         referred to in clause (B) or (C), (i) the Canal Meeting shall not have
         occurred, (ii) (x) in the case of clause (B) above, it has received an
         unsolicited written Canal Acquisition Proposal and its Board of
         Directors concludes in good faith that such Canal Acquisition Proposal
         constitutes a Canal Superior Proposal and (y) in the case of clause (C)
         above, its Board of Directors concludes in good faith that there is a
         reasonable likelihood that its Board of Directors, after taking the
         steps described in clause (C) above, would determine that such Canal
         Acquisition Proposal could reasonably constitute a Canal Superior
         Proposal, (iii) in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, its Board of
         Directors, after consultation with outside counsel, determines in good
         faith that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
         its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (iv) prior to providing any
         confidential information or data to any Person in connection with a
         Canal Acquisition Proposal by any such Person, its Board of Directors
         receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement having
         provisions that are customary in such agreements, as advised by
         counsel, provided that if such confidentiality agreement contains
         provisions that are less restrictive than the comparable provisions, or
         omits restrictive provisions, contained in the Confidentiality
         Agreement, then the Confidentiality Agreement will be deemed to be
         amended to contain only such less restrictive provisions or to omit
         such restrictive


                                      A-64
<PAGE>   68
         provisions, as the case may be, and (v) prior to providing any
         information or data to any Person or entering into discussions or
         negotiations with any Person, Canal notifies Seagram promptly of such
         inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such information
         requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to be
         initiated or continued with, any of its representatives indicating, in
         connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material
         terms and conditions of such inquiries, proposals or offers, and
         thereafter keeps Seagram informed with respect to the status of such
         inquiries, proposals or offers (including any change to the material
         terms thereof).

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, upon taking
any of the actions permitted by clause (B) of Section 4.7(2), Canal may, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, convene and hold the Canal Meeting as soon
as possible and earlier than any then scheduled date. Canal shall, and shall
cause the officers, directors, representatives and agents of Canal and its
subsidiaries to, cease immediately all current discussions and negotiations as
of the date of this Agreement regarding any proposal that constitutes, or could
reasonably likely constitute, a Canal Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly
request the return or destruction of all confidential information provided in
connection therewith.

(3)      Canal shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that its
         officers, directors and key employees and its subsidiaries and their
         officers, directors and key employees and any financial advisors or
         other advisors or representatives retained by it or its subsidiaries
         are aware of the provisions of this Section 4.7.

(4)      Nothing contained in this Section 4.7 shall limit in any way the
         obligations of Canal to convene and hold the Canal Meeting in
         accordance with Section 2.2 of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section
         4.7 shall permit Canal to terminate this Agreement (except as
         specifically provided in Article 6 hereof). Canal shall not submit to
         the vote of its shareholders any Canal Acquisition Proposal other than
         the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 4.8       ACCESS TO INFORMATION.

(1)      Subject to Section 4.8(2) and applicable Laws, upon reasonable notice,
         Seagram, on the one hand, and Vivendi and Canal, on the other hand,
         shall (and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to) afford the other
         party's officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
         representatives and advisors ("REPRESENTATIVES") access, during normal
         business hours from the date hereof and until the earlier of the
         Effective Date or the termination of this Agreement, to its and its
         subsidiaries' properties, books, contracts and records as well as to
         its management personnel, and, during such period, Seagram, on the one
         hand, and Vivendi and Canal, on the other hand, shall (and shall cause
         each of its subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other party all
         information concerning its and its subsidiaries' businesses, properties
         and personnel as such other party may reasonably

                                      A-65
<PAGE>   69
         request, in each case subject to confidentiality obligations and other
         protection of proprietary information. Subject to Section 4.8(2) and
         applicable Laws, upon reasonable notice, Seagram, on the one hand, and
         Vivendi and Canal, on the other hand, shall afford the other party's
         Representatives the opportunity, upon reasonable notice and during
         normal business hours from the date hereof and until the earlier of the
         Effective Date or termination of this Agreement, to speak to
         appropriate management personnel as such other party may reasonably
         request, without materially interfering with their other
         responsibilities. In addition, subject to applicable Law, during the
         Pre-Effective Date Period, the Chief Executive Officer of Seagram will
         be provided with reasonable notice of meetings of Vivendi's and Canal's
         Board of Directors and may attend any such meetings.

(2)      Each of Vivendi, Canal and Seagram acknowledges that certain
         information provided to it under Section 4.8(1) above will be
         non-public and/or proprietary in nature (the "INFORMATION") and will be
         subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and Section
         4.8(1). For greater certainty, the provisions of the Confidentiality
         Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement, provided
         that the Confidentiality Agreement, shall apply to each of the parties
         hereto and Section 4.8(1) shall terminate at the Effective Time
         notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained therein.

SECTION 4.9       INDEMNIFICATION.

         From and after the Effective Time, Vivendi and Seagram jointly and
severally shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of
expenses to, all past and present directors, officers and employees of Seagram
and its subsidiaries (in all of their capacities) (a) to the same extent such
persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the
date of this Agreement by Seagram pursuant to Seagram's articles of
incorporation, bylaws and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on
the date hereof with any directors, officers and employees of Seagram and its
subsidiaries and (b) without limitation to clause (a), to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, in each case for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with
the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) and (ii) include and cause to be maintained in
effect in Seagram's (or any successor's) articles of incorporation and bylaws
after the Effective Time, provisions regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement
of expenses which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in the current
articles of incorporation and bylaws of Seagram as of the date of this Agreement
and (iii) cause to be maintained for a period of six years after the Effective
Time the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Seagram (provided that Vivendi and
Seagram (or any successor) may substitute therefor one or more policies of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are,
in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time;


                                      A-66
<PAGE>   70
provided, however, that in no event shall Vivendi be required to expend in any
one year an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by
Seagram for such insurance; and provided further that if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Vivendi shall be obligated to obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount. The obligations of Vivendi and Seagram under this Section 4.9 shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee
to whom this Section 4.9 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee
(it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 4.9 applies
shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 4.9).

SECTION 4.10      SAFE INCOME.

         Seagram shall arrange for a "safe income tuck-in" transaction (the
         "TUCK-IN") or another form of safe income access transaction, to be
         offered to any Shareholder with respect to its shares of Seagram
         provided that:

         (a)      only two forms of transaction will be permitted;

         (b)      such transaction is to be completed in accordance with
                  applicable Laws prior to the Effective Date, or on the
                  Effective Date but prior to the Effective Time so long as
                  Vivendi, acting reasonably, agrees to such timing;

         (c)      such transaction must be accomplished in a manner that

                  (i)      provides for (A) the payment by each applicable
                           Shareholder of any material (or, if required by any
                           regulatory authority, all) costs and expenses
                           incurred in connection with such transaction by
                           Seagram and Vivendi, Vivendi Holdings and Vivendi
                           Exchangeco and any corporation acquired by any of
                           them, and (B) an indemnity in favor of Seagram and
                           Vivendi, Vivendi Holdings and Vivendi Exchangeco and
                           any corporation acquired by any of them by the
                           Shareholder and any vendor (each, a "VENDOR") of
                           Shares beneficially owned by such Shareholder from
                           all claims, demands, proceedings, losses, damages,
                           liabilities, deficiencies, taxes (including, without
                           limitation, federal or provincial taxes on income,
                           property, capital, sales, goods and services, and
                           excise duties, and any interest and penalties with
                           respect thereto, whether or not such taxes have been
                           assessed or reassessed as at the date of such
                           transaction), costs and expenses (including, without
                           limitation, all legal and other professional fees and
                           disbursements, interest, penalties and amounts paid
                           in settlement) (collectively, "LIABILITIES") suffered
                           or incurred by Seagram, Vivendi, Vivendi Holdings and
                           Vivendi Exchangeco or any corporation acquired by any
                           of them in such transaction (each, a "SUBCO") (and
                           their directors,

                                      A-67
<PAGE>   71
                           officers, employees and agents), the whole to be
                           computed on an after-tax basis, as a result of or
                           arising directly or indirectly out of or in respect
                           of or in connection with: (A) any breach by each such
                           Shareholder or Vendor of any representation,
                           warranty, obligation or covenant of the Shareholder
                           or Vendor to Seagram; (B) any Liability sustained,
                           incurred, assumed or acquired by any Subco on or
                           before, or related to any matter occurring on or
                           before, the completion of such transaction; and (C)
                           any Liability which would not have been sustained,
                           suffered or incurred by (or which would not have been
                           asserted, threatened, or be pending against) Seagram,
                           Vivendi, Vivendi Exchangeco and Vivendi Holdings but
                           for the transaction including, without limitation,
                           all Liabilities which are assumed or incurred by any
                           of Subco or Seagram, Vivendi, Vivendi Exchangeco and
                           Vivendi Holdings directly or indirectly in respect of
                           such transactions; and

                  (ii)     does not entail any delay in completing the
                           Arrangement, to Seagram, Vivendi or their respective
                           subsidiaries or shareholders; and

         (d)      the terms and conditions of such transaction must be
                  satisfactory to Vivendi and Seagram, acting reasonably, and
                  must include representations and warranties which are
                  satisfactory to Vivendi, acting reasonably, and an indemnity
                  from each applicable Shareholder and any Vendor which is in
                  form and substance satisfactory to Vivendi, acting reasonably.

         In the event that the terms and conditions of such transaction are not
         satisfactory to Vivendi, acting reasonably, or the Quebec Securities
         Commission or any other securities regulatory authority in Canada or a
         court pursuant to section 204 of the Canada Business Corporations Act
         refuses to grant any relief required in connection with any such
         transaction, Vivendi will use its reasonable best efforts, for a period
         not to exceed 15 Business Days, to assist Seagram in structuring such a
         transaction in a manner satisfactory to Vivendi, acting reasonably.

         In the event that the terms and conditions of such transaction are not
         satisfactory to Vivendi, acting reasonably, and no alternative
         transaction can be agreed upon as aforesaid where Vivendi has used its
         reasonable best efforts as aforesaid, this shall not affect the
         completion of the Arrangement or the other transactions contemplated by
         this Agreement.

         (b)      (i) the representations and warranties of Seagram set forth in
                  this Agreement that are qualified by Material Adverse Effect
                  shall be true and correct, (ii) the representations and
                  warranties of Seagram not so qualified (other than those

                  where the failure of any such representation and warranty
                  referred to in this clause (ii) to be true and correct,
                  individually or in the aggregate, has not had a Material

                  respects, in each case as of the date of this Agreement and as
                  of the Effective Date as though made on and as of the
                  Effective Date (except in the case of representations and
                  warranties that speak as of another date, in which case only
                  with reference to such other date), and the Vivendi Parties,
                  Sofiee and Canal shall have received a certificate of a senior
                  executive officer and a senior financial officer of Seagram to

                  not have occurred a Material Adverse Change to Seagram which
                  has not been cured; and

         (d)      the holders of Seagram Common Shares representing in excess of
                  9.9% of the outstanding Seagram Common Shares shall not have
                  exercised dissent or similar rights in connection with the
                  Arrangement.

(2)      None of the Vivendi Parties, Sofiee and Canal may rely on the failure
         to satisfy any of the above conditions precedent if the condition
         precedent would have been satisfied but for a material default by any
         Vivendi Party, Sofiee or Canal in complying with its obligations
         hereunder.

SECTION 5.3    ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF SEAGRAM.

(1)      The obligations of Seagram to complete the Arrangement shall also be
         subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions

         may only be waived by Seagram):

         (a)      each of the Vivendi Parties, Sofiee and Canal shall have
                  performed or complied in all material respects with all

         (b)      (i) the representations and warranties of the Vivendi Parties,
                  Sofiee and Canal set forth in this Agreement that are
                  qualified by Material Adverse Effect shall be true and

                  clause (ii) to be true and correct, individually or in the
                  aggregate, has not had a Material Adverse Effect on Vivendi or
                  Canal), and (iii) the representations and warranties of the
                  Vivendi Parties, Sofiee and Canal contained in Section
                  3.2(1)(a)(ii), 3.2(1)(b) and 3.2(2)(b) shall be true and

                  date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Date as though
                  made on and as of the Effective Date (except in the case of
                  representations and warranties that speak as of another date,
                  in which case only with reference to such other date), and
                  Seagram shall have received a certificate of a senior
                  executive officer and a senior financial officer of each of
                  Vivendi in respect of the Vivendi Parties, Sofiee and Canal to
                  such effect;

         (c)      the Vivendi Voting Rights relating to the Exchangeable Shares
                  shall entitle the beneficiaries thereof to have one vote per
                  such Vivendi Voting Right on the same basis and in the same
                  circumstances as one Vivendi Share;

         (d)      the Board of Directors of each Vivendi Party, Sofiee and Canal
                  shall have adopted all necessary resolutions, and all other
                  necessary corporate action shall have been taken by the
                  Vivendi Parties, Sofiee and Canal to permit the consummation
                  of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

         (e)      between the date hereof and the Effective Date, there shall
                  not have occurred a Material Adverse Change to Vivendi or
                  Canal which has not been cured;

         (f)      the orders referred to in Section 2.8(1) shall have been
                  obtained and the Exchangeable Shares shall have been
                  conditionally approved for listing as of the Effective Time on

                  Effective Date, from (i) Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, counsel

                  by this Agreement will be treated for U.S. income tax purposes
                  as constituting a transaction described in Section 351 of the
                  Code and that no gain or loss will be recognized by U.S.
                  shareholders of Seagram who exchange their shares of Seagram
                  for Vivendi ADSs (it being understood that the Vivendi
                  Parties, Sofiee, Canal and Seagram shall provide customary
                  representations upon which such tax counsel shall be entitled
                  to rely in rendering such opinion) and (ii) Osler, Hoskin &
                  Harcourt LLP, counsel to Seagram, to the effect that (A)
                  Canadian resident holders of Seagram Common Shares who elect
                  to receive Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the Plan of
                  Arrangement and who make a valid election under subsection
                  85(1) or 85(2) of the Canadian Tax Act will not generally
                  recognize gain or loss for purposes of the Canadian Tax Act
                  and (B) the Exchangeable Shares will not, at the date of
                  issue, be "foreign property" for purposes of the Canadian Tax
                  Act; and

         (h)      the Sofiee Resolution, including the election of the Seagram
                  Designees to the Board of Directors of the surviving entity of
                  the Sofiee Merger and the adoption of the Vivendi By-Laws,
                  shall have been approved.

(2)      Seagram may not rely on the failure to satisfy any of the above
         conditions precedent if the condition precedent would have been
         satisfied but for a material default by Seagram in complying with its
         obligations hereunder.

SECTION 5.4       NOTICE AND CURE PROVISIONS.

(1)      The Vivendi Parties, Sofiee and Canal, on the one hand, and Seagram, on
         the other hand, will give prompt notice to the other of the occurrence,
         or failure to occur, at any time from the date hereof until the
         Effective Date, of any event or state of facts which occurrence or
         failure would, or would be likely to:

         (a)      cause any of the representations or warranties of the other
                  party contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate such that
                  the conditions set forth in Section 5.2(b) or 5.3(b), as
                  applicable, would not be satisfied as of the Effective Date;
                  or

         (b)      result in the failure to comply with or satisfy any covenant
                  or agreement to be complied with such that the conditions set
                  forth in Section 5.2(a) or 5.3(a), as applicable, would not be
                  satisfied as of the Effective Date.

(2)      None of the Vivendi Parties, Sofiee, Canal or Seagram may rely upon any
         conditions precedent contained in Sections 5.1, 5.2 or 5.3, or exercise
         any termination right arising therefrom (except by the Vivendi Parties
         or Canal in respect of a breach of Sections 4.5 or by Seagram in
         respect of a breach of Section 4.6 or 4.7) unless forthwith and in any
         event prior to the filing of the Articles of Arrangement for acceptance
         by the Director, the Vivendi Parties, Sofiee and Canal, on the one
         hand, or Seagram, on the other hand, as the case may be, has delivered
         a written notice to the other specifying in reasonable detail all
         breaches of covenants, representations and warranties or other matters
         which the Vivendi Parties, Sofiee and Canal, on the one hand, and
         Seagram, on the other hand, as the case may be, are asserting as the
         basis for the non-fulfilment of the applicable condition precedent or
         the exercise of the termination right, as the case may be. If any such
         notice is delivered, provided that Seagram, on the one hand, or the
         Vivendi Parties, Sofiee and Canal, on the other hand, as the case may
         be, are proceeding diligently to cure such matter, if such matter is
         susceptible to being cured (for greater certainty, except by way of
         disclosure in the case of representations and warranties), the other
         may not terminate this Agreement as a result thereof until the earlier
         of the Outside Date and the expiration of a period of 60 days from such
         notice. If such notice has been delivered prior to the making of the
         application for the Final Order or the filing of the Articles of
         Arrangement with the Director, such application and such filing shall
         be postponed until the expiry of such period. For greater certainty, in
         the event that such matter is cured within the time period referred to
         herein without a Material Adverse Effect on the curing party, this
         Agreement may not be terminated as a result of the cured breach.

SECTION 5.5       SATISFACTION OF CONDITIONS.

         The conditions precedent set out in Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 shall be
         conclusively deemed to have been satisfied, waived or released when,
         with the agreement of Vivendi, Canal and Seagram, a certificate of
         arrangement in respect of the Arrangement is issued by the Director.


                                    ARTICLE 6
                            AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

SECTION 6.1       AMENDMENT.

         This Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement may, at any time and from
time to time before or after the holding of the Seagram Meeting, the Vivendi
Meeting or the Canal Meeting but not later than the Effective Date, be amended
by mutual written agreement of Vivendi (on behalf of the Vivendi Parties and
Sofiee), Canal and Seagram, and any such amendment may, subject to applicable
Laws and the Interim Order, without limitation:

         (a)      change the time for performance of any of the obligations or
                  acts of the parties;

                  warranty contained herein or in any document delivered
                  pursuant hereto;

         (c)      waive compliance with or modify any of the covenants herein
                  contained and waive or modify performance of any of the

         (d)      waive compliance with or modify any conditions precedent
                  herein contained;

provided, however, any such change, waiver or modification does not invalidate
any required security holder approval of the Arrangement.

SECTION 6.2       TERMINATION.

(1)      This Agreement may be terminated by Vivendi or Canal if Seagram shall
         be in material breach of any of its covenants or other agreements
         contained in this Agreement, which breach (A) would give rise to the
         failure of a condition set forth in Section 5.2(1)(a) and (B) has not
         been cured in accordance with Section 5.4.

(2)      This Agreement may be terminated by Seagram if the Vivendi Parties,
         Sofiee or Canal shall be in material breach any of its covenants or
         other agreements contained in this


                                      A-74
<PAGE>   78
         Agreement, which breach (A) would give rise to the failure of a
         condition set forth in Section 5.3(1)(a) and (B) has not been cured in
         accordance with Section 5.4.

(3)      This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective
         Date, by action taken or authorized by the Board of Directors of the
         terminating party or parties, and except as provided below, whether
         before or after approval of the matters presented at the Vivendi
         Meeting, the Canal Meeting or the Seagram Meeting:

         (a)      by the mutual agreement of Seagram and Vivendi (for greater
                  certainty, without further action on the part of the Seagram
                  Shareholders, Canal Shareholders or the Vivendi Shareholders
                  if terminated after the holding of the Seagram Meeting, Canal
                  Meeting or the Vivendi Meeting, as applicable);

         (b)      by either Seagram, Canal or Vivendi if any Governmental Entity
                  shall have passed any Law that makes consummation of the
                  transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or
                  otherwise prohibited or if any injunction, order or decree
                  enjoining any Vivendi Party, Sofiee, Canal or Seagram from
                  consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
                  is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction and such
                  injunction, order or decree shall become final and
                  non-appealable, provided that the right to terminate this
                  Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.2(3)(b) shall not be
                  available to the party seeking to terminate if any action of
                  such party or its affiliates or the failure of such party or
                  its affiliates to perform any of its obligations under this
                  Agreement required to be performed at or prior to the
                  Effective Time shall have resulted in such impediment to the
                  Closing having been imposed or having failed to be lifted;

         (c)      by Vivendi if (A) the Board of Directors of Seagram shall have
                  failed to recommend or shall have withdrawn, modified or
                  changed in a manner adverse to the Vivendi Parties or Canal
                  its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the
                  transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it being
                  understood and agreed that a communication by the Board of
                  Directors of Seagram to the Seagram Shareholders pursuant to
                  Rule 14d-9(f)(3) of the Exchange Act, or any similar type of
                  communication to the Seagram Shareholders in connection with
                  the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer,
                  shall not be deemed to constitute a withdrawal, modification
                  or change of its recommendation of this Agreement or the
                  transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or (B) the Board
                  of Directors of Seagram shall have approved or recommended any
                  Seagram Acquisition Proposal;

         (d)      by Seagram if (A) the Board of Directors of Vivendi or Canal
                  shall have failed to recommend or shall have withdrawn,
                  modified or changed in a manner adverse to Seagram its
                  approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the
                  transactions


                                      A-75
<PAGE>   79
                  contemplated by this Agreement or (B) the Board of Directors
                  of Vivendi or Canal shall have approved or recommended any
                  Vivendi Acquisition Proposal or any Canal Acquisition
                  Proposal, as the case may be;

         (e)      by Seagram or Vivendi if the Seagram Shareholder approval
                  shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to
                  obtain the vote required by the Interim Order at the Seagram
                  Meeting or any adjournment thereof at which the vote was
                  taken;

         (f)      by Vivendi, Canal or Seagram if the Vivendi Resolution shall
                  not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the
                  required vote at the Vivendi Meeting or any adjournment
                  thereof at which the vote was taken or if the Canal Resolution
                  shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to
                  obtain the required vote at the Canal Meeting or any
                  adjournment thereof at which the vote was taken;

         (g)      by Seagram if the Vivendi/Canal Agreements are terminated; or

         (h)      by Seagram if a Vivendi Acquisition Proposal is consummated or
                  a Canal Acquisition Proposal is consummated in each case,
                  prior to the Effective Date.

(4)      If the Effective Date does not occur on or prior to the Outside Date,
         then, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, either
         Vivendi, Canal or Seagram may terminate this Agreement, provided that
         in the event that the conditions set forth in Section 5.1(j) above
         shall not have been satisfied by that date, either Vivendi, Canal or
         Seagram may unilaterally extend the Outside Date until June 19, 2001
         upon written notice to the other by March 12, 2001, in which case the
         Outside Date shall be deemed for all purposes to be June 19, 2001,
         provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
         Section 6.2(4) shall not be available to the party seeking to terminate
         if any action of such party or its affiliates or the failure of such
         party or its affiliates to perform any of its obligations under this
         Agreement required to be performed at or prior to the Effective Time
         shall have resulted in the conditions contained in Sections 5.1 and
         Section 5.2 or 5.3 (as applicable) not having been satisfied prior to
         the Outside Date.

(5)      If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the foregoing
         provisions of this Section 6.2, no party shall have any further
         liability hereunder except as provided in Section 6.3 and as otherwise
         contemplated hereby, and provided that neither the termination of this
         Agreement nor anything contained in this Section 6.2(5) shall relieve
         any party from any liability for any willful and material breach by it
         of this Agreement.

SECTION 6.4       REMEDIES.

         The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that an award of money damages
         would be inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by any party or
         its representatives and any such breach would cause the non-breaching
         party irreparable harm. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that, in
         the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by one
         of the parties, the non-breaching party will also be entitled, without
         the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable
         relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance. Such
         remedies will not be the exclusive remedies for any breach of this
         Agreement but will be in addition to all other remedies available at
         law or equity to each of the parties (subject to Section 6.2(5) above).
