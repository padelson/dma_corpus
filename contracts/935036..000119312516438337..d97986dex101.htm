-v- TRANSACTION AGREEMENT

 

This Transaction Agreement (this " _Agreement_ "), dated January 20, 2016, is
between ACI Worldwide, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Seller_ "), and
Fiserv, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (" _Acquiror_ ").

RECITALS

 

1\. Seller is engaged, directly and indirectly through certain of its
Subsidiaries, in the Foxtail Business.

 

2\. Seller has determined to divest the Foxtail Business in the manner
contemplated hereby.

 

3\. Acquiror desires to purchase from Seller and its Subsidiaries, and Seller
desires to Convey or cause to be Conveyed to Acquiror, the Acquired Assets,
and Acquiror desires to assume from Seller and its Subsidiaries, and Seller
desires to assign or cause to be assigned to Acquiror, the Assumed
Liabilities, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions
hereinafter set forth.

Accordingly, the Parties agree as follows:

 

I. PURCHASE AND SALE

 

1.01 __Sale of Assets__. Except as provided in _Section 1.06_, effective as
of the Closing, Seller will sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver ("
_Convey_ ") (or will cause any applicable Subsidiary of Seller to Convey) to
Acquiror (or one or more Affiliates of Acquiror), and Acquiror (or one or more
Affiliates of Acquiror) will purchase from Seller, or a Subsidiary of Seller,
all of Sellers and its applicable Subsidiaries respective right, title and
interest in and to the Acquired Assets, free and clear of any Security
Interests other than Permitted Encumbrances.

1.02 __Assumption of Liabilities__. Effective as of the Closing, Seller will
assign (or will cause any applicable Subsidiary of Seller to assign) to
Acquiror (or one or more Affiliates of Acquiror), and Acquiror (or one or more
Affiliates of Acquiror) will assume, perform and fulfill when due and, to the
extent applicable, comply with, or will cause one or more of its Affiliates
to assume, perform and fulfill when due and, to the extent applicable, comply
with, all of the Assumed Liabilities, in accordance with their respective
terms.

 

1.03 __Misallocated Transfers__. (a) If, at any time from and after the
Closing, Seller (or any member of the Seller Group) discovers that it or any
of its Affiliates is the owner of, receives or otherwise comes to possess any
Acquired Asset or is liable for any Assumed Liability, Seller will promptly
Convey, or cause to be Conveyed, such Acquired Asset or assign, or cause to
be assigned, such Assumed Liability to Acquiror or an Affiliate thereof as
Acquiror may designate (and Acquiror will, and Acquiror will cause such
Affiliate thereof to, accept such Acquired Asset or assume, perform and
fulfill when due and, to the extent applicable, comply with, such Assumed
Liability). If,  at any time from and after the Closing, Acquiror (or any member of the
Acquiror Group) discovers that it or any of its Affiliates is the owner of,
receives or otherwise comes to possess any Excluded Asset or is liable for
any Excluded Liability, Acquiror will promptly Convey, or cause to be
Conveyed, such Excluded Asset or assign, or cause to be assigned, such
Excluded Liability to Seller or an Affiliate thereof (and Seller will,
and Seller will cause such Affiliate thereof to, accept such Excluded Asset
or assume, perform and fulfill when due and, to the extent applicable, comply
with, such Excluded Liability). Prior to any such Conveyance, the applicable
Assets will be held in trust for the benefit, insofar as reasonably possible,
of the Person entitled thereto (and at such Persons sole expense) until the
consummation of the Conveyance thereof.

 

(b) If at any time during the 12-month period immediately following the
Closing Date, Acquiror notifies Seller in writing of, or Seller otherwise
becomes aware of any Assets owned by Seller or its Subsidiaries that are not
Acquired Assets, but are reasonably necessary to operate the Foxtail Business
as conducted on the Closing Date (the " _Required Assets_ "), then to the
extent Seller or its Subsidiaries continue to own such Required Assets, Seller
will, subject to compliance with applicable legal or contractual limitations,
provide Acquiror or one of its Affiliates a non-exclusive license on terms and
subject to conditions mutually agreed, on a perpetual and fully-paid up
basis, to use the Required Assets in connection with the Foxtail Business.

 

1.04 __Acquired Assets__. (a) For purposes of this Agreement and subject to

the Closing (other than any such Assets that are Conveyed or otherwise

of _Section 4.01_ ):

Subsidiaries pursuant to, and associated with, (A) all Foxtail Contracts

following the date hereof and Acquiror has not rejected any

 



2  Contracts listed thereon within 7 days after receipt of such list
(collectively, the " _Foxtail Contracts_ "); provided further, however,
Acquiror may only reject a Contract if Acquiror determines in good faith that

reasonable discretion (including in the event there are unacceptable non-
compete, non-solicit, most favored nations or other similar provisions), or
was not entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business;

(iv) all Governmental Permits and all pending applications therefor that are
primarily used or held for primary use in the Foxtail Business (the " _Foxtail

(ix) all rights to causes of action, lawsuits, judgments, claims and demands

avoidance of doubt, the Excluded Liabilities will include the following
Liabilities:

(i) all Liabilities listed or described in _Section 1.05(b)(i)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter;

(ii) all Liabilities for Excluded Taxes;

 

(iii) all Liabilities to the extent relating to, resulting from or arising out
of any Excluded Asset, except to the extent expressly identified as Assumed
Liabilities in _Section 1.05(a)_;

(iv) all Liabilities that are expressly contemplated by this Agreement as
Liabilities to be retained or assumed by Seller or any other member of the
Seller Group, and all Liabilities of any member of the Seller Group under this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements;

 

(v) all Liabilities of Seller or its Subsidiaries arising by reason of any
violation or alleged violation of any Law or any other requirement of any
Governmental Authority, which violation or alleged violation occurred prior to
Closing;

(vi) all Liabilities of Seller or its Subsidiaries arising out of or related
to any breach or alleged breach by Seller or its Subsidiaries of any Contract,
in each case occurring at or prior to Closing, regardless of when any such
Liability is asserted;

 

(vii) Sellers or its Subsidiaries Liability for tort claims, known or
unknown, and any related claims and litigation based on acts or omissions at
or prior to the Closing, whether asserted prior to, on or after the Closing
Date;

 

(viii) the Sellers Liabilities relating to any Action arising out of or in
connection with the Foxtail Business or otherwise, or any other conduct of
Seller, its Subsidiaries or Sellers or any of its Subsidiaries respective
officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents or advisors on or prior to
the Closing Date; and

 

(ix) Sellers Liability relating to (A) In-Scope Employees who are offered
employment by Acquiror in accordance this Agreement but who decline to accept
such offer and (B) any employee of Seller or the Seller Group who is not a
Continuing Employee.

 



6 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, to the extent the facts,
circumstances, actions, inactions, ownership or use of the Acquired Assets,
or operation or conduct of the Foxtail Business, giving rise to a Liability
that would otherwise be an Excluded Liability continue following the Closing
such that there is additional Liability resulting from such facts,
circumstances, actions, inactions, continued ownership or continued use of the
Acquired Assets, or the continued operation or conduct of the Foxtail
Business, after the Closing, such Liability will constitute an
Excluded Liability to the extent the Liability relates to the period prior to
the Closing and will constitute an Assumed Liability to the extent of such
additional Liability from and after the Closing Date and will be allocated
between Seller and Acquiror on that basis. This _Section 1.05(c)_ is not in
any way intended, and it will in no event be deemed, to limit any rights of
any Acquiror Indemnitee to indemnification set forth in _Section 8.02(b)_ or
_8.02(c)_ and, subject to the preceding sentence, _Section 8.02(a)_, and an
Acquiror Indemnitees right to indemnification under such sections will
supersede a Seller Indemnitees right to indemnification under _Section
8.01(a)_ to the extent such indemnification rights are otherwise both
applicable.

1.06 __Certain Consents__. (a) Except as otherwise set forth in _Section
1.06(b)_, if and to the extent that the Conveyance to Acquiror of any Acquired
Asset or to the Seller Group of any Excluded Asset would be a violation of
applicable Laws or require any Consent in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby that has not been obtained as of the Closing, then,
notwithstanding any other provision hereof, such Conveyance will automatically
be deferred and will not occur until all legal impediments are removed
or such Consents have been obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such
Asset will still be considered an Acquired Asset or Excluded Asset, as
applicable, and the Person retaining such Asset will thereafter hold such
Asset in trust for the benefit, insofar as reasonably possible, of the Person
entitled thereto (and at such Persons sole expense) until the consummation of
the Conveyance thereof. The Parties will use their respective Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to develop and implement arrangements to place the Person
entitled to receive such Asset, insofar as reasonably possible and to the
extent not prohibited by applicable Law or the relevant Contract, in the same
position as if such Asset had been Conveyed as contemplated hereby such that
all the benefits and burdens relating to such Asset, including possession,
use, risk of loss, potential for gain, any Tax Liabilities in respect thereof
and dominion, control and command over such Asset, are to inure from and
after the Closing to such Person.

(b) If and to the extent that the Conveyance to Acquiror of any Foxtail
Facility or the sublease of any Real Property Lease to Acquiror or one of its
Subsidiaries would require any Consent in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby that has not been obtained as of the Closing, then, such
Conveyance or sublease will not occur at the Closing and such Foxtail
Facility and Real Property Lease will be deemed to be an Excluded Asset (each,
a " _Non-Transferred Facility_ "). Seller shall, or shall cause any applicable
Subsidiary to, provide to Acquiror or one of its Subsidiaries, access to and
use of such Non-Transferred Facility under the Transition Services Agreement
for a reasonable amount of time following the Closing in order to allow the
Foxtail Business to continue to operate uninterrupted and in the Ordinary
Course of Business and to enable Acquiror or its Subsidiary to find an
alternative facility satisfactory to Acquiror in Acquirors reasonable
discretion.

 



7 (c) From the date hereof until the earlier of the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, Seller will use its, and will cause its Subsidiaries to use
their, Commercially Reasonable Efforts to seek to remove any legal impediments
or secure any contractual Consents required from third parties to Foxtail
Contracts necessary to Convey such Foxtail Contracts to Acquiror or one of
its Affiliates. For purposes of _Section 1.06(c)_, the use of "Commercially
Reasonable Efforts" to secure any contractual Consents required from third
parties to Foxtail Contracts will require Seller and Acquiror to take the
actions set forth on _Section 1.06(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter. In
the event that Acquiror or any of its Affiliates has a pre-Closing contractual
relationship with any customer for which Consent is required and sought under
this _Section 1.06(c)_, then Acquiror will reasonably cooperate with Seller
in Sellers efforts to remove any legal impediments or secure any contractual
Consents with respect to such third parties. If and when the applicable legal
or contractual impediments are removed or the applicable Consents are
obtained, the Conveyance of the applicable Asset will be effected in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or such applicable Ancillary
Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 1.06_ will be deemed to (A) constitute
or require a waiver by any of the Parties of any of the closing conditions set
forth in _Article VI_ , including the receipt of the Governmental Approvals,
or (B) apply to any Shared Contract, it being understood that Shared
Contracts are governed by _Section 4.13_.

1.07  _ _Waiver of Bulk-Sales Laws__. Each of Seller and Acquiror hereby
waives compliance by each member of their respective Group with the
requirements and provisions of the "bulk-sale" or "bulk-transfer" Laws of any
jurisdiction that may otherwise be applicable with respect to the Conveyance
of any or all of the Assets to any member of the Seller Group or Acquiror
Group, as applicable.

 

1.08 __Consideration__. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary,
Acquiror and its Affiliates will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable under the terms of this Agreement such amounts
as are required to be deducted and withheld pursuant to all applicable Tax
Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror will provide reasonable notice
to Seller of any required withholding (unless such withholding is required as
a result of the failure of Seller to provide any documents required under
_Section 1.12_) and will reasonably cooperate with Seller in obtaining any
available exemption or reduction of such withholding. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Acquiror and its Affiliates under any provision of
this Agreement, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted to the applicable
Taxing Authority in accordance with applicable Law and (ii) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the recipients in
respect of which such deduction and withholding were made to the extent
such payments are remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority.

1.09 __Closing__. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the consummation of the Conveyance of the Acquired Assets and
the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities (the " _Closing_ ") will take place
at Jones Day, 222 East 41st Street, New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m., New
York City time, on the date

 



8  that is two Business Days immediately following the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that
by their nature or pursuant to the terms of this Agreement are to be
satisfied at or immediately prior to the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, where permitted, the waiver of those conditions). The date on
which the Closing occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_." For
accounting purposes, the Closing will be deemed to have occurred as of
11:59:59 pm local time on the Closing Date.

 

1.10 __Purchase Price__. (a) The aggregate purchase price to be paid to Seller
in full consideration of the Acquired Assets will be (i) the payment in cash
of (A) $200,000,000 (the " _Base Amount_ "), _plus_ or _minus_ , as the case
may be, (B) the Working Capital Overage or Working Capital Shortfall (such
aggregate amount, the " _Cash Purchase Price_ "), as applicable, and (ii) the
assumption by Acquiror or one or more of its Affiliates of the Assumed
Liabilities.

 

(b) Not later than five Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
Seller will provide to Acquiror its good faith estimate (the " _Estimated
Working Capital Closing Statement_ ") of (i) the Closing Working Capital and
(ii) the Cash Purchase Price. The Estimated Working Capital Closing Statement
will be prepared (A) in a manner and format consistent with the Sample
Working Capital Statement and (B) using the most current financial information
reasonably available to Seller in the Ordinary Course of Business that Seller
determines is reliable and appropriate for the relevant calculations.

(c) Acquiror will review the Estimated Working Capital Closing Statement and
if Acquiror disagrees with any item set forth therein, it will provide
written notice to Seller and Seller and Acquiror will attempt to resolve in
good faith any such disagreements prior to the Closing. If Seller and Acquiror
are unable to agree on the amounts set forth in the Estimated Working Capital
Closing Statement, the values proposed by Seller in the Estimated Working
Capital Closing Statement will be utilized for purposes of the payment of the
Estimated Cash Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 1.10(d)_ (the estimated
Cash Purchase Price set forth in the Estimated Working Capital Closing
Statement, as such amount may be modified pursuant to this _Section 1.10(c)_,
the " _Estimated Cash Purchase Price_ " and the estimated Closing Working
Capital set forth in the Estimated Working Capital Closing Statement, as such
amount may be modified pursuant to this _Section 1.10(c)_, the " _Estimated
Closing Working Capital_ "). If the Estimated Closing Working Capital is
greater than the Target Working Capital, then the amount of such excess (the
" _Working Capital Overage_ ") will be added to the Base Amount. If the
Estimated Closing Working Capital is less than the Target Working Capital,
then the amount of such shortfall (the " _Working Capital Shortfall_ ") will
be deducted from the Base Amount. In no event will the determination of the
amounts set forth in the Estimated Working Capital Closing Statement prejudice
either Partys rights under _Section 1.11_.

 



9 (d) At the Closing and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, in consideration of the Conveyance of the Acquired Assets,
Acquiror or its designated Affiliates will assume the Assumed Liabilities and
pay to Seller or its designated Affiliates in cash an amount equal to the
Estimated Cash Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to a bank account or accounts designated by Seller in writing not less than
two days prior to the anticipated Closing Date.

 

1.11 __Working Capital Adjustment__. (a) Within 60 days following the Closing
Date, Seller will prepare and deliver to Acquiror a statement setting forth
Sellers calculation (the " _Closing Working Capital Statement_ ") of (i) the
Closing Working Capital and (ii) the Cash Purchase Price. The Closing Working
Capital Statement will be prepared in a manner and format consistent with the
Estimated Working Capital Closing Statement. At the request of Seller,
Acquiror will provide to Seller and its accountants access during normal
business hours to the books and records and any other information, and to any
employees of Acquiror or any other member of the Acquiror Group, that in each
case Seller determines is reasonably necessary for Seller to prepare the
Closing Working Capital Statement, to respond to any Acquiror Objection and
to prepare materials for presentation to the Accounting Firm contemplated by
this _Section 1.11_, and Acquiror will otherwise cooperate with and assist
Seller as Seller may reasonably request to carry out the purposes of this 
_Section 1.11_.

(b) For a period of 60 days after delivery of the Closing Working Capital
Statement, Seller will provide Acquiror with reasonable access to all books,
records, personnel and other materials and sources used by Seller to prepare
the Closing Working Capital Statement and not already in the possession or
under the control of Acquiror to the extent reasonably related to the
determinations contemplated by this _Section 1.11_. The Closing Working
Capital Statement will be binding and conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by,
Acquiror unless Acquiror notifies Seller in writing within 60 days after
delivery of the Closing Working Capital Statement of any good faith objection
thereto (the " _Acquiror Objection_ "). Any Acquiror Objection must set forth
a description in reasonable detail of the basis of the Acquiror Objection and
the specific adjustments to the values reflected in the Closing Working
Capital Statement prepared by Seller which Acquiror believes should be made.
Any items not disputed during the foregoing 60-day period will be deemed
to have been accepted by Acquiror for all purposes of this Agreement.

(c) If Seller and Acquiror are unable to resolve any of their disputes with
respect to the Closing Working Capital Statement within 30 days following
Sellers receipt of the Acquiror Objection pursuant to _Section 1.11(b)_,
either Party may refer the remaining disputed items to Grant Thornton LLP
or another independent accounting firm mutually selected by Seller and
Acquiror (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") to make a written determination as to
each then-remaining disputed item, which written determination will be final
and binding on the Parties as to each such disputed item. The Accounting Firm
will act as an arbitrator and not an auditor or expert and will address only
those items that are in dispute. With respect to any item of the Closing
Working Capital Statement for which a determination is to be made by the
Accounting Firm, the Accounting Firm may only assign a value that is equal to
the value for such item claimed by either Party. The Parties will use their
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to have the Accounting Firm make its
determination within 30 days of being engaged. The costs of any dispute

 



10  resolution pursuant to this _Section 1.11(c)_, including the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm, will be shared equally by Seller and
Acquiror. The fees and disbursements of the Representatives of each Party
incurred in connection with their preparation of the Closing Working Capital
Statement and preparation or review of any Acquiror Objection, as applicable,
will be borne by such Party.

 

(d) The Closing Working Capital Statement will become final and binding on the
Parties upon the earliest of (i) if no Acquiror Objection has been given, the
expiration of the period within which Acquiror must make its objection
pursuant to _Section 1.11(b)_, (ii) the agreement in writing by Seller and
Acquiror that the Closing Working Capital Statement, together with any
modifications thereto agreed by Seller and Acquiror, is final and binding, and
(iii) the date on which the Accounting Firm issues its written determination
with respect to any dispute relating to such Closing Working Capital
Statement pursuant to _Section 1.11(c)_. The Closing Working Capital
Statement, when final and binding on all Parties pursuant to this _Section
1.11(d)_, and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court of competent
jurisdiction, is herein referred to as the " _Final Closing Working Capital
Statement_." The Cash Purchase Price as set forth in the Final Closing Working
Capital Statement is the " _Final Cash Purchase Price_."

 

(e) Within five Business Days following the determination of the Final Closing
Working Capital Statement, the Closing Working Capital Adjustment Payment
payable pursuant to this _Section 1.11(e)_ will be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account or accounts designated by Seller
or Acquiror, as applicable. The " _Closing Working Capital Adjustment
Payment_ " will be equal to the Final Cash Purchase Price _minus_ the
Estimated Cash Purchase Price. If the Closing Working Capital Adjustment
Payment is positive, then Acquiror will pay to Seller the Closing Working
Capital Adjustment Payment. If the Closing Working Capital Adjustment Payment
is negative, then Seller will pay to Acquiror the absolute value of the
Closing Working Capital Adjustment Payment.

 

1.12 __Closing Deliveries__. (a) _Documents To Be Delivered by Seller_. On
the Closing Date, Seller will deliver, or will cause its appropriate
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to deliver, to Acquiror all of the following
instruments (each duly executed by Seller or those of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates that are parties, as applicable):

Affiliates is a party;

(vii) a properly executed and completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 from

Security Interest, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror;

 

(ix) an assignment or sublease of Real Property Lease with respect to each
Foxtail Facility specified on  _Section 1.12(a)(ix)_ of the Seller

(x) the certificate contemplated by _Section 6.02(d)_.

 

(b) _Documents To Be Delivered by Acquiror_. On the Closing Date, Acquiror
will deliver, or will cause its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to deliver, as

applicable):

 

(i) the Ancillary Agreements to which Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates is a party;

 

(ii) the Transfer Documents as described in _Section 1.13_;

 

(iii) an assignment or sublease of Real Property Lease with respect to each

1.13 __Conveyance of Acquired Assets and Assumption of Assumed Liabilities__.
In furtherance of the Conveyance of the Acquired Assets and assumption of
Assumed Liabilities provided in _Sections 1.01_ and _1.02_ , on the Closing
Date, (a) Seller will execute and deliver, and will cause its Subsidiaries to
execute and deliver, such bills of sale, assignments of Contracts,
assignments of Intellectual Property, assignments of Assumed Liabilities and
other instruments of Conveyance (in each case to the extent applicable and in
a form that is consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
and otherwise customary or statutorily required in the jurisdiction in which
the relevant Assets are located) as and to the extent reasonably necessary to
evidence the Conveyance of all of Sellers and its Subsidiaries right, title
and interest in and to

 



12  the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities to Acquiror and its
Affiliates and (b) Acquiror will execute and deliver, or will cause to be
executed and delivered, such assumptions of Assumed Liabilities and other
instruments of assumption (in each case in a form that is consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, and otherwise customary or statutorily
required in the jurisdiction in which the relevant Liabilities are located)
as and to the extent reasonably necessary to evidence the valid and effective
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by Acquiror or its Affiliates. All of
the foregoing documents contemplated by this _Section 1.13_ will be referred
to collectively herein as the " _Transfer Documents_."

II. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

Seller hereby represents and warrants to Acquiror as of the date hereof and,
if Closing occurs, as of the Closing that, except as set forth in the Seller
Disclosure Letter (interpreted in accordance with _Section 10.13_):

2.01 __Due Organization, Good Standing and Corporate Power__. Seller is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. Seller and its Subsidiaries have
the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate the
Acquired Assets, to carry on the Foxtail Business as now being conducted and
to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is, or will be at Closing, a party and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Seller and each
of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, lease or operation of
the Acquired Assets or the nature of the Foxtail Business conducted by it
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing has not
been and would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Foxtail Business.

2.02 _Authorization of Agreement_. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by Seller and, if applicable, its
Subsidiaries, and the consummation by it and, as of the Closing, its
Subsidiaries of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been
or will be duly authorized and approved by all necessary corporate action and
no other corporate or shareholder action on the part of Seller or its
Subsidiaries is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is, or
will be at Closing, a party, or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
when executed, will be duly executed and delivered by Seller, and its
Subsidiaries (to the extent it is a party thereto), and each is (or when
executed will be) a valid and binding obligation of Seller and its applicable
Subsidiaries and enforceable against Seller and such applicable Subsidiary in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
similar Law affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by
general equitable principles (such exception, the " _Enforceability Exception_
").

 



13 2.03 __Consents and Approvals; No Violations__. Except as set forth in 
_Section 2.03_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter and assuming (a) the filings
required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as
amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), are made and the waiting periods thereunder have
been terminated or expired and any Governmental Approvals required under any
other Antitrust Law have been obtained or satisfied and (b) the Governmental
Approvals set forth in _Section 2.03_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter have
been made or obtained, the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements by Seller and, if applicable, its Subsidiaries, and the
consummation by Seller and, if applicable, its Subsidiaries of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will not (i) violate
or conflict with any provision of their respective Organizational Documents,
(ii) violate or conflict with any Law or Order of any Governmental Authority
applicable to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of the Foxtail
Business, (iii) require any Governmental Approval, or (iv) result in a
violation or breach of, conflict with, constitute (with or without due notice
or lapse of time or both) a default under or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration, or give rise to any obligation,
right of termination, cancellation, acceleration or increase of any obligation
or a loss of a material benefit under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any Foxtail Material Contract, excluding in the case of clauses
(ii) through (iv) above, conflicts, violations, approvals, breaches, defaults,
rights of terminations, cancellations, accelerations, increases or losses
which would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
be material to the Foxtail Business. The execution of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby will not result in the creation of any Security Interests
against the Seller, any of its Subsidiaries, the Acquired Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities.

 

2.04 __Intellectual Property__. (a) Seller or a Subsidiary of Seller has good,
valid and legal title to, and is the sole owner of all right, title and
interest in and to, the Foxtail Owned IP Assets, free and clear of any
Security Interests other than Permitted Encumbrances.

 

(b) The Foxtail IP Assets, together with the Seller Shared Technology and the
Intellectual Property used to provide the services pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement, include all of the rights to Intellectual Property that
are used by any member of the Seller Group in the operation of the Foxtail
Business as currently conducted, except for the Excluded IP Assets,
the Intellectual Property that is set forth in _Section 2.04(b)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, which is either Open Source Software or generally
commercially available, and the Intellectual Property that is licensed to a
member of the Seller Group pursuant to any of the Contracts that are listed
on _Section 2.07(a)(vi)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter but that are not
Foxtail Contracts. Notwithstanding whether the foregoing can be interpreted to
be a representation regarding non-infringement, misappropriation or other
violation of the Intellectual Property of third parties, such representation
will not be interpreted in such way and the only representation made by Seller
regarding infringement, misappropriation or other violation of the
Intellectual Property of third parties is set forth in _Section 2.04(d)_
below.

 



14 (c) _Section 1.04(a)(v)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of
the Foxtail Owned IP Assets that constitute active Registered Intellectual
Property as of the date hereof, including for each such item listed, as
applicable, its (i) territory, (ii) application serial number and date, (iii)
issue number and date, and (iv) title or mark. All registration, maintenance
and renewal fees, issue fees and annuities due to any Governmental Authority
in respect of such Foxtail Owned IP Assets as of the date hereof have been
paid.  _Section 1.04(a)(v)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter also lists
certain identifiers that could be deemed unregistered Trademarks. None of such
Foxtail Owned IP Assets is licensed to any third party, except pursuant to a
Foxtail Material Contract listed in _Section 2.07(a)(v)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter. Each such item of the Foxtail Owned IP Assets that is
issued or registered is valid and enforceable, and there is no pending Action
or allegation asserting the invalidity or unenforceability of any item of the
Foxtail Owned IP Assets other than prosecution proceedings entered into in the
Ordinary Course of Business with the applicable issuing or granting
Governmental Authority. There is no pending Action or allegation challenging
Sellers or its Subsidiaries ownership of the Foxtail Owned IP Assets. After
the Closing, the Acquiror will be able to enforce the rights in each such item
of the Foxtail Owned IP Assets that is issued or registered against
infringers thereof to the same extent that Seller or its Subsidiaries could do
if the assignment of such Foxtail Owned IP Assets contemplated hereby did not
take place.

 

(d) To Sellers knowledge after reasonable internal inquiry, neither Seller
nor any of its Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, directly, as a
contributory infringer, through inducement or otherwise), nor any of the
products and services offered by, on behalf of or through Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (whether by sale, license or otherwise), nor the use or licensing
of the Foxtail Software, nor any of the processes or business methods used by
or at the direction of Seller or its Subsidiaries in the Foxtail Business, nor
the operation of the Foxtail Business, in each case, as currently conducted by
Seller and its Subsidiaries, infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates
any Intellectual Property of any Person. For the avoidance of doubt, the
limitations of the defined term "Knowledge" are not intended to apply to
this  _Section 2.04(d)_.

(e) To Sellers Knowledge, there is not and has not been any unauthorized use
or disclosure, infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any
Foxtail Owned IP Assets or Foxtail Software by any Person. There has been no
claim made or threatened by Seller or its Subsidiaries against any Person (and
neither Seller nor its Subsidiaries has been a party to any Action including
such a claim) asserting any unauthorized use or disclosure, infringement,
misappropriation or other violation of any Foxtail Owned IP Assets or Foxtail
Software.

 

(f) Except as set forth in _Section 2.04(f)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
there has been no claim made in writing, or to the Knowledge of Seller,
threatened, against Seller or its Subsidiaries (and neither Seller nor its
Subsidiaries has been a party to any Action including such a claim), and
neither Seller nor its Subsidiaries has received or provided notice of any
such claim or other communication: (i) asserting the infringement,
misappropriation or other violation of any Intellectual Property; (ii)

 



15  challenging Sellers or its Subsidiaries ownership of or rights to use,
license or otherwise exploit any Intellectual Property or Foxtail Software;
(iii) asserting that Seller or its Subsidiaries has engaged in unfair
competition, false advertising or other unfair business practices; (iv)
offering an "invitation to license" as a means to avoid infringement or
potential infringement of any Intellectual Property; or (v) otherwise
asserting claims or allegations affecting or that would, if established,
affect the ability of Seller or its Subsidiaries or the Foxtail Business to
make, use, have made, offer to sell, sell, or import any product, software,
data or service developed, under development, made, used, sold, offered for
sale, or imported in any country, worldwide for the Foxtail Business, or the
ability to otherwise conduct the Foxtail Business as such business is
currently conducted by Seller and its Subsidiaries.

(g) Seller and its Subsidiaries have exercised reasonable care to protect the
confidential information and trade secrets of the Foxtail Business and to
protect the confidential information and trade secrets of others provided to
Seller or its Subsidiaries in connection with the Foxtail Business in
confidence.

 

(h) To Sellers Knowledge, Sellers and its Subsidiaries current and former

Section instead of this Section 4.02(a) following the Closing, and (ii)
except as otherwise provided in _Sections 1.06(b) and 4.02(b)-(c)_ , neither
Seller nor Acquiror will be required to make any non-de minimis payments,

in determining whether any Governmental Approvals under Antitrust Laws of
other jurisdictions are required or advisable to be obtained.

 



31 (c) _Efforts To Obtain Antitrust Approvals_. (i) Seller and Acquiror will each
use Commercially Reasonably Efforts to cause the termination of the waiting

assets or businesses, and will not include initiating, defending or otherwise
engaging in any litigation with a Governmental Authority, private party or

representation, warranty or covenant contained herein or relieve any Seller of
any obligations hereunder or under any Ancillary Agreement unless

might arise outside the Ordinary Course of Business; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding the provision of information or investigation by Seller,
Seller will not be deemed to make any representation or warranty except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A)
Seller will not be required to provide any information which it determines in
good faith it may not provide to Acquiror by reason of applicable Law
(including any information in confidential personnel files), or which Seller
determines in good faith constitutes information protected by attorney-client
or other similar privilege; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if any information
is so prohibited to be provided, Seller will use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to take those actions reasonably necessary so that Seller is able to
provide such information to Acquiror as promptly as possible and (B) Seller
will not be required to provide access to any of its properties in a manner
that will result in damage to such property or for the purpose of performing
any onsite procedure or investigation, without Sellers written consent,
which Seller may grant or deny in its discretion. Each of Seller and Acquiror
agrees that it will not, and will cause its respective Representatives not to,
use any information obtained pursuant to this _Section 4.05_ for any purpose

Information_. Except as otherwise provided in any Ancillary Agreement or as
prohibited by applicable Law, at any time after the Closing Date and until the
sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, each Party will provide or cause to be

Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, in each case other than in connection
with any dispute arising out of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. In
addition, Seller will provide or cause to be provided to Acquiror or the
Acquiror Group, as soon as reasonably practicable after written request
therefor, copies of any business records related to the Foxtail Business that
are not Foxtail Books and Records and to which Acquiror or a member of the
Acquiror Group reasonably needs access in connection with the Foxtail
Business. The Party requesting Information will reimburse the other Party for
the reasonable out-of-pocket costs, if any, of creating, gathering and
copying such Information, to the extent that such costs are incurred for the
benefit of the requesting Party.

 



34 (b) _Ownership of Information_. Any Information owned by a Party that is
provided to the other Party pursuant to this _Section 4.06_ remains the
property of the Party that owned and provided such Information. Each Party
will, and will cause members of their respective Groups to, maintain the
confidentiality of any Information provided pursuant to this _Section 4.06_
in accordance with _Section 4.12_ hereof.

4.07 __Privileged Communications__. As to all communications among counsel
for Seller or its Affiliates (including Jones Day and in-house counsel of
Seller and/or its Affiliates), Seller and any Affiliate of Seller that relate
in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to any
Excluded Assets, Excluded Liabilities or Excluded Business (collectively, the
" _Privileged Communications_ "), the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belongs to Seller and may be controlled by
Seller and will not pass to or be claimed by Acquiror or any of their
respective Affiliates. The Privileged Communications are the property of
Seller, and from and after the Closing none of Acquiror, any other Affiliate
of Acquiror or any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Acquiror
(including any Continuing Employee) or any other Affiliate of Acquiror will
seek to obtain such communications, whether by seeking a waiver of the
attorney-client privilege or through other means. Acquiror further agrees
that neither Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
successors or assigns may use or rely on any such Privileged Communications in
any Action against or involving any of the Parties after the Closing, and
Acquiror waives and will not assert, and agree to cause its Affiliates to
waive and not to assert, any attorney-client privilege with respect to such
Privileged Communication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between Acquiror or any of their Affiliates and a third party
(other than a Party or any of their respective Affiliates) after the Closing,
Acquiror may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure
of confidential communications by counsel for Seller or the Seller Group to
such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Acquiror nor any of
its Affiliates may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of
Seller.

terms of their employment Contracts with Acquiror or any Subsidiary of
Acquiror or hire any Continuing Employee; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this Section 4.08(a) will restrict or preclude Seller or any member
of the Seller Group from (i) making generalized solicitations of employees by
the use of media advertisement or by engaging employment search firms that
were not specifically instructed to solicit the Continuing Employees or (ii)
soliciting any Continuing Employees whose employment with Acquiror or
its Subsidiaries has been terminated by Acquiror or its Subsidiaries prior to
such solicitation by Seller or other members of the Seller Group.

 



35 (b) Acquiror agrees that during the Non-Solicit Period, Acquiror will not, and

employees substantially involved in the provision of services under the
Transition Services Agreement) (the " _Seller Non-Solicit Employees_ ") to
leave the employment of Seller or its Subsidiaries for employment with or
other engagement to provide services to Acquiror or its Affiliates, violate
the terms of their employment Contracts with Seller or any Subsidiary of
Seller or hire any such Seller Non-Solicit Employees;  _provided_ , _however_
, that nothing in this _Section 4.08(b)_ will restrict or preclude Acquiror

of the Acquiror Group.

directly or indirectly through any other employee or representative of the

any action to induce or attempt to induce, or assist anyone else to induce or
attempt to induce, any Person who has been a client or customer of the Foxtail
Business at any time during the twelve month period prior to the Closing Date,
with respect to the goods and services of the type supplied by the Foxtail
Business as of the Closing Date, to reduce or discontinue its business with
the Foxtail Business or disclose to any other Person who would be reasonably
likely to induce or attempt to induce any such customer to reduce or
discontinue its business with the Foxtail Business or the material terms of
any such customer relationship; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to

forth in _Section 4.10(d)_. Acquiror will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts
to transition from use of the Seller Names and Marks as soon as reasonably
practicable and in any event prior to expiration of the Transition Period.
Except as expressly provided in this _Section 4.10_, Seller reserves for
itself and its Affiliates all rights in the Seller Names and Marks, and no
other rights therein are granted to any member of the Acquiror Group or any of
their respective Affiliates, whether by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
All use of the Seller Names and Marks with respect to the Foxtail Business
will inure to the benefit of Seller and its Affiliates.

jurisdiction, Acquiror may continue to use the Seller Names and Marks in
connection with the Foxtail Business on the same materials and in
substantially the same manner as used by the Foxtail Business during the
90-day period preceding the Closing. In each applicable jurisdiction, as soon
as practicable following the Closing Date, and, in any event within 90 days
after the Closing Date, Acquiror will, and will cause the other members of the
Acquiror Group to, remove or irreversibly cover or modify all Seller Names and
Marks from or destroy any such other materials bearing any of the Seller
Names and Marks.

(d) Acquiror will, and will cause the other members of the Acquiror Group to
not use, any of the Seller Names and Marks after the Closing in any manner or
for any purpose other than in the same or substantially same manner that such
Seller Names and Marks were being used by the Foxtail Business during the
90-day period preceding the Closing.

 

(e) The license granted under this _Section 4.10_ may be terminated by
written notice if Acquiror is in material breach of any provision hereof that
remains uncured for more than ten days after written notice thereof from
Seller. Upon such termination of the license granted hereunder for any reason,
Acquiror and its Affiliates will not use any of the Seller Names and Marks. 

 



37 4.11 __Insurance Matters__. From and after the Closing, Acquiror will not,
and will cause its Affiliates not to, assert any claim against any insurance
policies or practices of Seller and its Affiliates under any captive insurance
policies, fronted insurance policies, surety bonds or corporate insurance
policies or practices, or any form of self-insurance whatsoever; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) Seller and Acquiror agree that all claims with respect to
insured events occurring prior to the Closing will be administered in
accordance with the terms of Sellers or its Subsidiaries third-party
policies, if any, and coverage applicable to such claims, (b) Acquiror will
receive the benefit of such third-party policies with respect to such claims
to the extent losses occurring prior to the Closing related to Acquired
Assets are covered notwithstanding the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (c) Seller will receive the benefit of
such policies with respect to such claims to the extent losses related to
Excluded Liabilities are covered notwithstanding the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and provided that in the case of
clauses (b) and (c) such recovery will be net of any deductibles or self-
insured retention amounts, costs of any retroactive insurance premiums or
other amounts paid or expenses incurred in connection with any insured claims
made after the Closing under any such policies that relate to the period prior
to Closing or any amounts paid by Seller pursuant to _Article VIII_ in
respect of the applicable Liabilities (it being understood that Seller will
have the right to determine whether or not to make any claim against Sellers
insurance policies).

 

4.12 __Confidentiality__. (a) Prior to the Closing, Acquiror will, and will
cause its Representatives to, treat all nonpublic information obtained in
connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby as confidential in accordance with the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
are hereby incorporated by reference and will continue in full force and
effect until the Closing.

(b) The Parties acknowledge that in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Parties have disclosed and will disclose
to each other Information which the Parties consider proprietary and
confidential (" _Confidential Information_ "). The Parties agree that, after
the Closing, Information that constitutes an Acquired Asset or Assumed
Liability will be Confidential Information of Acquiror, and Acquiror will not
be subject to this _Section 4.12(b)_ with respect to such information, and
Seller will be deemed to be the Receiving Party of such Confidential
Information for purposes of this _Section 4.12(b)_. Each Party receiving
Confidential Information (the " _Receiving Party_ ") agrees that:

(i) any Confidential Information disclosed by the other Party (the "
_Disclosing Party_ ") will be received and held in confidence by the
Receiving Party and that such Receiving Party will not, without the prior
written consent of the Party from whom such Confidential Information was
obtained disclose, divulge or permit any Person to obtain any Confidential
Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party (whether or not such
Confidential Information is in written or tangible form), other than to
Subsidiaries of the Receiving Party and their employees and agents, in each
case, who have a need to know such Confidential Information and who are bound
by duties of confidentiality and non-use obligations with respect to such
Confidential Information no less protective of the Disclosing Party than those
set forth herein;

 



38 (ii) the Receiving Party will take such steps as may be reasonably necessary
to prevent the disclosure of Confidential Information to others and will
treat the Confidential Information in all material respects in the same way
that it treats its own non-public proprietary information, but in any case
using no less than a reasonable degree of care; and

(iii) the Receiving Party will use the Confidential Information only in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement to perform its and its Groups obligations or to exercise
its rights under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

 

(c) The commitments set forth above will not extend to any portion of
Confidential Information (i) which is already known to the Receiving Party or
is or was independently developed by the Receiving Party without using any
Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party (other than any member of
Seller Group with respect to Confidential Information related to the Foxtail
Business), (ii) which is or becomes generally available to the public other
than as a result of an act or omission by the Receiving Party, (iii) which
corresponds in substance to any Information furnished to the Receiving Party
on a non-confidential basis by any third party not known to be subject to any
confidentiality obligation with respect thereto, or (iv) which is required to
be disclosed by Law; _provided_ , that with respect to any Information
required to be disclosed by Law, the Receiving Party provides reasonable
prior written notice of such required disclosure to the Disclosing Party
following the Receiving Partys knowledge of such requirement in order to
provide the Disclosing Party with an opportunity to prevent or limit such
disclosure by seeking a protective Order or other appropriate remedy at the
sole expense of the Disclosing Party.

 

4.13 __Shared Contracts__. (a) (i) _Section 4.13(a)(i)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, correct and complete list of the Shared
Contracts between Seller or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the customers
listed on _Section 2.21(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, on the other
hand, existing as of the date of this Agreement, and (ii) _Section
4.13(a)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, correct and
complete list of the Shared Contracts between Seller or its Affiliates, on the
one hand, and third party vendors of the Foxtail Business, on the other hand,
existing as of the date of this Agreement.

(b) Within thirty days following the date hereof, Seller will provide to
Acquiror a true, correct and complete list setting forth (i) the Shared
Contracts between Seller and its Affiliates and the remaining customers of the
Foxtail Business not listed on _Section 2.21(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter and (ii) the Shared Contracts between Seller and its Affiliates and any
third party vendors of the Foxtail Business not listed on _Section
4.13(a)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

 



39 (c) Acquiror will have the right to notify Seller, within seven days after
Acquirors receipt of (i) the complete list of Shared Contracts provided
pursuant to _Section 4.13(b)_ and (ii) complete and accurate copies of the
Shared Contracts set forth on such list, which additional Shared Contracts, if
any, it rejects, and such rejected Shared Contracts will not be subject to
the provisions of _Section 4.13(d)_ and will be Excluded Assets retained by
Seller or its Subsidiaries. All other Shared Contracts included on the list
delivered to Acquiror pursuant to _Section 4.13(b)_ will be treated in
accordance with _Section 4.13(d)_.

(d) During the period after the date hereof until the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, Seller will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause (i)
each Shared Contract listed in _Section 4.13(a)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter to be assigned in relevant part to a member of the Acquiror Group or
to appropriately amend such Shared Contract so that Acquiror or another member
of the Acquiror Group will, from and after the Closing, be entitled to the
rights and benefits inuring to the Foxtail Business under such Shared
Contracts, and Seller and Acquiror will, and will cause the respective members
of their Group to, use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts to negotiate a
mutually acceptable arrangement under which Acquiror (or another member of
the Acquiror Group) or Seller (or another member of the Seller Group) will,
from and after the Closing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the
relevant Shared Contract, obtain the benefits and assume the Liabilities
and obligations under such Shared Contract to the extent related to the
Foxtail Business (in the case of the Acquiror Group) or the Excluded
Businesses (in the case of the Seller Group), including entering into sub-
contracting, sub-licensing or sub-leasing arrangements for the benefit of
Acquiror or Seller, as the case may be; (ii) each Shared Contract identified
under the heading "Partial" in _Section 4.13(a)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter to be assigned, subcontracted or sublicensed to Acquiror to the extent
necessary to enable Acquiror to meet its contractual obligations, as set forth
in the customer Foxtail Contracts, including customer support, maintenance and
other similar obligations, after the Closing, and (iii) each Shared Contract
identified under the heading "Full" in _Section 4.13(a)(ii)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter to be replicated such that Acquiror or another member of the
Acquiror Group and the third party to such Shared Contract will sign a
Contract identical to the Contract between Seller or its Affiliate and such
third party so that Acquiror or another member of the Acquiror Group will,
from and after the Closing, be entitled to the same rights and benefits
inuring to Seller or its Affiliate under such Shared Contracts (collectively,
the " _Sharing Arrangements_ "). From and after the Closing and until the
Sharing Arrangements are agreed and effective, Seller will use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to develop and implement arrangements to place Acquiror or
its Subsidiaries, insofar as reasonably possible and to the extent not
prohibited by applicable Law or the relevant Contract, in the same position as
if such relevant part of such Shared Contract or the entirety of such Shared
Contract, as the case may be, had been assigned to Acquiror or its Subsidiary
such that all the benefits and burdens relating to such relevant part of the
Shared Contract or the entirety of such Shared Contract, as the case may be,
including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain and any Tax
Liabilities in respect thereof inure from and after the Closing to such Person
and the Parties will reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to the
dominion, control and command over such Shared Contract or portion thereof
from and after the Closing. The foregoing rights of Acquiror with respect to
such Shared Contracts will be deemed to be Acquired Assets hereunder. Seller
will provide Acquiror

 



40 with contact information for such third parties and introduce representatives
of the Acquiror Group to Sellers contacts at such third parties. For
purposes of _Section 4.13(d)_, the use of "Commercially Reasonable Efforts"
to secure any contractual Consents required from third parties to Shared
Contracts will require Seller and Acquiror to take the actions set forth on
_Section 4.13(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the expiration or other
termination of any Shared Contract, neither Acquiror nor Seller will be
obligated to continue the Sharing Arrangements, as applicable; _provided_ ,
that neither Seller nor Acquiror may terminate any such Shared Contract
without the prior written consent of the other Party.

(f) Any out-of-pocket costs of obtaining the consent of the relevant
counterparty to the arrangements contemplated by this _Section 4.13_,
including any payment or fee required to be made to such counterparty in
exchange for the grant of such Consent, will be paid by Seller.

 

4.14 __No Solicitation or Negotiation__. Seller agrees that, from the date of
this Agreement to the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement, it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
officers, employees, Affiliates, agents and representatives not to, directly
or indirectly (i) take any action to initiate, solicit, entertain, negotiate,
accept, discuss, respond to any inquiry with respect to, or encourage any
Proposal or proposal that would reasonably be expected to result in a
Proposal, (ii) furnish to any other Person (other than Acquiror and
its Representatives) any information relating to the Foxtail Business or in
connection with any Proposal, or take any other action to facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably
be expected to result in, a Proposal or (iii) enter into any contract,
agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to a Proposal or
otherwise requiring Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to, or contemplating
that Seller or any of its Subsidiaries will, abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Seller will immediately
advise Acquiror if Seller, the Subsidiaries or any of their respective
officers, employees, Affiliates, or Representatives receives a Proposal or
similar inquiry in writing and the terms thereof.

V. EMPLOYEE MATTERS

 

5.01 __Identification of Employees__. Seller will update the list of In-Scope
Employees set forth on  _Section 5.01_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter from
time to time in Sellers sole discretion in order to reflect terminations,
transfers and new hires in the Ordinary Course of Business and accidental or
inadvertent errors or omissions, highlighting such changes, to Acquiror and
will provide a final version of such list of In-Scope Employees at least two
Business Days prior to Closing.

 

5.02 __Employment Offers__. No later than fifteen Business Days following the
date of this Agreement, Acquiror will, or will cause one of its Subsidiaries
to, make an offer of employment, effective as of the Closing, to each In-Scope
Employee. Seller agrees to provide Acquiror with the information necessary to
comply with Acquirors obligations under this  _Section 5.02_. Each In-Scope
Employee who accepts employment with Acquiror or one of its Subsidiaries
immediately following the Closing is referred to herein as a " _Continuing
Employee_."

 



41 5.03 __Terms of Employment__. (a) _Compensation and Benefits_. During the
12-month period that begins as of the Closing, Acquiror will, or will cause
one of its Subsidiaries to, provide each Continuing Employee with (i)
compensation (including base salary, commissions, annual bonus opportunities
and equity incentive opportunities) and employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and employee
benefits offered to similarly situated employees of the Acquiror Group and
(ii) severance benefits at least as favorable as those provided to similarly-
situated employees of the Acquiror Group under the severance plans and
policies of Acquiror. To the extent that an In-Scope Employee is absent from
work as a result of a disability or leave of absence, Acquiror will not be
obligated to provide an offer of employment to such In-Scope Employee until
such time as the In-Scope Employee returns to active employment. If such In-
Scope Employee returns to active employment on or prior to the Closing
Date, Acquiror will make an offer of employment to such In-Scope Employee to
be effective as of the Closing. If such In-Scope Employee fails to return to
active employment by Closing, Acquiror will have no obligation to provide an
offer of employment under this _Section 5.03_.

(b) _Welfare Plans_. Coverage for all Continuing Employees and their
respective spouses and dependents under the Compensation and Benefit Plans
that are welfare benefit plans (" _Seller Welfare Plans_ ") will cease to be
effective as of immediately prior to the Closing Date. Seller and the Seller
Welfare Plans will be liable for all claims incurred with respect to
Continuing Employees and their spouses and dependents prior to the Closing
Date. Acquiror will cause welfare benefit plans sponsored by Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries (" _Acquiror Welfare Plans_ ") to provide coverage and benefits
for all Continuing Employees and their respective eligible spouses and
dependents effective on the Closing Date. Acquiror and the Acquiror Welfare
Plans will be liable for all claims incurred with respect to Continuing
Employees and their eligible spouses and dependents on and after the Closing
Date. For purposes of this _Section 5.03(b)_, a claim will be deemed
"incurred" on the date that the event that gives rise to the claim occurs
(for purposes of life insurance, severance, sickness, accident and disability
programs) or on the date that treatment or services are provided (for purposes
of health care programs). To the extent permitted by applicable Law, and
except where such treatment cannot be reasonably accommodated under any
applicable Acquiror Welfare Plan that is a life insurance plan, Acquiror will
cause each Acquiror Welfare Plan to (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and service conditions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to Continuing Employees,
other than limitations that were in effect with respect to such Continuing
Employees as of the Closing Date under the corresponding Seller Welfare Plan,
(ii) honor any payments, charges and expenses of such Continuing Employees
(and their eligible dependents) that were applied toward the deductible and
out-of-pocket maximums under the corresponding Seller Welfare Plan
in satisfying any applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums or co-
payments under a corresponding Acquiror Welfare Plan during the same plan year
in which such payments, charges and expenses were made, and (iii) waive any
waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would
otherwise be applicable to a Continuing Employee following the Closing Date to
the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation under the
corresponding Seller Welfare Plan. 

 



42 (c) _U.S. 401(k) Plan_. Acquiror will take all actions necessary so that,
effective as of the Closing Date, the Continuing Employees in the U.S. will
be eligible to participate in one or more Tax-qualified defined contribution
retirement plans sponsored by Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries (the "
_Acquiror 401(k) Plan_ "). 

(d) _Retention Arrangements_. Effective as of the Closing, Acquiror will, or
will cause one of its Subsidiaries to, assume all remaining obligations of
the Seller Group under the employee retention arrangements listed on _Section
5.03(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter to the extent the financial
obligations related to such retention arrangements are reflected in the Final
Closing Working Capital Statement.

(e) _Earned Vacation_. Except where otherwise provided by applicable Law, in
connection with the Closing, Seller and its Subsidiaries will pay out to each
Continuing Employee the amount of accrued and unpaid hours of vacation,
personal and sick leave applicable to such Continuing Employee as of the
Closing, except and solely to the extent of any accrual therefor set forth in
the Final Closing Working Capital Statement.

5.04 __Credit for Service with Seller__. Where applicable, Acquiror and its
Affiliates will provide credit for each Continuing Employees length of
service with Seller and its Affiliates for all purposes (including
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual) under each plan, program, policy or
arrangement of Acquiror and its Affiliates to the same extent such service was
recognized under a similar plan, program, policy or arrangement of Seller or
any of its Affiliates and for all purposes under applicable Law, except that,
in each case, such prior service credit will not be required to the extent
that it results in a duplication of benefits provided by Seller (including any
duplication of benefits under a defined benefit pension plan).

 

5.05 __COBRA__ _._ Acquiror and its Subsidiaries will assume and be
responsible for all Liabilities and obligations under Section 4980B of the
Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and any similar state or
local Laws with respect to any "qualifying event" (within the meaning of
Section 4980B of the Code) of any In-Scope Employees or their eligible
dependents occurring on or after the Closing Date.

5.06 ____Workers  Compensation_ ___. Effective as of the Closing, Acquiror
and its Subsidiaries will assume and be responsible for all workers 
compensation benefits payable to or on behalf of the Continuing Employees with
respect to any events, illnesses, injuries or conditions arising on or after
the Closing Date, including any illnesses, injuries or conditions arising on
or after the Closing Date that are aggravations or reinjuries of illnesses,
injuries or conditions arising prior to the Closing Date.

5.07 __WARN Act__. Acquiror will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, (a)
provide any required notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act or any other similar Law (the " _WARN Act_ ") and (b)
otherwise comply with the WARN Act with

 



43  respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act)
or group termination or similar event affecting Continuing Employees
(including as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements) and occurring from and after
the Closing.

 

5.08 __Cooperation__. Following the date of this Agreement, Seller (and its
Subsidiaries) and Acquiror (and its Subsidiaries) will reasonably cooperate
and use Commercially Reasonable Efforts in all matters reasonably necessary to
effect the transactions contemplated by this _Article V_ , including
exchanging information and data as permitted by applicable Law, reasonably
necessary for Seller or Acquiror to comply with the covenants contained in
this _Article V_.

5.09  _ _No Third-Party Beneficiaries__. Nothing herein express or implied by
this Agreement will confer upon any In-Scope Employee, or legal representative
thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or
benefits for any specific period, of any nature or kind whatsoever, under or
by reason of this Agreement. Without limiting Acquirors obligations under
this _Article V_ with respect to the Continuing Employees, this _Article V_
will not (i) constitute or be treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to
amend any employee benefit plan in which Sellers, Acquirors, or any of their
respective Affiliates employees participate or (ii) prohibit Acquiror or
any of its Subsidiaries from amending any employee benefit plan in which
Acquirors or such Subsidiarys employees participate.

6.04 __Frustration of Conditions__. Neither Seller nor Acquiror may rely on
the failure of any condition set forth in  _Section 6.01_, _Section 6.02_
or _Section 6.03_, as the case may be, to be satisfied to excuse it from its
obligation to effect the transactions contemplated hereby if such failure was
caused by such Partys breach of its obligations under this Agreement.

VII. TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT

 

7.01 __Basis for Termination__. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Closing
Date:

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Acquiror;

 

(b) by either Seller or Acquiror:

 

(i) if the Closing does not occur on or prior to June 30, 2016 or such later
date upon which the Parties may agree in writing (the " _End Date_ "), unless
the failure of the Closing to occur by such date is due to the failure of the
Party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe in all
material respects the covenants of such Party set forth herein; or

(ii) if (A) there is any Law that makes consummation of the transactions
hereunder illegal or otherwise prohibited (other than those having only an
immaterial effect and that do not impose criminal Liability or penalties) or
(B) any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction has issued an
Order or taken any other action (which the terminating Party must have
complied with its obligations hereunder to resist, resolve or lift)
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting any material
component of the transactions contemplated hereunder, and such Order or other
action becomes final and non-appealable;

(c) by Seller:

 

(i) if Acquiror breaches any of its representations and warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach (A) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.01_ or _Section 6.03_ and
(B) cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) days after the giving
of written notice to Acquiror of such breach; or

(ii) if any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.01_ or _Section 6.03_
becomes incapable of fulfillment, and has not been waived by Seller to the
extent waivable.

 



46 (d) by Acquiror:

 

(i) if Seller breaches any of its representations and warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement, which breach (A) would give rise to the failure
of a condition set forth in _Section 6.01_ or _Section 6.02_ and (B) cannot
be or has not been cured within thirty (30) days after the giving of written
notice to Seller of such breach; or

(ii) if any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.01_ or _6.02_ becomes
incapable of fulfillment, and has not been waived by Acquiror to the extent
waivable.

_provided_ , _however_ , that the Party seeking termination pursuant
to clause (c)(i), (c)(ii), (d)(i) or (d)(ii) is not in material breach of any
of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement.

 

7.02 __Notice of Termination; Return of Documents; Continuing Confidentiality
Obligation__. In the event of a termination of this Agreement by Seller or
Acquiror pursuant to this _Article VII_, written notice thereof will be given

notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Confidentiality Agreement
will be deemed to be reinstated and will be deemed to apply as if it had not
originally been terminated pursuant to  _Section 10.03_.

7.03 __Effect of Termination__. If this Agreement is duly terminated and
the transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in this
_Article VII_, this Agreement will become void and of no further force and
effect, except for the provisions of _Section 4.03_ relating to publicity, 
_Section 7.02_, this _Section 7.03_, _Article X_ and _Article XI_
containing general provisions and definitions, respectively, except that
nothing in this _Article VII_ will be deemed to release any Party from any
Liability for any material breach by such Party of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement or to impair the right of any Party to compel specific
performance by another Party of its obligations under this Agreement that
specifically survive such termination as set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence.

 



47 VIII. INDEMNIFICATION

 

8.01 __Indemnification by Acquiror__. Without limiting or otherwise affecting
the indemnity provisions of any Ancillary Agreement, but subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_ , from and after the Closing
Date, Acquiror will indemnify, defend (or, where applicable, pay the defense
costs for) and hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees from and against any and
all Losses that result from or arise out of, whether prior to or following the
Closing, any of the following items (without duplication):

 

(a) any Assumed Liability, including the failure of Acquiror, any other member
of the Acquiror Group or any other Person to pay, perform, fulfill, discharge
and, to the extent applicable, comply with, in due course and in full, any
such Assumed Liability;

(b) any breach by Acquiror or any other member of the Acquiror Group of any
covenant to be performed by such Persons pursuant to this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement; and

 

(c) any breach of any of the representations and warranties contained in
_Article III_ of this Agreement.

 

8.02 __Indemnification by Seller__. Without limiting or otherwise affecting
the indemnity provisions of any Ancillary Agreement but subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_ , from and after the Closing,
Seller will indemnify, defend (or, where applicable, pay the defense costs
for) and hold harmless the Acquiror Indemnitees from and against any and all
Losses that result from, relate to or arise out of, whether prior to or
following the Closing, any of the following items (without duplication):

 

(a) any Excluded Liability, including the failure of Seller or any other
member of the Seller Group or any other Person to pay, perform, fulfill,
discharge, and, to the extent applicable, comply with, in due course and in
full, such Excluded Liabilities;

(b) any breach by Seller or any other member of the Seller Group of any
covenant to be performed by such Persons pursuant to this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement;

 

(c) any breach of any of the representations and warranties of Seller
contained in _Article II_ of this Agreement; and

 

(d) any Excluded Litigation Matters.

 

8.03 __Insurance Relating to Indemnity Payments__. (a) _Insurance_. The
amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this _Article
VIII_ will be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnitee or its
Affiliates under third-party insurance policies with respect to such Loss
(less the cost to collect the proceeds of such insurance). If the Indemnitee
or its Affiliates actually receive a full or partial recovery under such
insurance policies following payment of indemnification by the Indemnifying
Party in respect of such Loss, then the Indemnitee will refund amounts
received from the Indemnifying Party up to the amount of indemnification
actually received from the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Loss (less
the cost to collect the proceeds of such insurance).

 



48 (b) _Items Included in the Final Closing Working Capital Statement_.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, Acquiror will have no right to
make any claims against Seller in respect of any Liability (i) to the extent
that the Liability was reflected in the Final Closing Working Capital
Statement, (ii) to the extent it would result in a duplicative payment or
benefit to Acquiror of amounts recovered as a Closing Working Capital
Adjustment Payment pursuant to _Section 1.11(e)_, or (iii) to the extent that
the claim arises out of facts or circumstances that were specifically
negotiated or resolved via arbitration in the working capital adjustment
process in _Section 1.11_.

 

8.04 __Procedures for Defense, Settlement and Indemnification of Claims__. (a)
_Direct Claims_. All claims made hereunder by (i) any member of the Seller
Group, on the one hand, against Acquiror or any member of the Acquiror Group,
on the other hand, or (ii) by any member of the Acquiror Group, on the one
hand, against Seller or any member of the Seller Group, on the other hand
(collectively, " _Direct Claims_ "), will be subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Article VIII_. If an Indemnitee receives notice or otherwise
learns of any matter that may be the subject of a Direct Claim, such
Indemnitee will give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof but
in any event within 30 days after receiving such notice or otherwise learning
of such matter. Any such notice will describe the matter in reasonable
detail, stating the nature, basis for indemnification and the amount thereof,
to the extent known, along with copies of any relevant documents evidencing
such matter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delay or failure of
any Indemnitee or other Person to give notice as provided in this _Section
8.04(a)_ will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this
_Article VIII_, except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is
actually and materially prejudiced by such delay or failure to give notice.

(b) _Third-Party Claims_. (i) _Notice of Claims_. If an Indemnitee receives
notice or otherwise learns of the assertion by a Person (including any
Governmental Authority) which is not a member of the Seller Group or the
Acquiror Group of any claim, including any demand or request for
indemnification or of the commencement by any such Person of any Action with
respect to which an Indemnifying Party would be obligated to provide
indemnification assuming the Person making such claim or commencing such
Action prevails in such claim or Action (collectively, a " _Third-Party
Claim_ "), such Indemnitee will give such Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice (a " _Claims Notice_ ") thereof but in any event within 30 days after
becoming aware of such Third-Party Claim. Any such notice will describe the
Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail, stating the nature, basis for
indemnification and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies
of any relevant documents evidencing such Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the delay or failure of any Indemnitee or other Person to give
notice as provided in this _Section 8.04(b)(i)_ will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this  _Article VIII_, except to
the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced
by such delay or failure to give notice.

 

(ii) _Opportunity to Defend_. (A) The Indemnifying Party will accept or
decline its obligation to defend by written notice to the Indemnitee (the "
_Defense Notice_ ") within 30 days after receipt of a Claims Notice from the
Indemnitee of the commencement or assertion of any Third-Party Claim in
respect of which indemnity 

 



49  may be sought under this _Article VIII_. If the Indemnifying Party accepts
its obligation to defend, it will assume and conduct the defense of such
Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee and will expressly agree with the
Indemnitee in writing to be fully responsible for all of the Losses that arise
from the Third-Party Claim, subject to the limitations thereon set forth in
this _Article VIII_. Notwithstanding the foregoing and at Indemnitees
election, the Indemnifying Party will not be entitled to control, but may
participate in, and the Indemnitee will be entitled to have sole
control, including the right to select defense counsel, over the defense or
settlement of any Third-Party Claim that (1) relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation, (2) seeks (and continues to seek) any relief other than
monetary damages, including a temporary restraining order, a preliminary or
permanent injunction or specific performance, (3) if the third party were to
prevail in such Third-Party Claim, would result in a precedent that would
materially interfere with, or have a material adverse impact on the business
or financial condition of the Indemnitee, or (4) would reasonably be expected
to materially exceed the Cap. If a Third-Party Claim consists of multiple
claims by a plaintiff or group of plaintiffs, and it is reasonably practicable
for an Indemnifying Party to control the defense of a subset of such claims,
the Indemnifying Party may elect to agree to be fully responsible subject to
the limitations thereon set forth in this _Article VIII_ , for only all of the
Losses that arise from such subset of claims, and may elect to control the
defense of only such subset of claims; _provided_ , that the
Indemnifying Party is otherwise permitted to defend such claim hereunder.

(B) In the event that the Indemnifying Party fails to give the Defense Notice
accepting its obligation to defend a Third-Party Claim or shall decline to
defend a Third-Party Claim, (1) the Indemnitee will be entitled to have
control over such defense and settlement of the subject claim and the
Indemnifying Party will be liable for the reasonable and documented costs,
including defense costs and judgment or settlement amounts paid or incurred in
connection therewith, (2) the Indemnifying Party will cooperate with and make
available to the Indemnitee such assistance and materials as it may
reasonably request, and (3) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right at its
expense to participate in the defense assisted by counsel of its own choosing.

 

(C) If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim
as provided in this _Section 8.04(b)_, (1) the Indemnitee will have the
right at its expense to participate in the defense assisted by counsel of its
own choosing, (2) the Indemnifying Party must conduct the defense of the
Third-Party Claim in good faith, and (3) the Indemnifying Party will not be
liable for any legal expenses incurred by the Indemnitee after receipt of the
Defense Notice in connection with the defense of the Third-Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnitee
based on the advice of counsel, there exists an actual or potential conflict
of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee with respect to
such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitee may assume its own defense, and the
Indemnifying Party will be liable for all reasonable costs or expenses
thereafter incurred in connection with such defense. The Indemnifying Party,
if it has assumed the defense of any Third-Party Claim as provided in this
Agreement, may not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee,
consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any

 



50  such Third-Party Claim unless such settlement or judgment (w) includes as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the
Indemnitee of a complete release from all Liability in respect of such Third-
Party Claim, (x) does not impose injunctive or other non-monetary equitable
relief against the Indemnitee or its Affiliates, or their respective
businesses, (y) does not include a finding or admission of any violation of
Law or any violation of the rights of any Person on the part of the Indemnitee
and (z) imposes monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying
Party. For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnified Party will have no
Liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of any Third Party
Claims effected without its consent when such consent is required hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with the defense of any Third-
Party Claim, Seller will have the right to assert, prosecute and settle any
counter-claims or affirmative defenses of the Seller Group.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 8.04_ will not apply to any
claim related to Tax matters, which will be governed exclusively by _Article
IX_.

 

8.05 __Additional Matters__. (a) _Cooperation in Defense and Settlement_.
With respect to any Third-Party Claim for which Acquiror, on the one hand,
and Seller, on the other hand, may have Liability under this Agreement or any
of the Ancillary Agreements, the Parties agree to cooperate fully and maintain
a joint defense (in a manner that will preserve the attorney-client
privilege, joint defense or other privilege with respect thereto) so as to
minimize such Liabilities and defense costs associated therewith. The Party
that is not responsible for managing the defense of such Third-Party
Claims will, upon reasonable request, be consulted with respect to
significant matters relating thereto and may retain counsel to monitor or
assist in the defense of such claims at its own cost.

 

(b) _Certain Actions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this _Article VIII_ , Seller will have exclusive authority and control over
the investigation, prosecution, defense and appeal of any Excluded Litigation
Matters; _provided_ , _however_ , that, (i) Seller will defend or prosecute,
as applicable, such Actions in good faith, (ii) Seller will reasonably
consult with Acquiror on a regular basis with respect to strategy and
developments with respect to any such Action, (iii) Acquiror will have the
right to participate in (but not control) the defense or prosecution, as
applicable, of such Action, and (iv) Seller must obtain the written consent of
Acquiror, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, to settle or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment
with respect to such Action if Seller is a defendant and such settlement,
consent or judgment would require Acquiror to abandon its rights, change its
business practices or incur any Liabilities with respect thereto or otherwise
would impose injunctive or other non-monetary equitable relief affecting the
Acquired Assets, Assumed Liabilities or the Foxtail Business.

(c) _Mitigation_. In respect of any Loss for which indemnification may be
sought pursuant to _Article VIII_ , the Indemnitee will (and will cause its
Affiliates to) use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts as required by Law to
mitigate any Losses upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably
be expected to, or does, give rise thereto.

 



51 (d) _Substitution_. In the event of an Action that involves solely matters
that are indemnifiable and in which the Indemnifying Party is not a named
defendant, if either the Indemnitee or the Indemnifying Party so requests, the
Parties will endeavor to substitute the Indemnifying Party for the named
defendant. If such substitution or addition cannot be achieved for any reason
or is not requested, the rights and obligations of the Parties regarding
indemnification and the management of the defense of claims as set forth in
this _Article VIII_ will not be affected. 

(e) _Subrogation_. In the event of payment by or on behalf of any Indemnifying
Party to or on behalf of any Indemnitee in connection with any Third-Party
Claim, such Indemnifying Party will be subrogated to and will stand in the
place of such Indemnitee, in whole or in part based upon whether the
Indemnifying Party has paid all or only part of the Indemnitees Liability,
as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnitee may
have any right, defense or claim relating to such Third-Party Claim against
any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third-Party Claim or against any
other Person. Such Indemnitee will cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in
a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of such Indemnifying Party,
in prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or claim.

 

8.06 __Exclusive Remedy__. From and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive
remedy of a Party with respect to any and all claims relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than
claims of, or causes of action arising from, Fraud, and except for seeking
specific performance or other equitable relief to require a Party to perform
its obligations under this Agreement to the extent permitted hereunder and
thereunder and except as otherwise provided herein or in any Ancillary
Agreement) will be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this  _Article VIII_ or, in the case of indemnification for Taxes, _Article
IX_.

8.07 __Limitations on Indemnification__. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if the Closing occurs, (i) Seller will not have any
Liability under _Section 8.02(c)_ (other than with respect to a breach of 
_Sections 2.01 _(Organization), _2.02_ (Authorization), _2.12_ (Brokers)
and _2.13_ (Title) (collectively, the " _Seller Specified Representations_ ")
and _2.04_ (Intellectual Property)) unless the aggregate Liability for Losses
suffered by the Acquiror Indemnitees thereunder exceeds $2,000,000 (the "
_Deductible_ ") and then only to the extent of such excess, (ii) Sellers
aggregate Liability under  _Section 8.02(c)_ (other than with respect to a
breach of any of the Seller Specified Representations) will not exceed
$20,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "), (iii) (A) Acquiror will not have any Liability
under  _Section 8.01(c)_ (other than with respect to a breach of _Sections
3.01_ (Organization), _3.02_ (Authorization) and _3.04_ (Brokers)
(collectively, the " _Acquiror Specified Representations_ ")) unless the
aggregate Liability for Losses suffered by the Seller Indemnitees thereunder
exceeds the Deductible, and then only to the extent of such excess, and (B)
Acquirors aggregate Liability under  _Section 8.01(c)_ (other than with
respect to a breach of any of the Acquiror Specified Representations) will not
exceed the Cap, and (iv) no Party will have any Liability under _Section
8.01(c)_ or _8.02(c)_ , as applicable, for any Loss arising out of any
individual claim (or any series of claims arising out of substantially the
same events, facts or circumstances, which will be aggregated for purposes of
this clause (iv)), unless such 

 



52  Loss exceeds $25,000, and any Losses that are disregarded pursuant to this
clause (iv) will not be aggregated for purposes of the preceding clauses (i)
through (iii). This  _Section 8.07_ will not apply to indemnification for
Taxes, which will be governed exclusively by _Article IX_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, neither the Deductible, nor the Cap will
apply to any Losses arising from any acts of Fraud.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein or elsewhere to the contrary,
all "material" or similar materiality type qualifications contained in the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement will be taken into
account for purposes of determining whether any representation or warranty has
been breached, but in the event that such representation and warranty has
been determined to have been breached, such qualification as to materiality
will thereafter be ignored and not given any effect for purposes of
determining the amount of Losses arising from such breach and
determining whether the thresholds in this _Section 8.07_ have been
surpassed.

8.08 __Tax Treatment of Indemnification__. For all Tax purposes, Acquiror and
Seller agree to treat any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price, except to the extent otherwise required
by applicable Law.

 

8.09 __Tax Indemnification Provisions__. For the avoidance of doubt, all Tax
related indemnification matters will be provided exclusively pursuant to
_Article IX_ hereof, unless _Section 9.06(c)_ expressly provides that such
Section relates to Tax indemnification matters.

 

IX. TAX MATTERS

9.01  _ _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns__. (a) Seller will prepare and
timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns
required to be filed in respect of the Acquired Assets and the Foxtail
Business for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Acquiror will prepare and timely
file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns required to be
filed solely in respect of the Acquired Assets or the Foxtail Business for a
Straddle Period. Any Tax Return required to be filed in respect of a Straddle
Period will be prepared on a basis consistent with (x) except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law, the past practices of the Seller Group
and (y) applicable Law. Acquiror will deliver to Seller, at least 15 days
prior to the due date for the filing of such Straddle Period Tax Return
(taking into account any applicable extensions), a statement setting forth the
amount of Tax for which Seller is responsible pursuant to _Sections 9.03(a)_
, _9.03(b)_ and _9.03(c)_ and a copy of such Tax Return, together with any
additional information relating thereto that Seller may reasonably request.
Seller will have the right to review such Straddle Period Tax Return,
statement and additional information, if any, prior to the filing of such Tax
Return, and Acquiror will reflect on such Tax Return any reasonable comments
submitted by Seller at least five days prior to the due date of such
Tax Return. Neither Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates will file an amended
Tax Return, or agree to any waiver or extension of the statute of limitations
relating to Taxes with respect to, the Acquired Assets or the Foxtail Business
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period, in each case, without the
prior written consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



53 (b) Seller will pay or cause to be paid all Taxes due with respect to Tax
Returns which Seller is obligated to prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, pursuant to _Section 9.01(a)_, and, at least five days
prior to the due date for a Tax Return in respect of a Straddle Period, Seller
will pay its portion of the Taxes due with respect to such Tax Return to
Acquiror, as determined pursuant to _Section 9.03(c)_.

9.02  _ _Refunds__. Seller will be entitled to any refund or Refund
Equivalent received with respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the
Acquired Assets or the Foxtail Business for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any such amounts arising by reason of
amended Tax Returns or any claim for a refund of Taxes filed after the Closing
Date), and to the extent any such refund or Refund Equivalent is received by
Acquiror or any member of the Acquiror Group, Acquiror will pay to Seller the
amount of such refund or Refund Equivalent (including interest received from
any Taxing Authority with respect to such refund or Refund Equivalent) within
ten days of receipt thereof, provided however, that Acquiror will be entitled
to retain any such refund or Refund Equivalent (or to the extent received by
Seller or any member of the Seller Group, receive payment from Seller with
respect thereto) to the extent included on the Final Closing Working Capital
Statement. Acquiror will be entitled to any refund or Refund Equivalent
received with respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Acquired
Assets or the Foxtail Business for a Tax period beginning after the Closing
Date. Acquiror and Seller will equitably apportion any refund or Refund
Equivalent (including interest received from any Taxing Authority with respect
to such refund or Refund Equivalent) received with respect to Taxes imposed on
or with respect to the Acquired Assets or the Foxtail Business for a Straddle
Period in a manner consistent with the principles set forth in _Section
9.03(c)_.

 

9.03 __Tax Indemnification__. (a) Seller will indemnify, defend and hold
Acquiror and its Affiliates harmless from and against all (i) Excluded Taxes,
(ii)Transfer Taxes for which Seller is responsible pursuant to _Section
9.05_, (iii) Taxes resulting from or arising in connection with any breach by
Seller of any representation or warranty contained in _Section 2.11_ or
covenant in _Article IX_ of this Agreement, and (iv) costs and expenses,
including reasonable legal fees and expenses, attributable to any item in
clauses (i) through (iii);  _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller will not be
required to indemnify Acquiror for any Excluded Taxes to the extent such
Excluded Taxes are the result of a breach by Acquiror or any of its Affiliates
of any covenant in this Agreement. Subject to _Section 9.06(c)_, Sellers
obligation to indemnify, defend or hold harmless Acquiror or any of its
Affiliates from any Excluded Taxes pursuant to this _Section 9.03(a)_ will
terminate effective 60 days following the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (including extensions).

(b) Acquiror will indemnify, defend and hold Seller and its Affiliates
harmless from and against all (i) Property Taxes that are allocable to the
portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date as determined
in accordance with 

 



54   _Section 9.03(c)_, (ii) Transfer Taxes for which Acquiror is responsible
pursuant to _Section 9.05_, (iii) Taxes resulting from or arising in
connection with any breach by Acquiror of any covenant in _Article IX_ of
this Agreement, and (iv) costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees
and expenses, attributable to any item in clauses (i) through (iii),
_provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror will not be required to indemnify
Seller for any such amounts to the extent such amounts are the result of a
breach by Seller or any of its Affiliates of any covenant in this Agreement.
Subject to _Section 9.06(c)_, Acquirors obligation to indemnify, defend or
hold harmless Seller or any of its Affiliates from Taxes pursuant to this
_Section 9.03(b)_ will terminate effective 60 days following the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations (including extensions).

(c) In the case of any Straddle Period, Property Taxes and similar periodic
Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Acquired Assets and the Foxtail
Business that are allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date will be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Straddle Period. The remainder of the Property
Taxes with respect to such Straddle Period are allocable to the portion of
the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date.

(d) Any indemnity payment required to be made pursuant to this  _Section
9.03_ will be made within 30 days after the Indemnitee makes written demand
upon the Indemnifying Party, but in no case earlier than five Business Days
prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes are required to be paid to the
applicable Taxing Authority.

(e) If a claim or other Tax Proceeding is made or initiated by any Taxing
Authority (a " _Tax Claim_ ") which, if successful, could result in an
indemnity payment pursuant to _Section 9.03_, the Party receiving notice of
such Tax Claim will promptly notify the other Party in writing of such claim
(and provide copies of any documents received from the Taxing Authority in
respect of such claim) no later than thirty (30) days after such Tax Claim is
made; _provided_ , that failure to provide such notice will not relieve such
other Party of its indemnification obligations except to the extent that such
other Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. With
respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or otherwise
relating to, or affecting, a Consolidated Tax Return, Seller will control, at
its own expense, all proceedings and may make all decisions taken in
connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel), and, without
limiting the foregoing, may, in its sole discretion, pursue or forego any
and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with
any Taxing Authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion,
either pay the applicable Liability for Taxes and sue for a refund or contest
the Tax Claim;  _provided_ , _however_ that with respect to any Tax Claim
relating to a Tax Return other than a Consolidated Tax Return that could
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on Acquiror or any of its
Affiliates that is material, Seller will not settle any such Tax Claim
without the prior written consent of Acquiror, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



55 (f) Acquiror will control all Tax Claims with respect to Straddle Period Tax
Returns  _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror will not settle, compromise
or abandon any such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Seller,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For
the avoidance of doubt, Acquiror will control all Tax Claims with respect to
Taxes of or with respect to the Acquired Assets or the Foxtail Business for
any Tax Period beginning after the Closing Date.

 

9.04 __Allocation of Cash Purchase Price__. Within 90 days after the
finalization of the Closing Working Capital Statement, Acquiror will prepare
and deliver to Seller an allocation of the Cash Purchase Price and the Assumed
Liabilities among the Acquired Assets in accordance with Code Section 1060 and
any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Law as appropriate (the "
_Purchase Price Allocation_ "). Seller will timely and properly prepare,
execute, file and deliver all such documents, forms and other information as
Acquiror may reasonably request to prepare such Purchase Price Allocation.
Seller will have thirty days to review and comment on the Purchase Price
Allocation. If Seller does not provide written comments within thirty days of
delivery of the Purchase Price Allocation, or if all disagreements are
otherwise resolved between Seller and Acquiror, such Purchase Price
Allocation will be final and binding on the Parties, and (i) Seller and
Acquiror will not, and will cause their respective Affiliates not to, take a
position in any forum that is inconsistent with such Purchase Price
Allocation, including taking an inconsistent position on any Tax Return,
before any Taxing Authority, or in any action relating to any Tax, except as
required by Law, (ii) Seller and Acquiror will file IRS Form 8594 and all
other Tax Returns in accordance with the Purchase Price Allocation, and (iii)
Seller and Acquiror will provide each other promptly with any additional
information necessary to complete IRS Form 8594. If Seller and Acquiror
are not able to resolve all objections, then each of the Parties will
allocate the Cash Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities among the
Acquired Assets in the manner each such Party determines is appropriate.

 

9.05 __Transfer Taxes__. Seller and Acquiror will each pay, and be responsible
for, 50% of all Transfer Taxes. Any Tax Return required to be filed with
respect to any such Transfer Taxes will be filed by the Person primarily
responsible for such filing under applicable Law; _provided_ , that such Party
will deliver a draft of any such Tax Return to the other Party at least 15
days prior to the due date for the filing of any such Tax Return (taking into
account any applicable extensions) and any additional information relating
thereto that the other Party may reasonably request, and will reflect on the
applicable Tax Return any reasonable comments submitted by such other Party at
least five days prior to the applicable due date. If required by applicable
Law, such other Party will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns. The Parties will reasonably cooperate in
obtaining any available exemptions or refunds with respect to Transfer Taxes.

 

9.06 __Miscellaneous__. (a) Each Party will provide the other with such
information, records and other assistance, and make such of its officers,
directors, employees and agents available, as may reasonably be requested by
the other Party in connection with any Tax matter under this _Article IX_,
including the preparation of any Tax Return and the conduct of any Tax Claim;
_provided_ that Acquiror will not be permitted to inspect or otherwise review
any Consolidated Tax Return.

 



56 (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) Seller will prepare
and file or will cause to be prepared and filed, and none of Seller or any of
its Affiliates will be required to provide any Person with, any Consolidated
Tax Return or copy of any Consolidated Tax Return and (ii) Seller will have
the exclusive right to control in all respects any Tax Claim as well as any
other Tax Proceeding with respect to any Consolidated Tax Return.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, indemnification for any
and all Tax matters, and the procedures with respect thereto, will be governed
exclusively by this _Article IX_ , and the provisions of _Article VIII_
(except for _Sections 8.06_ , _8.08_ , and _8.09_ ) will not apply. The
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 2.11_ will survive the
Closing Date until 60 days following the expiration of the relevant statute of
limitations (including extensions); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right
to be indemnified with respect to any matter set forth in _Section 9.03_ for
which notice was provided prior to the expiration of the relevant statute of
limitations will survive until such matter is fully resolved.

X. MISCELLANEOUS

 

10.01 __Survival of Representations and Warranties__. The representations and
warranties of Seller and Acquiror contained in this Agreement (other than the
Seller Specified Representations, Acquiror Specified Representations and the
representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 2.04_ (Intellectual
Property) and _2.10_ (Taxes)) will survive the Closing until the date that is
18 months after the Closing Date. The Seller Specified Representations and the
Acquiror Specified Representations will survive the Closing until such time as

bond or similar instrument.

with respect to such representation. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Acquiror agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that Jones
Day may represent Seller in any litigation, arbitration, mediation or other

Agreement or Ancillary Agreements). Seller hereby guarantees to Acquiror the
performance of the other members of the Seller Group of their respective
obligations under this Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements, and
