CERTIFICATES   SECTION 3.01 Conversion of Shares   At the Effective time,
by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, Company or the holders of any of the following securities:   (a) each
share of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of Company ("COMPANY COMMON
STOCK") issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time
(excluding those held in the treasury of Company and those owned by any
wholly owned Subsidiary of Company) and all rights in respect thereof, shall,
forthwith cease to exist and be converted into and become exchangeable for
0.41 of a share (the "EXCHANGE RATIO") of common stock, $.001 par value,
of Parent ("PARENT COMMON STOCK");   (b) each share of Company Common Stock
held in the treasury of Company or owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired
and no shares of stock or other securities of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other corporation shall be issuable, and no payment of
other consideration shall be made, with respect thereto;   (c) each issued
and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into
and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation; and   (d) from and after the Effective Time, each
outstanding certificate theretofore representing shares of Merger Sub common
stock shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence ownership of and to
represent the number of shares of Surviving Corporation common stock into
which such shares of Merger Sub common stock shall have been converted.  
SECTION 3.02 Exchange of Shares Other than Treasury Shares   (a) Exchange
Agent. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with a
bank or trust company to act as exchange agent for the Merger (the "EXCHANGE
AGENT") as may be designated by Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable to
Company.   (b) Parent to Provide Common Stock and Cash. Promptly after the
Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for
the benefit of the holder of Company Common Stock: (i) certificates of Parent
Common Stock ("PARENT CERTIFICATES") representing the number of whole shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 3.01(a) in exchange for
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately   
7              prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) sufficient
funds to permit payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
3.04.   (c) Exchange Procedures. The Exchange Agent shall mail to
each holder of record of certificates of Company Common Stock
("COMPANY CERTIFICATES"), whose shares were converted into the right to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 3.04) promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
no later than three Business Days after the later to occur of the Effective
Time and receipt by Parent of a complete list from Company of the names and
addresses of its holders of record): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Company Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt of the Company
Certificates by the Exchange Agent, and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify); and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates in exchange for
Parent Certificates (and cash in lieu of fractional shares). Upon surrender
of a Company Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
Parent Certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III
and payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 3.04, and the Company Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, each
outstanding Company Certificate that, prior to the Effective
Time, represented shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed from and
after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes other than the payment
of dividends and distributions, to evidence the ownership of the number of
full shares of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Common
Stock shall have been so converted and the right to receive an amount in cash
in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section
3.04. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no interest will
be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Company Certificates
pursuant to the provisions of this Article III.   (d) Distributions With
Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Certificate with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the
holder of record of such Company Certificate shall surrender such Company
Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar laws,
following surrender of any such Company Certificate, there shall be paid to
the record holder of the Parent Certificates issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of any such
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable (but for the provisions of this Section 3.02(d)) with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.   (e) Transfer of Ownership.
If any Parent Certificate is to be issued in a name other than that in which
the Company Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it
will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Company Certificate so
surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to
Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes   
8              required by reason of the issuance of a Parent
Certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of
the registered holder of the Company Certificate surrendered, or established
to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has
been paid or is not payable.   (f) Termination of Exchange Agent Funding.
Any portion of funds (including any interest earned thereon) or Parent
Certificates held by the Exchange Agent which have not been delivered to
holders of Company Certificates pursuant to this Article III within six
months after the Effective Time shall promptly be paid or delivered, as
appropriate, to Parent, and thereafter holders of Company Certificates who
have not theretofore complied with the exchange procedures outlined in and
contemplated by this Section 3.02 shall thereafter look only to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) only as general
creditors thereof for their claim for shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions (with a record date after the Effective Time) with respect to
Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled.   (g) No Liability.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.02, none of the
Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable
to any person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock or cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.   (h) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Company
Certificates. In the event any Company Certificates shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, a Parent Certificate
representing such shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares) as may be required pursuant to this Article III; provided,
however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Certificates to indemnify Parent against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect
to the Company Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed.   SECTION 3.03 Stock Transfer Books   (a) At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of Company shall each be closed, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common
Stock thereafter on the records of any such stock transfer books. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the stock transfer records of Company at the Effective
Time, a certificate or certificates representing the number of full shares of
Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Common Stock shall have
been converted shall be issued to the transferee together with a cash payment
in lieu of fractional shares, if any, in accordance with Section 3.04 hereof,
and a cash payment in the amount of dividends, if any, in accordance with
Section 3.02(d) hereof, if the certificate or certificates representing such
shares of Company Common Stock is or are surrendered as provided in Section
3.02(c) hereof, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence of payment of any applicable stock transfer
tax.    9                 (b) Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, certificates surrendered for exchange by any person
constituting an Affiliate of Company shall not be exchanged until Parent
shall have received from such person an affiliate letter as provided in
Section 7.03.   SECTION 3.04 No Fractional Share Certificates   No scrip
or fractional share Parent Certificate shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Company Certificates, and an outstanding fractional share
interest shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote, to receive dividends or
to any rights of a stockholder of Parent or of Surviving Corporation with
respect to such fractional share interest. As promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent an
amount in cash, rounded to the nearest whole cent, sufficient for the
Exchange Agent to pay each holder of Company Common Stock an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share
interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such
holder) by (ii) the closing price for a share of Parent Common Stock on
the NNM on the first Business Day immediately prior to the Effective Time. As
soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to
be paid to holders of Company Common Stock with respect to any fractional
share interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts, net of
any required withholding Taxes, to such holders of Company Common Stock,
subject to and in accordance with the terms of Section 3.02 hereof.  
SECTION 3.05 Options to Purchase Company Common Stock   At the Effective
Time, the Company Stock Plan and each option granted by Company to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company Stock Plan ("COMPANY
STOCK OPTIONS") which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be assumed by Parent, and the Company Stock Options
shall be converted into an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock
in such number and at such exercise price as provided below and otherwise
having the same terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (except to the extent that such terms, conditions and
restrictions may be altered in accordance with their terms as a result of the
Merger contemplated hereby and except that all references in each such
Company Stock Option to Company shall be deemed to refer to Parent):   (a)
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be subject  to the new option
shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of  shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the original Company Stock  Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (y) the Exchange  Ratio;   (b) the exercise price per
share of Parent Common Stock under  the new option shall be equal to (x) the
exercise price per share of  Company Common Stock in effect under the
original Company Stock Option  immediately prior to the Effective Time
divided by (y) the Exchange  Ratio; and   (c) in effecting such assumption
and conversion, the aggregate  number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be
subject to each assumed  Company Stock Option   
10                 will be rounded down, if necessary, to the
next whole share and the  aggregate exercise price shall be rounded up, if
necessary, to the next  whole cent.   The adjustments provided herein with
respect to any options that are "incentive stock options" (as defined in
Section 422 of the Code) shall be effected in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. The assumption of the outstanding
Company Stock Options in the Merger and their conversion into options for
Parent Common Stock will not result in any accelerated vesting of those
options or the shares purchasable thereunder, and the vesting schedule in
effect for each Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall remain in full force after the assumption thereof by Parent.  
SECTION 3.06 Unvested Stock   At the Effective Time, any unvested shares of
Company Common Stock awarded to employees, directors or consultants pursuant
to any of the Company\'s plans or arrangements and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into unvested shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with the Exchange Ratio and shall remain subject
to the same terms, restrictions and vesting schedule as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time. All outstanding rights which Company may hold
immediately prior to the Effective Time to repurchase unvested shares of
Company Common Stock shall be assigned to the Parent in the Merger and shall
thereafter be exercisable by Parent upon the same terms and conditions in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the shares
purchasable pursuant to such rights and the purchase price payable per share
shall be adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio.   SECTION 3.07 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan   At the Effective Time, the Company Stock Purchase Plan
and each outstanding purchase right under the Company Stock Purchase Plan
shall be assumed by Parent. Section 3.07 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true and complete list as of the date hereof of all holders of
outstanding purchase rights under the Company Stock Purchase Plan, including
the payroll deduction amount elected by each holder and the price per share
of Company Common Stock at the start of the current purchase periods. On the
Closing Date, Company shall deliver to Parent an updated version of such
schedule, current as of such date. Each such purchase right so assumed by
Parent under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the
terms and conditions set forth in the Company Stock Purchase Plan and the
documents governing the outstanding purchase rights under the Company Stock
Purchase Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the
purchase price of shares of Parent Common Stock and the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued upon the exercise of each such purchase
right shall be adjusted in accordance with the Exchange Ratio (with the
number of shares rounded down to the nearest whole share and the purchase
price rounded up to the nearest whole cent). The assumed outstanding purchase
rights under the Company Stock Purchase Plan shall be exercised at such times
following the Effective Time as set forth in the Company Stock Purchase Plan,
and each participant shall, accordingly, be issued shares of Parent
Common Stock at such times. The Company Stock Purchase Plan, and all
outstanding purchase rights thereunder, shall terminate with the exercise of
the last assumed purchase right, and no additional   
11              purchase rights shall be granted under the
Company Stock Purchase Plan following the Effective Time.   SECTION 3.08
Certain Adjustments   If between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, (i) the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of
any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination or exchange of
shares, or any dividend payable in stock or other securities shall be
declared thereon with a record date within such period, or (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock on a fully diluted basis is in excess of that
specified in Section 4.03 and disclosed in Section 4.03 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (regardless of whether such excess is a result of an
additional issuance of capital stock or a correction to such Sections) other
than changes caused by issuances of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Company Stock Purchase Plan, then the Exchange Ratio established pursuant to
the provisions of Section 3.01 shall be adjusted accordingly to provide to
Parent the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange,
dividend or increase.   ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
COMPANY   Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub,

delivered or made available to Parent a true, complete and correct copy of
(i) such Company Benefit Plan (of, if not written, a written summary of its
material terms) and the most recent summary plan description, if any, related
to such Company Benefit Plan, (ii) each trust agreement or other funding
arrangement, if any, relating to such Company Benefit Plan, (iii) the most
recent annual report (Form 5500), if any, filed with the IRS with respect to

Plan), (iv) the most recent actuarial report or financial statement, if any,

has any express or implied commitment, whether legally enforceable or not, to
modify, change or terminate any Company Benefit Plan, other than with respect
to a modification, change or termination required by ERISA or the Code.  
(b) Each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects
in accordance with its terms and all applicable laws, including ERISA and the
Code, and all contributions required to be made under the terms of any of the
Company Benefit Plans as of the date of this Agreement have been timely made
or, if not yet due, have been properly reflected on  
16             the most recent balance sheet filed or
incorporated by reference in the Company Reports prior to the date of this
Agreement. With respect to the Company Benefit Plans, no event has occurred
and, to the Knowledge of Company, there exists no condition or set of
circumstances in connection with which Company could be subject to any
material liability (other than for routine benefit liabilities) under the
terms of, or with respect to, such Company Benefit Plans, ERISA, the Code or
any other applicable Law.   (c) Company on behalf of itself and each Company
ERISA Affiliate (as defined below) hereby represents that: (i) each Company
Benefit Plan which is intended to qualify under Section 401(a), Section
401(k), Section 401(m) or Section 4975(e)(5) of the Code has received a
favorable determination, notification, advisory or opinion letter from the
IRS as to its qualified status, and each trust established in connection with
any Company which is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under
Section 501(a) of the Code has received a determination letter from the IRS
that it is so exempt, and to the Knowledge of Company no fact or event has
occurred that could adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company
Benefit Plan or the exempt status of any such trust; (ii) to the Knowledge of
Company there has been no prohibited transaction (within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and other than a transaction
that is exempt under a statutory or administrative exemption) with respect to
any Company Plan that could result in liability to the Company and (iii) each
Company Benefit Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued
after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms, without material
liability (other than (A) liability for ordinary administrative expenses
typically incurred in a termination event or (B) liability for the accrued
benefits as of the date of such termination to the extent that either there
are sufficient assets set aside in a trust or insurance contract to satisfy
such liability or such liability is reflected on the most recent consolidated
balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company Reports prior
to the date of this Agreement. No suit, administrative proceeding, action or
other litigation has been brought, or to the Knowledge of Company is
threatened, against or with respect to any such Company Benefit
Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the IRS or United States Department
of Labor (other than routine benefits claims).   (d) No Company Benefit
Plan is a multiemployer pension plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA)
or other pension plan subject to Title IV of Part 3 of Title I of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code and neither the Company nor any other trade or
business (whether or not incorporated) that is under "common control" with
Company (within the meaning of ERISA Section 4001) or with respect to which
Company could otherwise incur liability under Title IV of ERISA (a "COMPANY
ERISA AFFILIATE") has sponsored or contributed to or been required
to contribute to a multiemployer pension plan or other pension plan subject
to Title IV of ERISA. No material liability under Title IV of ERISA has
been incurred by Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate that has not been
satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a material risk to
Company of incurring or being subject (whether primarily, jointly or
secondarily) to a material liability thereunder. None of the assets of
Company is, or may reasonably be expected to become, the subject of any lien
arising under ERISA or Section 412(n) of the Code.   (e) Company has
delivered to Parent true, complete and correct copies of (i) all employment
agreements with officers and all consulting agreements of Company providing
for annual compensation in excess of $100,000, (ii) all severance plans,
agreements, programs and policies of Company with or relating to their
respective employees, directors or  
17             consultants, and (iii) all plans, programs,
agreements and other arrangements of Company with or relating to their
respective employees, directors or consultants which contain "change of
control" provisions. No payment or benefit which may be required to be made
by Company or which otherwise may be required to be made under the terms of
any Company Benefit Plan or other arrangement will constitute a parachute
payment under Code Section 280(G)(1), and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, alone or in
conjunction with any other possible event (including termination of
employment), (i) entitle any current or former employee or other service
provider of Company to severance benefits or any other payment, compensation
or benefit (including forgiveness of indebtedness), except as expressly
provided by this Agreement, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or increase the amount of compensation or benefit due any such
employee or service provider.   (f) Company is not a party to, and has no
obligations under or with respect to, any collective bargaining or other
labor union contract applicable to persons employed by Company and no
collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated by Company or any person
or entity that may obligate the Company thereunder. As of the date of this
Agreement, there is no labor dispute, strike or work stoppage against Company
pending or, to the Knowledge of Company, threatened which may interfere with
the respective business activities of Company. As of the date of this
Agreement, to the Knowledge of Company, none of Company or any of its
representatives or employees has committed any unfair labor practice in
connection with the operation of the respective businesses of Company, and
there is no charge or complaint against Company by the National Labor
Relations Board or any comparable Governmental Entity pending or threatened
in writing.   (g) Except as required by Law, no Company Benefit Plan
provides any of the following retiree or post-employment benefits to any
person: medical, disability or life insurance benefits. To the Knowledge of
Company, Company and the Company ERISA Affiliates are in compliance in all
material respects with (i) the requirements of the applicable health care
continuation and notice provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA") and the regulations
(including proposed regulations) thereunder and (ii) the applicable
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996, as amended, and the regulations (including the proposed regulations)
thereunder.   SECTION 4.10 Certain Tax Matters   Neither Company nor, to
the Knowledge of Company, any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take
any action (other than actions contemplated by this Agreement) that could be
expected to prevent the Merger from constituting a "reorganization" under
Section 368 of the Code. Company is not aware of any agreement or plan to
which Company or any of its Affiliates is a party or other circumstances
relating to Company or any of its Affiliates that could reasonably be
expected to prevent the Merger from so qualifying as a reorganization
under Section 368 of the Code.   18              SECTION 4.11

4.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "LISTED

in the aggregate;   (f) any contract limiting the freedom of Company to

risks as companies engaged in a similar business would, in accordance with
good business practice, customarily be insured. The policies of fire, theft,
liability and other insurance maintained with respect to the assets or

condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted.   SECTION 4.18 Affiliates

Applicable   The board of directors of Company has approved the Merger,
this Agreement and the Shareholders\' Agreement, and such approval is
sufficient to render inapplicable to the Merger, this Agreement and the
Shareholders\' Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Shareholders\' Agreement the provisions of Section 912 of New York
Law. To the Knowledge of Company, no other state takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation applies or purports to apply to the Merger, this
Agreement, the Shareholders\' Agreement or the transactions contemplated by

governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry

is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing (to the
extent applicable), in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to
be so qualified or licensed and in good standing that could not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.   SECTION 5.02 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws   The
copies of each of Parent\'s and Merger Subs\' certificate of incorporation
and bylaws previously provided to Company by Parent are true, complete and
correct copies thereof. Such certificates of incorporation and bylaws are in
full force and effect.   SECTION 5.03 Capitalization   (a) The authorized

transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to

and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Company, constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against
Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of
any applicable bankruptcy, moratorium, insolvency, reorganization or other
similar law affecting the enforceability of creditors\' rights generally and
to the effect of general principles of equity which may limit the

under, or give to others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on
any material property or asset of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary pursuant
to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license,
permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation.   (b) The execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub does not, and the
performance by Parent and Merger Sub of their obligations hereunder and the
consummation of the Merger will not, require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, or filing by Parent with or notification by
Parent to, any Governmental Entity, except pursuant to
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, Blue Sky
Laws, the rules and regulations of the NNM, state takeover laws, the

any such forms, reports, statements and documents Parent may file subsequent
to the date hereof until the Closing, the "PARENT REPORTS") and (B) with any
other Governmental Entities. Each Parent Report (i) was prepared in all
material respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act or the NNM, as the case may be, and (ii) did not at the time
it was filed (or, in the case of registration statements filed under the
Security Act, at the time of effectiveness) contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each material
form, report, statement and document referred to in clause (B) of this
paragraph was prepared in all material respects in accordance with the
requirements of applicable Law. No Parent Subsidiary is subject to
the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act or required to file
any form, report or other document with the SEC, the NNM, any other stock
exchange or any other comparable Governmental Entity.   (b) Except as is
provided in the Parent Reports, each of the consolidated financial statements

throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and each presented fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Parent and the consolidated Parent
Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and for the
respective periods indicated therein, except as otherwise noted therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring
immaterial year-end adjustments).   (c) Except as and to the extent set
forth or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries as reported in the Parent Reports, including the notes
thereto, none of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) that would be   29             required to be
reflected on a balance sheet or in notes thereto prepared in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, except for liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since December 31, 1999 that
have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 5.07 Certain Tax
Matters   Neither Parent nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any of its
Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action (other than actions
contemplated by this Agreement) that could reasonably be expected to prevent
the Merger from constituting a "reorganization" under Section 368 of the
Code. Parent is not aware of any agreement, plan or other circumstance that
could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from so qualifying as a
reorganization under Section 368 of the Code.   SECTION 5.08 Brokers   No
broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder\'s
or other fee or commission in connection with the Merger based
upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent.   ARTICLE VI

times upon prior notice to its and its subsidiaries\' officers, employees,

representation or warranty made in this Agreement.   (b) The parties hereto
shall comply with, and shall cause their respective Representatives to comply
with, all of their respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement

SECTION 6.04 No Solicitation of Transactions   (a) Until this Agreement has
been terminated as provided herein, Company shall not, directly or
indirectly, and shall cause its Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing nonpublic information), any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer (including, without limitation, any proposal or offer to
its shareholders) that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Competing Transaction, or enter into or maintain or continue discussions
or negotiate with any person in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain a
Competing Transaction, or agree to or endorse any Competing Transaction, or
authorize or permit any of Company\'s Representatives or subsidiaries, or any
Representative retained by Company\'s subsidiaries, to take any such action;
provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement, including this
Section 6.04, shall prohibit the Company or the board of directors of Company

Act with regard to a tender or exchange offer not made in violation of this
Section 6.04, (ii) referring any third party to this Section 6.04 or making a
copy of this Section 6.04 available to any third party solely in response to

shareholders of Company of this Agreement and the Merger, from
providing information (subject to a confidentiality agreement at least as
restrictive as the Confidentiality Agreement) in connection with, and
negotiating, another unsolicited, bona fide proposal regarding a Competing
Transaction that (i) Company\'s board of directors shall have concluded in
good faith, based upon the advice of independent outside counsel of
nationally recognized reputation (who may be the Company\'s regularly engaged
independent legal counsel), that such action is necessary to prevent
Company\'s board of directors from violating its fiduciary duties to the
Company or its shareholders under applicable law, (ii) with respect to which
Company\'s board of directors shall have determined, based upon the advice of
Company\'s independent financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation
(who may be the Company\'s regularly engaged independent financial advisors),
in the proper exercise of its fiduciary duties to the Company and its
shareholders that the acquiring party is reasonably capable of consummating
such Competing Transaction on the terms proposed, and (iii) Company\'s board
of directors reasonably believes in good faith, based on the advice of the
Company\'s independent financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation
(who may be the Company\'s regularly engaged independent financial advisors),
that such Competing Transaction is more favorable to the shareholders of the
Company from a financial point of view than the Merger, that such Competing
Transaction is more favorable to the shareholders of Company than the Merger
taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Competing Transaction
and the Merger (any such Competing Transaction being referred to herein as a
"SUPERIOR PROPOSAL"). Any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 6.04 by any Representative of Company, whether or not such Person is
purporting to act on behalf of Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be
a breach of this Section 6.04 by Company. Company shall notify Parent
promptly if any proposal or offer, or any inquiry or contact with any person
with respect thereto, regarding   33             a Competing
Transaction is made, such notice to include the identity of the person making
such proposal, offer, inquiry or contact, and the terms of such Competing
Transaction, and shall keep Parent apprised, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, of any modifications to the terms thereof. Prior to
accepting a Company Superior Proposal, Company shall provide Parent with 24
hours\' written notice of such intention. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained in this Section 6.04 shall prevent the Board of Directors
of Company from withdrawing or modifying its recommendation of this
Agreement, provided that the Company has complied with this Section 6.04,
following the receipt of a proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Competing Transaction if the Board of Directors of the
Company, after consultation with independent legal counsel (who may be the
Company\'s regularly engaged independent legal counsel) determines in good
faith that such action is necessary for the directors of Company to comply
with their fiduciary duties to the Company or its shareholders under
applicable law.   (b) Company immediately shall cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to a Competing Transaction. Company shall
not release any third party from, or waive any provision of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party.   SECTION
6.05 Tax-Free Transaction   (a) From and after the date of this Agreement,
each party hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to
qualify, and shall not take any actions or cause any actions to be taken
which could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code.   (b) Each of Company
and Parent shall execute and deliver to the other a certificate, in form
reasonably acceptable to Company and Parent, as the case may be, signed by an
officer of Company or Parent, as the case may be, setting forth factual
representations and covenants that will serve as a basis for the tax opinion
required under Section 8.02(c) hereof. Company shall use its reasonable
efforts to obtain a tax opinion that would satisfy the condition to the
Closing set forth in Section 8.02(c).   SECTION 6.06 Control of
Operations   Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Company prior
to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its operations.   SECTION 6.07
Further Action; Consents; Filings   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, each of the parties hereto shall use all reasonable
efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the Merger, (ii) obtain
from Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers,
approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained or made by Parent
or Company in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and (iii) make all
necessary   34             filings, and thereafter make any
other required or appropriate submissions, with respect to this Agreement and
the Merger required under (A) the rules and regulations of the NNM, (B) the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any other applicable Federal or state
securities Laws, (C) the HSR Act, if any, and (D) any other applicable Law.
The parties hereto shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection
with the making of all such filings, including by providing copies of all
such documents to the nonfiling parties and their advisors prior to filing,
and none of the parties shall file any such document if any of the other
parties shall have reasonably objected to the filing of such document. No
party shall consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or
waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the Merger at
the behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent and agreement of
the other parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.   (b) Each of Company and Parent will give any notices to third
persons, and use, and cause their respective subsidiaries to use, reasonable
efforts to obtain any consents from third persons necessary, proper or
advisable (as determined in good faith by Parent with respect to such notices
or consents to be delivered or obtained by Company) to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 6.08 Additional
Reports   Company and Parent shall each furnish to the other copies of
any reports of the type referred to in Sections 4.07 and 5.06, which it files
with the SEC on or after the date hereof, and Company and Parent, as the case
may be, covenant and warrant that as of the respective dates thereof, such
reports will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Any unaudited consolidated interim financial statements
included in such reports (including any related notes and schedules) will
fairly present in all material respects the financial position of Company and
its consolidated subsidiaries or Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries, as
the case may be, as of the dates thereof and the results of operations and
changes in financial position or other information including therein for the
periods or as of the date then ended (subject, where appropriate, to normal
year-end adjustments), in each case in accordance with past practice and U.S.
GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved (except as otherwise
disclosed in the notes thereto).   SECTION 6.09 Tax Information   Company
shall provide the following information to Parent not later than two weeks
after the date of this Agreement: (i) a complete list of the types of Tax
Returns being filed by Company in each taxing jurisdiction, (ii) a list of
all closed years with respect to each such type of Tax Return filed in each

transactions to which Company has been a party and (iv) a list of
the acquisition date, original cost, accumulated depreciation, adjusted tax

certificate of incorporation, by-laws or contractual arrangement in effect on
the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect

Effective Time were directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company,
unless such modification shall be required by Law, and Parent agrees to cause
the Surviving Corporation to comply with its obligations thereunder
and hereby guarantees the indemnification obligations referred to in this

will either guaranty the indemnification  
38             obligations referred to in this Section 7.04 or
will make or cause to be made proper provision so that the successors and

assume the indemnification obligations described herein for the benefit of
the Indemnified Parties and have substantially equal financial ability as the
Company (immediately prior to the Effective Time) to satisfy the obligations
of the parties pursuant to this Section 7.04 as a condition to such merger,
consolidation or transfer becoming effective.   (c) The provisions of this
Section 7.04 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be

policies maintained by Company; provided, however, that in no event shall
Parent be required to expend in any one year in excess of 150% of the annual

other, except to the extent required by applicable Law or the requirements of
the rules and regulations of the NNM, in which case the issuing party shall
use all reasonable efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any
such release or making any such public statement.   SECTION 7.07 NNM

Options to provide that no "cash-out" will be made in connection with the
Merger and obtaining the consent of affected optionees and warrant holders.
Parent shall reserve for issuance the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
that will be issuable upon exercise of Company Stock Options assumed pursuant
to Section 3.05 hereof. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time, Parent shall file with the SEC one or more registration
statements on Form S-8 for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with
respect to Company Stock Options and will maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statements for so long as any of such options or other rights

For all purposes (including, without limitation, eligibility, vesting, and
benefit accrual) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to former Company employees after the
Effective Time, each such employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with Company before the Effective Time, to the same extent as
such employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Benefit Plan, except for purposes of
benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans, if any. Following the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries       
40              to, waive any pre-existing condition limitation
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in which such employees and their eligible dependents
participate (except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitation
would have been applicable under the comparable Company welfare benefit plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time).   (b) Unless Parent consents
otherwise in writing, Company shall take all action necessary to terminate,
or cause to terminate, before the Effective Time, any Company Benefit Plan
that is a 401(k) plan or other defined contribution retirement plan. Parent
and Company shall take all action necessary to permit Company employees to
elect direct rollovers of their account balances in Company\'s terminated
401(k) plan or other defined contribution plan (including outstanding
participant loans, if any) to a qualified relevant plan of Parent or its
Subsidiaries.   ARTICLE VIII   CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER   SECTION 8.01

extension thereof) applicable  to the consummation of the Merger under the
HSR Act or any other  applicable competition, merger control or similar Law
shall have  expired or been terminated; and   (e) all consents, approvals
and authorizations legally  required to be obtained to consummate the Merger

addressed to Company, and reasonably satisfactory to  it, based upon
customary representations of Company and Parent and  customary assumptions,
to the effect that the Merger will constitute a  "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code,  which opinion shall not have been
withdrawn or modified in any  material respect; provided, however, that if
such firm does not render  such opinion, this condition shall nonetheless be

Competing Transaction with respect to Company and (B) within 12 months after
such termination, Company shall enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to any Competing Transaction or any Competing Transaction involving

SHAREHOLDERS\' AGREEMENT   This COMPANY SHAREHOLDERS\' AGREEMENT (this
"Agreement") is made and entered into as of October 2, 2000 by and among
DoubleClick Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and the undersigned
shareholders (each, a "Shareholder" and collectively, the "Shareholders") of
NetCreations, Inc., a New York corporation ("Company"). Capitalized terms
used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings set
forth in the Merger Agreement described below.   RECITALS   WHEREAS,
pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of
the date hereof, among Parent, Genesis Merger Sub, Inc., a New York
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and
Company (such agreement as it may be amended is hereinafter referred to as
the "Merger Agreement"), Parent has agreed to acquire the
outstanding securities of Company pursuant to a statutory merger of Merger
Sub with and into Company (the "Merger") in which each outstanding share of
capital stock of Company (the "Company Capital Stock") will be converted into
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Parent (the "Parent
Shares") at the Exchange Ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement (the
"Transaction");   WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent to enter into the
Merger Agreement and consummate the Transaction, Company has agreed to use
its reasonable best efforts to cause certain shareholders of Company to
execute and deliver to Parent a Company Shareholders\' Agreement upon the
terms set forth herein; and   WHEREAS, each Shareholder is the registered
and beneficial owner of such number of shares of the outstanding capital
stock of Company as is indicated on the signature page of this Agreement
under the heading "Total Number of Shares of Company Capital Stock owned on
the date hereof", and such Shareholder desires to make the number of shares
indicated on the signature page of this Agreement under the heading "Total
Number of Shares of Company Capital Stock subject to this Agreement" (the
"Shares") subject to the terms of this Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, the
parties agree as follows:   1. Ownership of Shares; Transfer. (a)Each
Shareholder represents and warrants to Parent that such Shareholder is the
beneficial owner of (i.e., has sole or shared voting or investment power with
respect to) the Shares. The Shares constitute a portion of such
Shareholder\'s interest in the outstanding capital stock and voting
securities of Company. The Shares are free and clear of any liens, claims,
options, charges or other encumbrances. Such Shareholder\'s principal
residence or place of business is accurately set forth on the signature page
hereto. As used herein, the term "Expiration Date" shall mean the earlier to
occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) termination of the Merger Agreement
in accordance with the terms thereof.    A-1              
(b) Shareholder agrees not to transfer (except as may be specifically
required by court order or by operation of law, in which case any such
transferee shall agree to be bound hereby), sell, exchange, pledge
or otherwise dispose of or encumber any Shares, or to make any offer or
agreement relating thereto, at any time prior to the Expiration Date.   2.
Agreement to Vote Shares. Prior to the Expiration Date, at every meeting of
the shareholders of Company at which any of the following is considered or
voted upon, and at every adjournment thereof, and on every action or approval
by written resolution of the shareholders of Company with respect to any of
the following, each Shareholder shall vote, or, using such
Shareholder\'s best efforts, and to the full extent legally permitted, cause
the holder of record to vote the Shares as to which such Shareholder then has
voting control, in favor of approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and
of the Transaction.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit or restrict any Shareholder from (i) acting in his or
her capacity as a director or officer of Company, to the extent applicable,
it being understood that this Agreement shall apply to each Shareholder
solely in his or her capacity as a shareholder of Company or (ii) voting in
his or her sole discretion on any matter other than those matters referred to
in the first paragraph of this Section 2.   3. Irrevocable Proxy. Each
Shareholder hereby agrees to timely deliver to Parent a duly executed proxy
in the form attached hereto as Annex A (the "Proxy"), such Proxy to cover the
Shares in respect of which such Shareholder is entitled to vote at each
meeting of the shareholders of Company and held by such Shareholder as of the
record date for such meeting (including, without limitation, each written
consent in lieu of a meeting). In the event that any Shareholder is unable to
provide any such Proxy in a timely manner, such Shareholder hereby grants
Parent a power of attorney to execute and deliver such Proxy for and on
behalf of such Shareholder, such power of attorney, which being coupled with
an interest, shall survive any death, disability, bankruptcy or any other
such impediment of such Shareholder. Upon the execution of this Agreement by
each Shareholder, such Shareholder hereby revokes any and all prior proxies
or powers of attorney given by such Shareholder with respect to the Shares
and agrees not to grant any subsequent proxies or powers of attorney
with respect to the Shares until after the Expiration Date.   4.
Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Shareholder. Each Shareholder
hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Parent as follows:   (a) Each
Shareholder has full power, authority and legal capacity to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by such Shareholder and constitutes the
valid and binding obligation of such Shareholder, enforceable against such
Shareholder in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by (i) the
effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, conservatorship, arrangement, moratorium or
other laws affecting or relating to the rights of creditors generally, or
(ii) the rules governing the availability of specific performance, injunctive
relief or other equitable remedies and general principles of
equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Shareholder does not,
and the performance of such Shareholder\'s obligations hereunder will not,
result in any breach of or constitute a default    
A-2              (or an event that with notice or lapse of time
or both would become a default) under, or give to others any right to
terminate, amend, accelerate or cancel any right or obligation under, or
result in the creation of any lien or encumbrance on any Shares pursuant to,
any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license,
permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which such Shareholder
is a party or by which such Shareholder or the Shares are or will be bound or
affected.   (b) Except to the extent otherwise permitted under Section 6.04
of the Merger Agreement, until the Expiration Date, each Shareholder, in the
Shareholder\'s capacity as a Shareholder, will not (and will use
such Shareholder\'s reasonable best efforts to cause its affiliates,
officers, directors and employees and any investment banker, attorney,
accountant or other agent retained by such Shareholder, not to): (i) initiate
or solicit, directly or indirectly, any proposal, plan or offer to acquire
all or any material part of the business or properties or capital stock of

to liquidate Company or otherwise distribute to the shareholders of Company
all or any substantial part of the business, properties or capital stock of
Company (each, an "Acquisition Proposal"); (ii) initiate, directly or
indirectly, any contact with any person in an effort to or with a view

associate, agent or representative of Parent) under any circumstances that

Proposal; or (iv) negotiate or enter into discussions or an agreement,
directly or indirectly, with any entity or group with respect of any
potential Acquisition Proposal. In the event any Shareholder, in
such Shareholder\'s capacity as a Shareholder, shall receive or become aware
of any Acquisition Proposal subsequent to the date hereof, such Shareholder
shall promptly inform Parent as to any such matter and the details thereof to
the extent possible without breaching any other agreement to which such
Shareholder is a party or violating its fiduciary duties.   (c) Each
Shareholder understands and agrees that if any Shareholder attempts to vote
or provide any other person with the authority to vote any of the Shares held
by such Shareholder as of the record date for any meeting at which such
Shares are to be voted other than in compliance with this Agreement, Company
shall not, and such Shareholder hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
instructs Company to not record such vote unless and until such Shareholder
shall have complied with the terms of this Agreement.   5. No Limitation on
Discretion as Director. If any Shareholder is a natural person and is a
member of the board of directors of Company, then this Agreement will apply
to the exercise by such Shareholder in his or her individual capacity of
rights attaching to ownership of the Shares, and nothing herein shall be
deemed to apply to, or to limit in any manner the discretion of such
Shareholder with respect to, any action which may be taken or omitted by him
or her acting in his or her fiduciary capacity as a director of Company.  
6. Additional Documents. Each Shareholder hereby covenants and agrees to
execute and deliver any additional documents necessary or desirable, in the
reasonable opinion of Parent, to carry out the purpose and intent of
this Agreement.   A-3               7. Consent and Waiver.
Each Shareholder hereby gives any consents or waivers that are reasonably
required for the consummation of the Transaction under the terms of any
agreement to which such Shareholder is a party; provided, however, that such
Shareholder shall not be required by this Section 7 to give any consent or
deliver in his or her capacity as a director or officer of Company.   8.

confidence, and (ii) not to divulge any such information to any third person,
except to the extent any of the same is hereafter publicly disclosed by
Parent.   10. Miscellaneous.   10.1 Severability. If any term, provision,
covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, then the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated.   10.2 Binding Effect and Assignment. This Agreement and all

Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief. The parties hereto acknowledge that

a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and NetCreations, Inc., a
New York corporation ("Company"), Parent has agreed to acquire Company
through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Company (the "Transaction").
Capitalized terms used without definition herein shall have the meanings set
forth in the Merger Agreement.   The undersigned has been advised that as of
the date hereof the undersigned may be deemed to be (but does not hereby
admit to be) an "affiliate" of Company, as the term "affiliate" is (i)
defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and
regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), and/or (ii) used in and for purposes of
Accounting Series Releases 130, 135 and 146 and Staff Accounting Bulletin
Two, as amended, of the SEC.   The undersigned understands that the
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein will be relied
upon by Parent, other stockholders of Parent, Merger Sub, Company and their
respective counsel and accounting firms. Except to the extent written
notification to the contrary is received by Parent from the undersigned prior
to the consummation of the Transaction, the representations and warranties
contained herein shall be accurate at all times from the date hereof through
the Effective Time.   The undersigned represents and warrants to, and agrees
with, Parent that:   1. The undersigned has full power, authority and
legal capacity to execute and deliver this Company Affiliate Agreement and to
make the representations and warranties set forth herein and to perform the
undersigned\'s obligations hereunder;   2. The undersigned has carefully
read this Company Affiliate Agreement and the Merger Agreement and discussed
their requirements and other applicable limitations upon the undersigned\'s
ability to sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber
Parent\'s common stock, par value $.001 per share ("Parent Common Stock"), to
the extent the undersigned felt necessary, with the undersigned\'s counsel or
counsel for Company;   C-1               3. The undersigned is
the beneficial owner of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (the

contemplation of the Transaction.   4. The undersigned will not make any
sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition of or encumbrance
upon Parent Common Stock (i) in violation of the Securities Act or the Rules
and Regulations or (ii) to a transferee that has not agreed in writing to be
bound hereby;   5. The undersigned has been advised that the issuance
of Parent Common Stock to the undersigned in connection with the Transaction
has been or will be registered with the SEC under the Securities Act on
a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, the undersigned has also
been advised that, because at the time the Transaction was or will be
submitted for a vote of the shareholders of Company the undersigned may be
deemed to be or have been an affiliate of Company and the distribution by the
undersigned of any Parent Common Stock has not been registered under the
Securities Act, the undersigned may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge or
otherwise dispose of or encumber Parent Common Stock issued to the
undersigned in the Transaction unless (i) such sale, assignment, transfer,
pledge or other disposition or encumbrance has been registered under the
Securities Act, (ii) such sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or other
disposition or encumbrance is made in conformity with the volume and other
limitations of Rule 145 or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably
acceptable to Parent, such sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or other
disposition or encumbrance is otherwise exempt from registration under
the Securities Act;   6. The undersigned understands that, except as
provided in the Merger Agreement, Parent is under no obligation to register
the sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition or encumbrance of
Parent Common Stock by the undersigned or on the undersigned\'s behalf under
the Securities Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make
compliance with an exemption from such registration available;   7. The
undersigned also understands that Parent may impose stop transfer
instructions or elect to not permit the transfer of shares of Parent Common
Stock or the issuance of a new certificate representing such shares, and that
there will be placed on the certificates for Parent Common Stock issued to
the undersigned, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in
substance:   "THE SECURITIES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE  ISSUED IN
A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER  THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933, AS AMENDED, APPLIES. THE  SECURITIES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY
ONLY BE  TRANSFERRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT DATED 
OCTOBER 2, 2000 BETWEEN THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND  DOUBLECLICK INC., A
COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE  PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF DOUBLECLICK
INC."   C-2               8. The undersigned also understands
that, unless the sale, transfer, or other disposition by the undersigned of
Parent Common Stock issued to the undersigned has been registered under the
Securities Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule
145, Parent reserves the right to put the following legend on the
certificates issued to any transferee of the undersigned:   "THE SECURITIES
EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE  ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO RECEIVED SUCH
SHARES IN A  TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES 
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, APPLIES, AND WERE NOT ACQUIRED BY THE  HOLDER WITH A
VIEW TO TRANSFER, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION  WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF
WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE  SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED. THE SECURITIES
EVIDENCED  BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE 
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR ANY STATE SECURITIES  LAWS, AND MAY
NOT BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF, UNLESS  SUCH SALE, TRANSFER, OR OTHER
DISPOSAL IS MADE IN CONNECTION  WITH AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT
UNDER THE SECURITIES  ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE
SECURITIES  LAWS OR IS EXEMPT FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH 
ACT, THE RULES AND REGULATIONS IN EFFECT THEREUNDER AND ANY  APPLICABLE STATE
SECURITIES LAWS."   9. The legends set forth in paragraphs 7 and 8 above
shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend
if the undersigned shall have delivered to Parent a copy of a letter from the
staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that such legend is not required for
purposes of the Securities Act.   10. This Company Affiliate Agreement
shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of New York without giving effect to the
principles of conflicts of laws thereof and may be executed in
counterparts.   (Signature Page Follows)    C-3
