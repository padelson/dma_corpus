of the Cash on Hand, Indebtedness Payoff Amount, Net Intercompany Payables
Amount, OCP Net Working Capital Amount and the DES Net Working Capital Amount,
which except as set forth on _Schedule 1.6_ shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied consistently with the Business Accounting Practices and
Procedures ( _provided_ that in the event of a conflict between GAAP and the

Auditor material relating to the determination and to discuss the
determination with the Independent Auditor. The Independent Auditor shall act

and adjust and establish any disputed adjustment of the Purchase Price amount
to reflect such resolution. It is the intent of Buyer and Sellers that the
process set forth in this _Section 1.6_ and the activities of the Independent
Auditor in connection herewith are not intended to be and, in fact, are not
arbitration and that no formal arbitration rules shall be followed (including
rules with respect to procedures and discovery). Parent and Buyer shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Auditor to
resolve all such disagreements as soon as practicable. The resolution of the
dispute by the Independent Auditor shall be final, binding and non-appealable
on the parties hereto. The Closing Statement shall be modified if necessary to
reflect such determination. The fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor
shall be allocated to be paid by Buyer, on the one hand, and/or Parent, on the
other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested
amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by
such party, as determined by the Independent Auditor.

deficiency or adjustment by any Tax authority challenging such Final

Agreement was entered into, if payment had been required in full at the time

Law. At least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer Parent shall
notify Parent if Buyer Parent intends to deduct and withhold any amounts
pursuant to this _Section 1.9_ and shall reasonably cooperate with Parent to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any such withholding. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Buyer Parent,

 



      
 

 



 

such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to Sellers in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

Buyer Parent hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

 



 

4.1 _Organization of Buyer_. Buyer Parent is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Canada with all
requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which it is a
party. Each Buyer is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
(where applicable) under the Laws of the state, province or other jurisdiction
of its formation, with all requisite corporate power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and each Ancillary
Agreement to which it is a party.

 



 

4.2 _Authority; No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

 



 

(a) Buyer Parent and each Buyer have all requisite power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement. This Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which Buyer Parent and each Buyer are a party have been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by Buyer Parent and such Buyer, and
(assuming this Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of each of the
other parties thereto) constitute the legal, valid, and binding obligations of
Buyer Parent and such Buyer, enforceable against Buyer Parent and such Buyer
in accordance with their respective terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy Laws, other similar Laws affecting creditors rights and
general principles of equity affecting the availability of specific
performance and other equitable remedies.

 



 

(b) Except for (i) the Antitrust Approvals, (ii) any notices, reports,
registrations, other filings or Consents contemplated by _Schedule 4.2(b)_ ,
and (iii) where the failure of any of the following to be true would not have
a materially adverse impact on Buyer Parents or Buyers ability to consummate
the Transactions, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Buyer Parent or Buyer nor the consummation or performance of any of the

 



      
 

 



 

Transactions by Buyer Parent or Buyer will give any Person the right to
prevent, delay or otherwise interfere with any of the Transactions pursuant to
(i) any provision of Buyer Parents or Buyers Organizational Documents, (ii)
any law, statute or regulation or Order, judgment or decree to which Buyer
Parent or Buyer may be subject except as would not have a materially adverse
impact on Buyer Parents and Buyers ability to consummate the Transactions or
(iii) any Contract to which Buyer Parent or Buyer is a party or by which Buyer
Parent or Buyer may be bound except as would not have a materially adverse
impact on Buyer Parents or Buyers ability to consummate the Transactions.
Except for the Antitrust Approvals, Buyer is not and will not be required to
obtain any Consent from any Person in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation or performance of any of the
Transactions that would not have a materially adverse impact on Buyer Parents
or Buyers ability to consummate the Transactions.

 



 

4.3 _Proceedings_. There is no pending Legal Proceeding that has been
commenced against Buyer Parent or Buyer and that challenges, or may have the
effect of preventing, delaying, making illegal, or otherwise interfering with,
any of the Transactions. To Buyer Parents knowledge, no such Legal Proceeding
has been threatened.

 



 

4.4 _Brokers or Finders_. There are no claims for brokerage commissions,
finders fees or similar compensation in connection with the Transactions
based on any arrangement or agreement made by or on behalf of Buyer Parent or
Buyer.

 



 

4.5 _Financing_. On the Closing Date, Buyer will have sufficient cash,
available lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds to
pay the Purchase Price and any other amounts to be paid by it hereunder. Buyer
has delivered to Parent a true and complete copy of the executed Commitment
Letter (together with any amendments or modifications thereto). Neither Buyer
nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter or other
arrangement relating to the financing of the Transactions, other than as set
forth in the Commitment Letter. The respective commitments contained in the
Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. The
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and represents a valid, binding
and enforceable obligation of Buyer and each other party thereto, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, is a valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of the lenders which are a party thereto, to provide the financing
contemplated thereby subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the
Financing Conditions and, subject to the qualification that such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
other laws of general application relating to or affecting rights of
creditors. Buyer has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment
fees and other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the date of
this Agreement in connection with the Financing. No event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or
default on the part of Buyer or any other party thereto under the Commitment
Letter. Buyer has no reason to believe that (i) it or any other party thereto
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term of the Commitment Letter,
(ii) any of the Financing Conditions will not be satisfied or (iii) the
Financing will not be available to Buyer on the Closing Date. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing, other than the Financing Conditions.

 



      
 

 



 

4.6 _Investment Representation_. Buyer is purchasing the Purchased Stock for
its own account with the present intention of holding such securities for
investment purposes and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any
public distribution of such securities in violation of any federal or state
securities Laws. Buyer is an "accredited investor" as defined in Regulation D
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "). Buyer acknowledges that it is
informed as to the risks of the Transactions and of ownership of the Purchased
Stock. Buyer acknowledges that the Purchased Stock has not been registered
under the Securities Act or any state or foreign securities Laws and that the
Purchased Stock may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged,
hypothecated or otherwise disposed of unless such transfer, sale, assignment,
pledge, hypothecation or other disposition is pursuant to the terms of an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act and registered under
any applicable state or foreign securities Laws or pursuant to an exemption
from registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state or foreign
securities Laws.

 



 

4.7 _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to the Transactions, Buyer
Parent and each of its Subsidiaries (including Buyer and the Purchased
Entities) shall be able to pay their respective debts as they become due and
shall own property which has a fair saleable value greater than the amounts
required to pay their respective debts (including a reasonable estimate of the
amount of all contingent liabilities). Immediately after giving effect to the
Transactions, Buyer Parent and each of its Subsidiaries (including Buyer and
the Purchased Entities) shall have adequate capital to carry on their
respective businesses. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation
is being incurred in connection with the Transactions with the intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Buyer Parent
and each of its Subsidiaries (including Buyer and the Purchased Entities).

 



 

4.8 _Due Diligence Investigation_. Buyer has had an opportunity to discuss the
business, management, operations and finances of each of the Businesses with
each of the Sellers and the Purchased Entities and their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, Representatives and Affiliates, and has had an
opportunity to inspect the facilities of each of the Businesses. Buyer has
conducted its own independent investigation of each of the Businesses and has
been furnished by the Sellers or the Purchased Entities, or their
Representatives, with all information, documents and other materials relating
to each of the Businesses that Buyer believes is necessary to enter into this
Agreement. In making its decision to execute and deliver this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements and to consummate the Transactions, Buyer has relied
solely upon the representations and warranties of Parent set forth in _Article
3_ and has not relied upon any other information provided by, for or on behalf
of the Sellers or the Purchased Entities or any of their respective agents or
Representatives, to Buyer in connection with the Transactions.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 5. _ 
PRE-CLOSING COVENANTS_**

 



 

Parent and Buyer covenant and agree with each other as follows:

 



 

5.1 _Access and Investigation_. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing, upon reasonable notice from Buyer, each Seller shall and shall cause
each Purchased Entity to,

 



      
 

 



 

(a) provide Buyer and its Representatives with reasonable access to the
offices, properties, appropriate officers, employees, Books and Records of
each of the Businesses and (b) furnish Buyer and its Representatives with such
additional financial, operating and other data and information of the
Businesses, the Purchased Entities, the Purchased Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities as may reasonably be requested, including to facilitate Buyers
review of compliance by the Sellers (with respect to the Businesses) and the
Purchased Entities with the Laws referenced in _Sections 3.8_ , _3.9_ , _3.10_
, _3.13_ , _3.14_ and _3.15_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Seller or
Purchased Entity may refuse Buyer and its Representatives access to the extent
that such access would, in the reasonable determination of any Seller,
unreasonably interfere with or result in unreasonable access to any business
of any Seller or any portion of the offices or properties of any Seller that
is not part of the Businesses. Within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of the
final Phase I for the Schererville, Indiana (650 and 705 West 67th Place)
property and the Cleveland, Ohio (15939 Industrial Parkway) property last to
be received, Buyer Parent will deliver to Parent a scope of work (" _Scope of
Work_ ") which Scope of Work shall, in Buyer Parents judgment, have a
reasonable basis in light of the final Phase I and observed condition of the
properties. Buyer Parent may use any environmental consultant of its choosing,
including ERM, in preparing and performing the Scope of Work. Within five (5)
days of receipt of the proposed Scope of Work, Parent will provide Buyer
Parent with any comments that it has on the applicable Scope of Work, if any,
and the parties will work together in good faith to agree upon a final Scope
of Work. Buyer agrees and acknowledges that the results of any such
environmental assessment are not grounds for termination of this Agreement or
the failure of any condition hereunder to the Closing. For the avoidance of
doubt, Buyer, should it desire to do so, will be able to hire external
advisors to perform and assist Buyer in intangible, entity, property, and
pension valuations between the date hereof and the Closing Date. Sellers will
provide Buyer and Buyers external advisors with reasonable access to the
appropriate people, financials, and facilities of the Sellers for a limited
number of individuals representing Buyer to complete the valuations noted
previously, review and value the fixed assets between the date hereof and the
Closing Date, and prepare mapping from Sellers accounts/departments to
Buyers accounts/departments. Further, the parties hereto shall provide to one
another all cooperation reasonably necessary to prepare such financial
information regarding the Businesses as required under any applicable
securities Laws to which Buyer Parent is subject; provided, that Buyer Parent
shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable upon request from Parent,
reimburse the Sellers for all out-of-pocket costs (including fees and expenses
of accountants and legal counsel) incurred by the Sellers or their
Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. For the avoidance of doubt,
the immediately preceding sentence shall not require cooperation by the
Sellers or their Subsidiaries or Representatives to the extent that it would
unreasonably interfere with the Businesses or the other businesses or
operations of the Sellers or their Subsidiaries. Buyer acknowledges that it
and its representatives and advisors remain bound by the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated as of February 25, 2011, with Parent (as supplemented, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



 

5.2 _Conduct of Businesses_. Prior to the Closing, except as requested or
consented to by Buyer in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), as specifically contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, or as set forth on _Schedule 5.2_ ,
each Seller shall and shall cause the Purchased Entities to conduct the
Businesses in the ordinary course in all material respects. Except as
specifically contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, or as
set forth on _Schedule 5.2_, each Seller shall not

 



      
 

 



 

and shall cause each Purchased Entity not to, do any of the following with
respect to either Business without the prior written consent of Buyer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed:

material Purchased Assets or material assets of the Purchased Entities, taken
as a whole, other than Permitted Encumbrances;

 



 

(b) issue, sell or redeem any shares of capital stock, securities convertible
into capital stock or warrants, options or other rights to acquire capital

or like change in its capitalization or pay any dividend with respect to the
capital stock of any Purchased Entity;

 



 

(d) amend or modify the Organizational Documents of the Purchased Entities;

 



 

(e) become legally committed to any new capital expenditures requiring

projections provided to Buyer;

 



 

(f) sell, assign or transfer any tangible assets included in the Purchased
Assets that in the aggregate are material to the Businesses, taken as a whole,

material to the Businesses, taken as a whole, except, in each case, in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices;

 



 

(g) sell, assign, exclusively license or transfer any material Intellectual
Property Assets, except in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practices;

 



 

(h) except (i) in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) as may be required
by applicable Law, Order or Contract, amend, modify or terminate any Employee
Plan (other than in connection with the modification by any Seller or its
Affiliates of any Employee Plan or related trust, in a manner affecting
employees generally, including Business Employees, and as would not result in
any material increase in the aggregate in the Liability of Buyer and its
Affiliates);

 



 

(i) except (i) in the ordinary course of business, (ii) as may be required
pursuant to any of the plans, policies, agreements or arrangements of the
Sellers or the Purchased Entities, or (iii) as may be required by applicable

materially alter the terms and conditions of employment of, any Business
Employee or any other person in a manner that causes such person to become a
Business Employee (other than in connection with a Business Employees
promotion to a vacant position in either of the Businesses at the same rate of
compensation applicable to the employee formerly holding such position and as
would not result in any material increase in the aggregate in the Liability of
Buyer and its Affiliates);

 



       
 

 



 

(j) change any accounting policies, practices or procedures of either of the
Businesses, except as required by GAAP or applicable Law;

 



 

(k) make, revoke or amend any material Tax election, change any method of Tax
accounting or settle or compromise any Tax Contest (i) with respect to any
Purchased Entity and, (ii) if any such action shall be binding on Buyer or its

(p) enter into any contract or other agreement to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the Sellers or the Purchased Entities shall be prohibited
from (i) transferring any Cash held by such entities, whether or not used in
the Businesses and whether by distribution, dividend, repayment of
Indebtedness or otherwise, to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing or (ii) settling any intercompany accounts payable, accounts
receivable or Indebtedness prior to the Closing.

 



 

5.3 _Required Governmental Consents, Approvals and Filings_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the
parties hereto shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause
to be taken, such action and do, or cause to be done, such things necessary,
proper or advisable under any applicable Law, Order or otherwise, to
consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly as practicable,
including the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_, and

the conditions of Buyer set forth in _Section 6.2_, (ii) obtain from any
Governmental Entities any Consents required to be obtained by any party or any

of the Transactions, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date of this Agreement, make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any

 



      
 

 



 

other required submissions, and pay any fees due in connection therewith, with
respect to this Agreement required under the HSR Act or any other applicable
Antitrust Law and in any event will make all necessary filings under the HSR
Act within a reasonable period after the date of this Agreement but in no
event later than February 28, 2013. The parties hereto shall cooperate fully
with each other in connection with (y) assessing whether any action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required, in connection
with the consummation of the Transactions and (z) seeking any such Consents or
making any such filings. The parties hereto shall furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing under the rules and
regulations of any applicable Law in connection with the Transactions.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.3_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice prior
to the making or commencement of any request or Legal Proceeding by or before
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions; (ii) keep the other
parties informed as to the status of any such request or Legal Proceeding;
(iii) promptly inform the other parties of any **** communication to or from
the United States Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division
of the United States Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ ") or any other

reasonable information requests of the FTC, DOJ or other Governmental Entity.
Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties and will
consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with any
filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument,
opinion, or proposal made or submitted in connection with the Transactions. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any
applicable Law or Order, in connection with any such request or Legal
Proceeding, to the extent reasonably practicable, each party hereto will
permit authorized Representatives of the other parties to be present at each
substantive meeting or conference relating to such request or Legal Proceeding
and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any substantive
document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in
connection with such request or Legal Proceeding.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer agrees
to take all actions necessary to permit and cause the Closing to occur prior
to the Outside Date, notwithstanding any requirement, request or condition
sought or imposed by the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity ****
acting under any Antitrust Law, in each case, relating in any way to this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions (" _Government Conditions_
"), where the failure to satisfy any Government Condition would delay, prevent
or make illegal such timely consummation of the Transactions, including (i)
complying with any request, directions, determinations, requirements or
conditions of the FTC, DOJ or other Governmental Entity acting under any
Antitrust Law, (ii) complying with requests or undertakings to license, divest
or hold separate any of its or any of its Subsidiaries existing assets or
businesses, (iii) complying with other limitations or other requirements of
the FTC, DOJ or other Governmental Entity **** acting under any Antitrust Law
with respect to the operation of the Businesses following the Closing Date,
and (iv) taking all other actions necessary or reasonable, including
instigating or defending any proceeding or litigation through appeal, making
reasonable offers of compromise, and promptly removing or causing to be
removed any direction, determination, requirement, injunction, Order,
condition or limitation, that prevents or would prevent, or that makes
illegal, the timely consummation of the Transactions, in each case, without
adjustment to the consideration to be paid to the Sellers. For purposes of
this provision, Government Conditions

 



      
 

 



 

shall include any such condition as it relates to, impacts or affects the
United States located assets or United States revenues of Buyer or the
Sellers. No such Government Condition shall exceed $5,000,000 in total value
(as measured by book value of assets or total revenue in the most recently
completed fiscal year), in the aggregate. The Sellers shall direct and fund
the defense of any United States District Court litigation and through any and
all appeals thereof required in connection with this provision. For the
avoidance of doubt, it is the intention of the foregoing provisions that the
Sellers and Buyer be assured that this Agreement and the Transactions may be
consummated, notwithstanding any investigation, challenge or requirement of a
remedy by the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity **** acting under
any Antitrust Law.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Buyer, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the operations of either of the Businesses prior to
the Closing. Prior to the Closing, Sellers and the Purchased Entities shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over the operations of each of the Businesses.

 



 

5.4 _Third Party Consents and Real Property Estoppels_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto shall give, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give, any notices to third parties, and use, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to obtain
any third party Consents (including with respect to any Contracts) required
under any Material Contract or otherwise required to be disclosed on _Schedule
3.2(b)_ or pursuant to _Section 4.2(b)_; _provided_ , that no Seller shall
be required to make any payments, commence litigation or suffer any material
burden in connection with obtaining any such third party Consents; _provided_
, _further_ , that no Seller shall be required to obtain any third party
Consent for any Contract to the extent that the services or products provided
by such Contract are being provided by Sellers pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
prior to Closing and provide to Buyer, estoppel certificates in form
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer confirming the form and status of each Real
Property Lease and Real Property Sublease from the counterparties to the same;
provided that no Seller shall be required to make any payments or commence
litigation in connection with obtaining such estoppels.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Contract, lease or Permit
related to either of the Businesses or any claim or right or any benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted assignment thereof,
without the consent of a third-party thereto, would constitute a default
thereof or in any way adversely affect the rights of any Seller or Buyer
thereunder. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.4(c)_ , if such consent is not
obtained, or if an attempted assignment thereof would be ineffective or would
affect the rights thereunder so that Buyer would not receive all such rights,
each applicable Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to enter into a
mutually acceptable arrangement with Buyer, solely to the extent such an
arrangement can replicate the rights under such Contract, lease or Permit, to
provide to Buyer the benefits under any such Contract, lease, Permit or any
claim or right, including enforcement for the benefit of Buyer of any and all
rights of such Seller or its Subsidiaries against a third-party

 



      
 

 



 

thereto arising out of the default or cancellation by such third-party or
otherwise, and Buyer shall assume all the burdens and obligations thereunder.

 



 

5.5 _Current Evidence of Title to Real Property_. At the request of Buyer, and
at Buyers sole cost and expense, Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with and assist Buyer in seeking for each parcel, tract
or subdivided land lot of real property included in the Asset Sale Real
Property, and at its option, the customary local equivalent for the balance of
the Owned Real Property:

 



 

(a) _Title Commitment_. From a title company selected by Buyer (" _Title
Insurer_ "), title commitments issued by the Title Insurer to insure title to
such real property and insurable appurtenances, if any, in the amount of that
portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such real property, covering such
real property, naming Buyer or its designee as the proposed insured and having
an effective date after the date of this Agreement, wherein Title Insurer will
agree to issue an owners policy of title insurance in the most recent ALTA
form, without the standard printed exceptions (each a " _Title Commitment_ ")
and complete legible copies of all recorded documents listed therein (the ****

responsible for the cost of any endorsements to the title policy desired by
Buyer.

and areas affected by any Recorded Documents affecting such real property as
disclosed in the Title Commitment (identified by recording or filing
information) as well as any encroachments onto the real property or by any
part of the real property onto any easement area or adjoining property (each,
a " _Survey_ "). Buyer will be responsible for the cost of the Surveys.

 



 

5.6 _Financing_. Buyer shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary to arrange the Financing as promptly

Buyers control or which may be satisfied by Buyer; (iii) negotiating,
executing and delivering Financing Documents that reflect the terms contained

and (iv) drawing such amount of the Financing as is necessary to enable Buyer
to pay the cash portion of the Purchase Price contemplated by _Section 1.5_,

Financing Conditions have been satisfied or, upon funding would be satisfied.
Buyer shall give Parent prompt notice of any breach or repudiation by any
party to the Commitment Letter of which Buyer or its Affiliates become aware.
Without limiting Buyers other obligations under this _Section 5.6_, if a
Financing Failure Event occurs, Buyer shall (x) immediately notify Parent of
such Financing Failure Event and the reasons therefor, (y) in consultation
with Parent, obtain alternative financing from alternative financing sources,
in an amount sufficient to pay the Purchase Price and any other amounts to be
paid by it hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this

and (z) obtain, and when obtained, provide Parent with a copy of, a new

expected to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions,
including the Financing.

Closing or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article 10_, each
party hereto will give prompt written notice to the other parties of any
inaccuracy or breach of such partys representation or warranties (in each
case, as if such representation or warranty was being made by such party as of
the date of such inaccuracy or breach) or covenants contained herein, in each
case, which would cause a condition to a partys obligations to consummate the
Transactions as set forth in _Article 6_ not to be satisfied. Such
disclosures shall not affect the rights of any party under this Agreement,
including with respect to indemnification.

 



 

5.8 _Intercompany Arrangements_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.8_ , at or
prior to the Closing, (a) the Sellers shall cause all Intercompany

5.10 _Additional Buyer Entities_. As soon as reasonably practicable following
the date hereof, such as would not reasonably be expected to delay the
expected Closing hereunder, Buyer Parent may, in consultation with Parent and
taking into account the reasonable comments of Parent, designate one or more
Subsidiaries of Buyer Parent that will be deemed a Buyer hereunder. Buyer
Parent will cause each such Subsidiary (a) to duly execute and deliver all
documents, agreements, and instruments required to be executed and delivered
by such Subsidiary as a Buyer under _Section 2.2_ or otherwise under this
Agreement and (b) if requested by Parent or any Governmental Entity, to
execute a joinder to this Agreement. Each Subsidiary so designated as a Buyer
pursuant to this _Section 5.8_ will be deemed a Buyer for all purposes
hereunder.

will sell, __ convey, transfer, assign or contribute to the Germany Entity all
of its assets which would otherwise constitute Purchased Assets, and the
Germany Entity will assume all Liabilities of the Germany Entity Seller which
would otherwise constitute Assumed Liabilities, in each case, in a form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer Parent and Parent (the " _German
Transaction_ ") and such assets and liabilities shall be considered the assets
and liabilities of the Germany Entity for all purposes under this Agreement.

7.2 _Indemnification by Sellers_.

 



 

(a) Subject to provisions of this _Article 7_, from and after the Closing
Date, each Seller, jointly and severally, shall indemnify Buyer Parent, Buyer,
their respective Affiliates and their respective current and former officers,
directors, partners, members, employees, successors and permitted assigns
(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") against any losses, out-
of-pocket costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and costs),
liabilities or other damages (collectively, " _Losses_ ") incurred by or
asserted against the Buyer Indemnified Parties as a result of or to the extent
relating to (i) any breach by Parent of any representation and warranty
contained in _Article 3_ or any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the
Sellers hereunder at or prior to the Closing, (ii) any breach of any covenant
or agreement of a Seller contained in this Agreement, (iii) any Retained
Liability, (iv) any Environmental Claim to the extent it relates to any act,
omission, event, condition, or circumstance occurring or existing on or prior
to the Closing Date, (v) the Sellers noncompliance with any Bulk Sales
Legislation to the extent relating to Retained Liabilities, (vi) (A) any Taxes
of any Purchased Entity with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and (B) the
Taxes of any Person (other than a Purchased Entity) with respect to which any
Purchased Entity is liable under Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract (excluding customary Tax indemnification provisions in commercial
contracts not primarily relating to Taxes), or otherwise, (vii) a claim for
plan funding or withdrawal liability by or to a defined benefit pension plan
maintained by or contributed to by a Seller or an Affiliate of a Seller
governed by ERISA (excluding any withdrawal liability due to actions or
omissions of Buyer and its Affiliates), (viii) any pension liability in
connection with inactive employees as of the Closing Date of the Germany
Entity Seller or the Germany Entity, and (ix) all Liabilities to the extent
arising out of the operation of the Businesses by a Purchased Entity prior to

existing prior to Closing with respect to a Purchased Entity (including
product liability claims, infringement of third-party Intellectual Property,
environmental matters, employment and labor matters, and Legal Proceedings),
in each case with respect to this clause _(ix)_ , to the extent that such
Liabilities would have constituted Retained Liabilities had such Purchased
Entity transferred its assets as a Seller party hereto.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Seller shall have any liability under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ above, unless the
aggregate of all Losses relating thereto for which Sellers would be liable,
but for this _Section 7.2(b)_, exceeds on a cumulative basis Three Million
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($3,500,000) **** (the " _Deductible_ "), and
then only to the extent such Losses exceed the Deductible; _provided_ that the

 



      
 

 



 

Sellers aggregate liability under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ shall in no event
exceed Fifty-Six Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($56,250,000) (the
" _Cap_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that the Cap and the Deductible shall not
apply to any Losses resulting from breaches of any Fundamental Representation
or fraud. In no event shall the aggregate liability of the Sellers for all
Losses claimed by Buyer Indemnified Parties against the Sellers exceed the
Purchase Price.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
from and after the Closing Date, no Seller shall be liable to, or indemnify,
any Buyer Indemnified Party for any Losses (i) to the extent that such Losses
result from or arise out of actions taken by a Buyer Indemnified Party or any
Purchased Entity or any of their respective Affiliates from and after the
Closing Date; provided that, subject to _Section 7.2(d)_, discovery by Buyer
of pre-existing conditions or events shall not constitute "actions taken" by
Buyer resulting in disqualification of an indemnity claim, (ii) that are
punitive, special, consequential, incidental, exemplary, in the nature of lost
profits, or any diminution in value of property or equity (except, in any such
case, to the extent that such damages are awarded to a third party in a Third
Party Claim), or (iii) to the extent that such matter was taken into account
in the final determination of either (A) the OCP Net Working Capital Amount
adjustment pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)(ii)_ hereof or (B) the DES Net Working
Capital Amount adjustment pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)(iii)_ hereof. The Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall not use "multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash
flow" or any similar valuation methodology in calculating the amount of any
Losses.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, any
claim for indemnity asserted by a Buyer Indemnified Party against any Seller
based on any of (A) _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ in respect of a breach of a
representation and warranty contained in _Section 3.13_, (B) _Section
7.2(a)(iv)_, or (C) _Sections 7.2(a)(iii)_ or _7.2(a)(ix)_ (to the extent
any such claim constitutes an Environmental Claim) (an " _Environmental
Indemnity Claim_ "), but excluding, for purposes of compliance with clause
(iii) below, any claim for indemnity asserted by a Buyer Indemnified Party
resulting from any condition discovered as a result of the work performed
under the Scope of Work, shall be subject to the following limitations:

 



 

(i) The Buyer Indemnified Party shall exercise reasonable best efforts to
mitigate the Losses arising from the Environmental Indemnity Claim, consistent
with the requirements of Environmental Law in light of the circumstances under
which the Losses were incurred.

 



 

(ii) In responding to the claim, event, condition, or circumstance giving rise
to the Environmental Indemnity Claim, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall
undertake any environmental response activities, including without limitation
sampling, investigation, analysis, assessment, removal, remediation, or other
similar work, in the most cost-effective and efficient manner consistent with
compliance with Environmental Law.

 



 

(iii) Following the Closing, unless (A) required to do so by a Governmental
Entity or to the extent necessary to comply with Environmental Law, (B) in
response to a third party providing credible information regarding an
environmental hazard at such Facility, (C) in response to any event,
condition, or circumstance constituting an environmental hazard of which Buyer
becomes

 



      
 

 



 

aware without looking for and which Buyer reasonably believes compels it to
take environmental response activities in order to avoid violating Laws or
creating additional Losses, or (D) required to do so in connection with a sale
of such Facility, Buyer shall not conduct any environmental response
activities, including sampling, investigation, analysis, assessment, removal,
remediation, or other similar work, concerning the soil, groundwater, surface
water or other environmental medium at, under, or adjacent to any Facility.

 



 

No Seller shall be liable for that portion of Losses included in an
Environmental Indemnity Claim which result from the Buyer Indemnified Partys
breach of any of the foregoing limitations. In the event Buyer fails to adhere
to any of the foregoing limitations, a Sellers liability for the
Environmental Indemnity Claim shall exclude those Losses, if any, that the
Buyer Indemnified Party would not have incurred had Buyer adhered to such
limitations. Any Buyer Indemnified Party asserting an Environmental Indemnity
Claim shall promptly share with Parent all non-privileged material
correspondence (and, upon execution of a customary joint defense agreement,
upon which the parties hereto agree that they shall mutually and reasonably
agree, all privileged material correspondence) relating to such Environmental
Indemnity Claim and the resulting Losses for which indemnity is sought,
including material correspondence with any governmental agencies or third
parties, and shall invite Parent and/or offer Parent a reasonable opportunity
to attend all meetings with the party or parties making an Environmental Claim
connected to such Losses.

 



 

(e) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall take, and shall cause the Purchased
Entities to use all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all Losses
upon and after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected
to give rise to Losses.

 



 

(f) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any Losses
relating to any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the
extent that the Buyer Indemnified Parties have already recovered Losses with
respect to such matter pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(g) The representations made in _Section 3.8_ of this Agreement are not
intended to serve as representations to, or a guarantee of, nor can they be
relied upon with respect to, Taxes attributable to any Post-Closing Tax
Periods, or Tax positions taken after the Closing Date.

 



 

7.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer Parent and Buyer, jointly and
severally, shall indemnify Sellers, their respective Affiliates and their
respective current and former officers, directors, partners, members,
employees, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnified Parties_ ") against any Losses which the Seller Indemnified
Parties suffer as a result of: (i) any breach of any representation or
warranty of Buyer Parent or Buyer under this Agreement or any certificate
delivered by or on behalf of Buyer Parent or Buyer hereunder, (ii) any non-
fulfillment or breach of any covenant, agreement or other provision of Buyer
Parent or Buyer set forth in this Agreement, and (iii) any Assumed
Liabilities.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Buyer Parent nor Buyer shall have any liability under _Section
7.3(a)(i)_ above, unless the aggregate of all Losses relating thereto for
which Buyer Parent and Buyer would be liable, but for this _Section 7.3(b)_,
exceeds the Deductible, and then only to the extent such Losses exceed the
Deductible; _provided_ that Buyer Parents and Buyers aggregate liability
under _Section 7.3(a)(i)_ shall in no event exceed the Cap; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Cap and the Deductible shall not apply to any Losses
resulting from breaches of any Fundamental Representation.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
from and after the Closing Date, neither Buyer Parent nor any Buyer shall be
liable to, or indemnify, any Seller Indemnified Party for any Losses (i) to
the extent that such Losses result from or arise out of actions taken by a
Seller Indemnified Party or any Purchased Entity or any of their respective
Affiliates from and after the Closing Date, or (ii) that are punitive,
special, consequential, incidental, exemplary, in the nature of lost profits,
or any diminution in value of property or equity (except, in any such case, to
the extent that such damages are awarded to a third party in a Third Party
Claim). The Seller Indemnified Parties shall not use "multiple of profits" or
"multiple of cash flow" or any similar valuation methodology in calculating
the amount of any Losses.

 



 

(d) The Seller Indemnified Parties shall take all commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate all Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event
which could reasonably be expected to give rise to Losses.

 



 

(e) The Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any Losses
relating to any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the
extent that the Seller Indemnified Parties have already recovered Losses with
respect to such matter pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

7.4 _Manner of Payment_. **** Any indemnification payment pursuant to this
_Article 7_ shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds
from the applicable indemnifying party to an account designated by each
applicable indemnified party within twenty (20) days after the determination
thereof.

 



 

7.5 _Defense of Claims_.

 



 

(a) _Third Party Claims._ Any Person making a claim for indemnification under
_Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_ (an " _Indemnitee_ ") shall notify the
indemnifying party (an " _Indemnitor_ ") of the claim in writing promptly
after receiving notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or
demand against the Indemnitee by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "),
describing the Third Party Claim, the amount thereof (if known and
quantifiable) and the basis thereof in reasonable detail; _provided_ that the
failure to so notify an Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its
obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnitor has been
damaged by such failure. Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in
the defense of such Third Party Claim giving rise to an Indemnitees claim for
indemnification at such Indemnitors expense, and at its option shall be
entitled to assume the defense thereof by appointing a reputable counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to be the lead counsel in connection
with such defense; _provided_ that the Indemnitee shall be entitled to
participate in the

 



      
 

 



 

defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such
purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , that the fees and expenses of such separate
counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitee and shall not be recoverable from
such Indemnitor under this _Article 7_ unless the Third Party Claim involves,
upon advice of counsel of the Indemnitee, a conflict of interest between the
Indemnitor and the Indemnitee in which case the reasonable costs of a single
counsel (plus local counsel) for all Indemnitees may be recoverable from the
Indemnitor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Indemnitor shall be entitled to
assume the conduct and control of the defense or settlement of a Third Party
Claim if (a) in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnitee the aggregate amount
of the potential obligations of the Indemnitee regarding such Third Party
Claim exceeds twice the amount of the remaining portion of the Cap, provided
that the restrictions in this clause (a) shall be applicable solely in
connection with an indemnity claim under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ except for
claims under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ involving Fundamental Representations, or
(b) such Third Party Claim seeks criminal penalties or non-monetary relief.
If the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such Third Party Claim; _provided_ that
the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) before entering into any
settlement of a Third Party Claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such
settlement or cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed
against the Indemnitee, if such settlement does not expressly and
unconditionally release the Indemnitee from all liabilities and obligations
with respect to such Third Party Claim or, solely in the case of an indemnity
claim under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ except for claims under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_
involving Fundamental Representations, if such settlement involves payment of
money in excess of the remaining portion of the Cap. If the Indemnitor assumes
such defense, the Indemnitor shall not be liable for any amount required to be
paid by the Indemnitee that exceeds, where the Indemnitee has unreasonably
withheld or delayed consent in connection with the proposed compromise or
settlement of a Third Party Claim, the amount for which that Third Party Claim
could have been settled pursuant to that proposed compromise or settlement. In
all cases, the Indemnitee shall provide its reasonable cooperation with the
Indemnitor in defense of Third Party Claims, including by making employees,
information and documentation reasonably available. If the Indemnitor shall
not assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee may
defend against such Third Party Claim as it deems appropriate; _provided_ that
the Indemnitee may not settle any such matter without the written consent of
the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) if the
Indemnitee is seeking or will seek indemnification hereunder with respect to
such matter.

 



 

(b) _Other Claims_. Any Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnitor of any claim
other than a Third Party Claim in writing promptly after receiving knowledge
of the basis for such claim, describing the claim, the amount thereof (if
known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof in reasonable detail; _provided_
that the failure to so notify an Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor
of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnitor has been
damaged by such failure.

 



 

7.6 _Determination of Loss Amount_. The amount of any Loss subject to
indemnification under _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_ shall be calculated
taking into account (i) any Tax Benefit actually realized in cash by the
Indemnitee on account of such Loss, (ii) any reserves or liabilities set forth
in the Financial Statements and/or Closing Statement relating to such Loss and
(iii) any insurance proceeds or other amounts under indemnification agreements
received by

 



      
 

 



 

the Indemnitee on account of such Loss. If the Indemnitee receives a Tax
Benefit (net of any tax detriment) on account of such Loss after an
indemnification payment is made to it, the Indemnitee shall promptly pay to
the Person or Persons that made such indemnification payment the amount of
such Tax Benefit at such time or times as and to the extent that such Tax
Benefit is realized by the Indemnitee. For purposes hereof, " _Tax Benefit_ "
shall mean any refund of Taxes actually received or reduction in the amount of
Taxes which otherwise would be paid by the Indemnitee, in each case computed
at the highest marginal tax rates applicable to the recipient of such benefit.
The Indemnitee shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek full
recovery under all insurance policies and/or indemnification agreements
covering any Loss to the same extent as they would if such Loss were not
subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance or other
recovery is received by any Indemnitee with respect to any Loss for which any
such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the lesser
of (a) the aggregate amount of the recovery (net of any reasonable third-party
costs actually incurred pursuing or obtaining such recovery, including
increased insurance premiums (if any) directly resulting from such recovery)
or (b) the amount of indemnification payments previously made by the
Indemnitors shall be made promptly to the Indemnitors that provided such
indemnity payments to such Indemnitee. For Tax purposes, the parties hereto
agree to treat all payments made under this _Article 7_ as adjustments to the
final Purchase Price.

 



 

7.7 _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless a party hereto in respect of a breach of representation, warranty or
covenant hereunder shall terminate when the applicable representation or
warranty or covenant terminates pursuant to _Section 7.1_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not
terminate with respect to any item as to which the party to be indemnified

 **ARTICLE 8. _ 
CERTAIN TAX MATTERS_**

 



 

8.1 _Books and Records; Cooperation_. Buyer, on one hand, and the Sellers, on
the other hand, agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to the other, upon
request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance related
to the Purchased Entities and the Purchased Assets, including access to books
and records in its possession, as is reasonably necessary for the filing of
all Tax Returns by Buyer or Sellers, the making of any election related to
Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Tax authority, and the prosecution
or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding related to any Taxes. Each of
Buyer, on one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall retain all books
and records with respect to Taxes pertaining to the Purchased Entities and the
Purchased Assets (other than books and records related solely to Excluded
Assets or Retained Liabilities) until the applicable statute of limitation
period has expired. Buyer, on one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand,
shall cooperate fully with the other in the conduct of any audit, litigation
or other Legal Proceeding related to Taxes involving the Purchased Entities
and the Purchased Assets (other than Taxes related solely to Excluded Assets
or Retained Liabilities). Buyer, on one hand, and the Sellers, on the other
hand, further agree, upon request from one party and provided that it does not
create (and might not potentially create) any significant burden to the other
party and at the expense of the requesting party, to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to
the Transactions).

 



 

8.2 _Transfer Taxes and VAT_.

 



 

(a) Buyer, on the one hand, and Parent (on behalf of Sellers), on the other
hand, shall be equally liable for all sales, use, transfer, land value,
documentary, stamp, registration, conveyance, goods and services, harmonized
sales or other similar Taxes imposed by any Tax jurisdiction domestic or
foreign (excluding VAT), and all recording or filing, notarial fees and other
similar costs incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "). The Purchase Price shall not include any
Transfer Taxes, and such Transfer Taxes shall be paid by Buyer and Parent in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 8.2_.

 



 

(b) All Tax Returns or other documentation related to such Taxes (" _Transfer
Tax Returns_ ") shall be filed by the party required to file each such
Transfer Tax Return pursuant to applicable Law or the provisions of any
agreement entered into in accordance with Section 2.3(e). The party required
to file a Transfer Tax Return shall submit such Transfer Tax Return (with
copies of any relevant schedules, work papers and other documentation) to the
non-filing party for such partys review, comment, approval and, as the case
may be, execution not less than twenty (20) days before the due date
(including extensions) for the filing of such Transfer Tax Return. If one
party is required to file a Transfer Tax Return or otherwise pay a Transfer
Tax bill, the other party (Buyer or Parent, as the case may be) shall pay half
of the Transfer

 



      
 

 



 

Taxes owing with respect to such Transfer Tax Return to such party no later
than the earlier of five (5) days prior to the due date of such Transfer Tax
Return.

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 8.10_ and _Section 8.11_, with
respect to assets transferred by a Seller resident in the European Union,
Switzerland or in a jurisdiction which has adopted a VAT regime similar to the
provisions of the VAT Directive, unless stated otherwise in the Preliminary
Allocation, the parties hereto assume that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement do constitute a supply of goods and that Article 19 of the VAT
Directive or similar applicable local Law provisions do not apply. Based on
this assumption, the Preliminary Allocation sets forth the assets in respect
of which VAT is owed by Buyer to the relevant Sellers together with the
Purchase Price allocated to such assets. Where any VAT set forth in the
Preliminary Allocation is recoverable by Buyer, the relevant Sellers shall
issue valid invoices meeting the requirements of the applicable VAT Law and on
a basis consistent with the Preliminary Allocation and Buyer shall pay to
Parent such VAT in addition to the Purchase Price allocated to such assets on
the later of Closing or receipt of a valid VAT invoice. Where any VAT set
forth in the Preliminary Allocation is irrecoverable by Buyer, the relevant
Sellers shall issue valid invoices meeting the requirements of the applicable
VAT Law and on a basis consistent with the Preliminary Allocation and Buyer
shall pay to Parent fifty percent of such VAT in addition to the Purchase
Price on the later of Closing and receipt of a valid VAT invoice. If and to
the extent the Final Allocation reflects values of the Purchased Assets
deviating from the amounts listed in the Preliminary Allocation, the relevant
Sellers shall issue adjusted valid invoices meeting the requirements of the
applicable VAT Law, and (i) where the purchase price for the assets is
increased and (x) VAT is recoverable by Buyer, Buyer shall pay to Parent an
amount equal to any additional VAT that becomes due as a result of such
increase, with payment to be made by Buyer on receipt of an appropriate VAT
invoice, or (y) VAT is irrecoverable by Buyer, Buyer shall pay to Parent an
amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of any additional VAT that becomes due as
a result of such increase, with payment to be made by Buyer on receipt of an
appropriate VAT invoice, or (ii) where the purchase price for any assets is
decreased, Parent or the appropriate Seller shall issue a VAT credit note or
equivalent to Buyer and shall, to the extent the Excess VAT is actually
recovered and retained by it or is creditable by Parent or such appropriate
Seller against any VAT liability of Parent or such appropriate Seller, (x) if
VAT is recoverable by Buyer, pay such Excess VAT to Buyer, or (y) if VAT is
irrecoverable by Buyer, pay fifty percent (50%) of such Excess VAT to Buyer,
and for the purposes of this _Section 8.2(c)(ii)_ "Excess VAT" means the VAT
actually paid (after deducting any previous refund under this _Section
8.2(c)(ii)_) by Buyer that would not have been payable had the purchase price
for the assets at all times reflected the relevant adjustment or amendment in
allocation provided that no payment shall be due under this _Section
8.2(c)(ii)_ from Parent or such appropriate Seller where any part of the
consideration (inclusive of VAT) payable pursuant to this Agreement which is
subject to adjustment under this _Section 8.2(c)(ii)_ remains outstanding.
The adjusted invoices shall be delivered within ten (10) Business Days after
the Final Allocation has been determined pursuant to _Section 1.7(a)_, and
the respective VAT amount shall be repaid or paid, as the case may be, within
ten (10) Business Days after delivery of the respective invoice. If a relevant
Tax authority decides that contrary to the assumptions made in the Preliminary
Allocation one or more of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement do
not constitute a supply of goods pursuant to Article 19 of the VAT Directive
or similar applicable local Law provisions, then the relevant Seller shall
issue within ten (10) Business Days after a binding decision of the relevant
Tax authority is available, adjusted valid invoices

 



      
 

 



 

meeting the requirements of the applicable VAT Law, and the Buyer shall make a
corresponding VAT payment to the relevant Sellers within ten (10) Business
Days after receipt of the adjusted invoice by the Buyer or, as the case may
be, the relevant Sellers shall make a VAT repayment to the Buyer within five
(5) Business Days after receipt by the relevant Seller of the respective
repayment from the relevant Tax authority.

 



 

8.3 _Property Taxes_. Sellers shall be responsible for and shall promptly pay
when due all Property Taxes levied with respect to the Purchased Assets
attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Buyer shall be responsible for
and shall promptly pay when due all Property Taxes levied with respect to the
Purchased Assets attributable to any Post-Closing Tax Period. All Property
Taxes levied with respect to the Purchased Assets for the Straddle Period
shall be apportioned between Buyer and Sellers based on the number of days of
such Straddle Period included in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number of
days of such Straddle Period included in the Post-Closing Tax Period. Sellers
shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such Property Taxes that is
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Buyer shall be liable for the
proportionate amount of such Property Taxes that is attributable to the Post-
Closing Tax Period. Upon receipt of any bill for such Property Taxes, Buyer or
Parent (on behalf of Sellers), as applicable, shall present a statement to the
other setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which each is entitled
under this _Section 8.3_ together with such supporting evidence as is
reasonably necessary to calculate the proration amount. The proration amount
shall be paid by the party owing it to the other within ten (10) days after
delivery of such statement. In the event that Buyer or any Seller makes any
payment for which it is entitled to reimbursement under this _Section 8.3_,
the applicable party shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no event
later than ten (10) days after the presentation of a statement setting forth
the amount of reimbursement to which the presenting party is entitled along
with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the
amount of reimbursement.

(45) days before the due date (including extensions) for the filing of each
such Tax Return. Parents approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Buyer shall cause the Purchased Entities to pay on
their due date to the relevant Tax authorities any Taxes as due on such Tax
Returns; _provided_ that Parent (on behalf of Sellers) shall reimburse Buyer
for any such Taxes paid within twenty (20) days of payment by such Purchased
Entities to the extent such Taxes are subject to Sellers obligation to
indemnify Buyer pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_.

 



 

(b) _Tax Periods Ending On or Before the Closing Date  Parent Consolidated,
Combined or Unitary Tax Returns_. For all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, Parent

Purchased Entities (other than the Germany Entity) to join in any
consolidated, unitary or combined Tax Return of Parent or of any Subsidiary of
Parent, as applicable, to the extent permitted by Law and consistent with past
practice, and Parent or such Subsidiary of Parent shall pay any Taxes
attributable to the Purchased Entities and with respect to the Purchased
Assets shown as due on such Tax Returns and, where applicable, the Purchased
Entities will promptly pay to Parent or to such Subsidiary of Parent any
amount that they are liable to pay in accordance with such consolidation Tax

Subsidiary of Parent, as the case may be; _provided_ that, prior to any such
payment is made, Parent shall promptly provide Buyer a computation of the
amounts owed to Parent by the Purchased Entities for Buyers review, comment
and approval. Buyers approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner
consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required by any applicable
Laws and regulations thereunder, or by any development in respect of the
interpretation of such Laws and regulations made by a competent court of law
or by an authority with power to impose Taxes.

 



 

(c) _Straddle Periods_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 8.4(b)_,
Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed any
Tax Returns of any of the Purchased Entities or with respect to the Purchased
Assets for all Straddle Periods. Buyer shall submit such Tax Returns (with
copies of any relevant schedules, work papers and other Tax Return
documentation) to Parent for Parents review, comment, and approval not less
than forty-five (45) days before the due date (including extensions) for the
filing of each such Tax Return. Parents approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. For purposes of this Agreement, Property
Taxes for any Straddle Period shall be allocated as described in _Section
8.3_, and for all other Taxes, the portion of such Taxes allocable to the
period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed equal to the amount which
would be payable if the relevant Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date.

the Independent Auditor will be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by
Parent.

 



 

8.5 _Characterization of Payments_. Any indemnification payments made pursuant
to this Agreement shall constitute an adjustment of the Purchase Price paid
for the Purchased Stock and the Purchased Assets for Tax purposes and shall be
treated as such by Buyer and the Sellers on their Tax Returns to the extent
permitted by Law.

 



 

8.6 _Actions After Closing_.

 



 

(a) After the Closing and on or before the last day of the taxable year in
which the Closing occurs, except with the prior written consent of Parent, the

amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return with respect to any Purchased
Entity for any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of
Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

 



 

8.7 _Contest Provisions_. If, subsequent to the Closing, any of Buyer or any
Purchased Entity receives notice of any audit, other administrative proceeding
or inquiry or judicial proceeding involving Taxes (a " _Tax Contest_ ") with
respect to any Tax Return of any Purchased Entity or with respect to the
Purchased Assets for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, then within 15 calendar days
after receipt of such notice, Buyer shall notify Parent of such notice;
_provided_ that the failure to so notify Parent shall not relieve Parent of
its indemnification obligations under this Agreement except to the extent that
Parent has been damaged by such failure. Parent shall have the right to
control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest, _provided_ , _however_
, that if any of the issues raised in such Tax Contest could have any adverse
impact on Taxes of Buyer or any Purchased Entity or with respect to the
Purchased Assets for a Post-Closing Tax Period, then Parent (i) shall afford
Buyer the opportunity to control jointly the conduct and resolution of the
portion of such Tax Contest that could have such an impact, (ii) keep Buyer

8.8 _Tax Refunds and Fiscal Unity Tax Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer, its Affiliates or any
Purchased Entity, and any amounts credited against Tax to which Buyer, its
Affiliates or any Purchased Entity become entitled, that relate to any Pre-
Closing Tax Periods (other than any credit or refund that (i) relates to
Transfer Taxes paid by Buyer pursuant to _Section 8.2_, (ii) is attributable
to the carryback of losses, credits or similar items generated by Buyer or an
Affiliate

 



      
 

 



 

of Buyer in any Tax period or by a Purchased Entity after the Closing Date in
any Post-Closing Tax Period, which such losses, credits or similar items may
not be carried forward under applicable Tax Law (but only to the extent such
carryback does not adversely affect Parent or any Parent Subsidiary Seller,
such adverse effect to exclude the actual reimbursement to Buyer of any such
credits or refunds), or (iii) is attributable to Taxes that are taken into
account in determining either (A) the OCP Net Working Capital Amount
adjustment pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)(ii)_ or (B) the DES Net Working
Capital Amount adjustment pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)(iii))_ shall be for the
account of the Sellers, and Buyer shall pay over to the Sellers any such
refund or the amount of any such credit within fifteen (15) days after receipt
or entitlement thereto. Any such payment shall constitute an adjustment of the
Purchase Price paid for the Purchased Stock and the Purchased Assets for Tax
purposes and shall be treated as such by Buyer and the Sellers on their Tax
Returns to the extent permitted by Law.

 



 

(b) To the extent the tax relevant income of a Purchased Entity not organized
under the laws of the United States or any state thereof relating to any Pre-
Closing Tax Periods is increased and such increase does not result in an
actual Tax payment of such Purchased Entity due to the fact that (i) Taxes are
assessed directly against the Sellers or a Sellers Affiliate due to the
existence of a fiscal unity for corporate income Tax or trade Tax purposes or
similar Tax consolidation schemes or (ii) the increase of the taxable income
of the relevant Purchased Entity is neutralized through current Tax losses
generated or Tax loss carry forwards used within a fiscal unity for corporate
income Tax, trade Tax or similar Tax consolidation schemes between such
Purchased Entity and the applicable Seller or Sellers Affiliate, Buyer shall
pay to the Sellers any Tax benefit of Buyer, its Affiliate or any Purchased
Entity resulting from a decrease of their taxable income for periods beginning
after the Closing Date (" _Fiscal Unity Tax Benefit_ ") to the extent such
decrease results from an increase in Taxes of Seller or its Affiliates under
this _Section 8.8(b)_. This _Section 8.8(b)_ applies, in particular, to any
Tax benefit resulting from the lengthening of amortization or depreciation
periods, higher depreciation allowances, a step-up in the Tax basis of assets,
the non-recognition of liabilities or provisions, higher deductions or losses
carried forward. The Fiscal Unity Tax Benefit is calculated in accordance with
the principles set out in _Section 7.6_ above. Any amount to be paid by Buyer
under this _Section 8.8(b)_ shall be due and payable within ten (10) days
after the relevant decision of the Tax authorities resulting in a Fiscal Unity
Tax Benefit has become non-appealable.

 



 

8.9 _Canadian Tax Covenants_.

 



 

(a) Promptly following Buyer Parents designation of a Canadian Buyer pursuant
to _Section 5.8_, Buyer Parent will provide to Parent such Canadian Buyers
registration numbers under Part IX of the _Excise Tax Act_ (Canada) and under
_An Act respecting the Quebec Sales Tax Act_ , and such registration numbers
will be maintained through the Closing. If applicable, Avery Dennison Canada
and Buyer will enter into an election under Section 167 of the _Excise Tax
Act_ (Canada) and Section 75 of _An Act respecting the Quebec Sales Tax_ on
the forms prescribed for such purposes in order to effect the transfer of the
Purchased Assets by Avery Dennison Canada to Buyer without payment of any
GST/HST or Quebec sales tax. Buyer shall file the elections forms referred to
above with the relevant tax authorities in the manner and within the times
prescribed under the relevant statute. Notwithstanding such elections, in the
event that it is determined by a Tax authority that GST/HST or Quebec sales
tax is payable on all or part of the Purchased Assets, Buyer agrees that such
GST/HST and/or QST shall, unless

 



      
 

 



 

already collected from Buyer, forthwith be paid by Buyer to Avery Dennison
Canada, and Buyer shall save Avery Dennison Canada and any other Sellers
harmless with respect to any such GST/HST or Quebec sales tax liability
arising herein, as well as any interest and penalty relating thereto. To the
extent that an election referred to in this _Section 8.9(a)_ is not
applicable, and with respect to any other Canadian Transfer Taxes not covered
by this _Section 8.9(a)_, Buyer shall promptly pay directly to the
appropriate Tax authority all applicable Canadian Transfer Taxes that may be
imposed or payable or collectible or incurred in connection with this
Agreement, provided that if any Canadian Transfer Taxes are required to be
collected by a Seller, 50% of such Canadian Transfer Taxes shall be paid by
Buyer to such Seller at the Closing or thereafter, as requested of or by the
applicable Seller. Seller shall pay to Buyer 50% of Canadian Transfer Taxes
(including Canadian sales tax, land transfer tax and GST/HST) nonrecoverable
by Buyer and paid to the appropriate Tax authority on the later of Closing or
the receipt of a valid invoice.

 



 

(b) _Section 22 ITA Election_. Each of Avery Dennison Canada and Buyer agree
to elect jointly in the prescribed form under Section 22 of the _Income Tax
Act_ (Canada) (" _ITA_ ") as to the sale of the accounts receivables
transferred by Avery Dennison Canada to Buyer as described in Section 22 of
the ITA and to designate in such election the face value of such accounts
receivables and an amount equal to the portion of the Purchase Price allocated
to such assets in accordance with _Section 1.7_, as the consideration paid by
Buyer therefor. Avery Dennison Canada shall file two copies of such election
with the Canada Revenue Agency forthwith after execution thereof, and, in any
event, with its Tax Return for the year of sale to make such election.

 



 

(c) _Subsection 20(24) ITA Election._ Buyer shall, if applicable, jointly
elect with Avery Dennison Canada to have Subsection 20(24) of the ITA apply to
any future obligations assumed by Buyer and for which Avery Dennison Canada
has already received payment.

UK Assets is treated as a TOGC by HMRC.

 



 

(b) Buyer hereby represents and warrants to Parent that:

before Closing Buyer shall provide Parent with a copy of its UK certificate of

(ii) Buyer intends to carry on the same kind of business in relation to the UK
Assets with effect from Closing as that carried on by the UK Seller prior to
Closing and does not intend to liquidate such business.

Added Tax (Special Provisions) Order 1995 does not apply to Buyer.

 



 

(d) If, notwithstanding the provisions of _Sections 8.9(a)_ and _(b)_ above,
any relevant Tax authority determines that VAT is chargeable in respect of the
supply of all or any

 



      
 

 



 

part of the UK Assets under this Agreement or in respect of any other payment
made by Buyer or any other supplies made to Buyer, in each case pursuant to
this Agreement, then Parent shall notify Buyer in writing of that
determination within five (5) Business Days of its being so advised by such
Tax authority and Buyer shall:

 



 

(i) pay to Parent in addition to the Purchase Price allocated to the UK Assets
in accordance with _Section 1.7(a)_ or any other relevant payment made by
Buyer, a sum equal to 50% of the amount of VAT nonrecoverable by Buyer and
100% of the amount of VAT recoverable by Buyer as determined by the relevant
Tax authority or Parent, as appropriate, to be so chargeable, on the later of
Closing or receipt of an appropriate VAT invoice; or

 



 

(ii) where the liability for VAT in respect of any supply is a liability of
Buyer (whether under section 8 UKVATA or similar or equivalent provisions in
any other jurisdiction), Buyer shall promptly pay all applicable VAT to the
relevant Tax authority and shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent against
any liability for VAT recoverable by Buyer and or any Liability that arises as

for VAT, fines, interest or penalties arising to Parent or any member of the
Sellers as a result of the transfer of the UK Assets being treated, in whole
or in part, as anything other than a TOGC.

 



 

(f) In the event that the Purchase Price is adjusted in accordance with
_Section 1.6(c)_, and/or the allocation of the Purchase Price to any UK
Assets is amended, the parties agree to co-operate in good faith to correct
the respective invoices and VAT returns, and in particular:

 



 

(i) where the purchase price for the UK Assets is increased, Buyer shall pay
to Parent an amount equal to any additional VAT that becomes due as a result
of such increase, with payment to be made by Buyer on receipt of an
appropriate VAT invoice; and

 



 

(ii) where the purchase price for any UK Assets is decreased, Parent or the
appropriate Seller shall issue a VAT credit note or equivalent to Buyer and
shall, to the extent the Excess VAT is actually recovered and retained by it
or is creditable by Parent or such appropriate Seller against any VAT
liability of Parent or such appropriate Seller, pay such Excess VAT to Buyer,
and for the purposes of this _Section 8.10(f)(ii)_ " _Excess VAT_ " means the
VAT actually paid (after deducting any previous refund under this _Section
8.10(f)(ii)_) by Buyer that would not have been payable had the purchase price
for the UK Assets at all times reflected the relevant adjustment or amendment
in allocation provided that no payment shall be due under this _Section
8.10(f)(ii)_ from Parent or such appropriate Seller where any part of the
consideration (inclusive of VAT) payable pursuant to this Agreement which is
subject to adjustment under this _Section 8.10(f)(ii)_ remains outstanding.

 



       
 

 



 

8.11 _German VAT_.

 



 

(a) The German Transaction according to _Section 5.11_ and the German IP
Transaction according to _Section1.1(c)_ shall be outside the scope of German
VAT as the Germany Holding Entity, the Germany Entity Seller and the Germany
Entity form a fiscal unity for VAT purposes (Section 2 para. 2 no. 2 GVATA).
In light of such fiscal unity, the parties intend, and shall use reasonable
endeavors to procure, that the German Transaction and the German IP
Transaction will be effected prior to Closing. If, contrary to the
understanding in the foregoing sentences, the relevant Tax authority
determines that the German Transaction and the German IP Transaction are not
effected within a fiscal unity for VAT purposes, the parties hereto intend,
and shall use reasonable efforts to procure that both the German Transaction
and the German IP Transaction will be treated as a TOGC ( _Gesch
aftsveraußerung im Ganzen_) within the scope of Section 1 para. 1a sent. 1
GVATA by the German Tax authorities.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto agree that the sale and transfer of the shares in the
Germany Entity from the Germany Entity Seller to Buyer Parent or a designated
Buyer entity shall be exempt from VAT according to Section 4 no. 8 GVATA.

 



 

(c) Buyer and the Germany Entity each hereby represents, warrants and
covenants to Parent that:

 



 

(i) It is an entrepreneur ( _Unternehmer_ ) within the scope of Section 2
para. 1 GVATA;

 



 

(ii) It acquires the German Assets for purposes of its business within the
scope of Section 1 para. 1a sent. 1 GVATA; and

 



 

(iii) It will carry on the same kind of business in relation to the German
Assets with effect from Closing as that carried on by the Germany Entity
Seller prior to Closing and does, in particular, not intend to liquidate such
business.

 



 

(d) If, notwithstanding the provisions of _Sections 8.11(a)_ , _(b)_ and
_(c)_ above, the relevant Tax authority determines that VAT is chargeable in
respect of the supply of all or any part of the German Assets under this
Agreement or in respect of any other payment made by Buyer or the Germany
Entity or any other supplies made to Buyer or the Germany Entity, in each case
pursuant to this Agreement, then the Germany Entity Seller shall notify Buyer
and the Germany Entity in writing of that determination and send, or cause to
be sent, an appropriate VAT invoice to the Buyer and the Germany Entity, as
the case may be, within five (5) Business Days of its being so advised by such
Tax authority and Buyer and the Germany Entity shall:

 



 

(i) pay to the Germany Entity Seller or the Germany Holding Entity, as the
case may be, in addition to the Purchase Price allocated to the German Assets
in accordance with _Section 1.7(a)_ or any other relevant payment made by
Buyer or the Germany Entity, a sum equal to 50% of the amount of VAT
nonrecoverable by Buyer or the Germany Entity and 100% of the amount of VAT
recoverable by Buyer and/or the Germany Entity determined by the relevant Tax
authority or the Germany Entity Seller, as appropriate, to be so chargeable,
on the later of Closing or receipt of an appropriate VAT invoice. Any
additional VAT charged from Germany Entity Seller or Germany

 



      
 

 



 

Holding Entity to Germany Entity will be due for payment to the extent the
additional VAT is actually recovered and retained by the Germany Entity or is
creditable by the Germany Entity against any VAT liability of the Germany
Entity; or

 



 

(ii) where the liability for VAT in respect of any supply is a liability of
Buyer or the Germany Entity, Buyer shall promptly pay all applicable VAT to
the relevant Tax authority and shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent, the
Germany Holding Entity, and/or the Germany Entity Seller against any liability
for VAT recoverable by Buyer and/or the Germany Entity or any Liability that
arises as a result of any failure by Buyer to comply with this _Section
8.11_. Parent shall pay Buyer a sum equal to 50% of the amount of such VAT
nonrecoverable by Buyer and/or the Germany Entity on the later of Closing or
receipt of an appropriate VAT invoice.

 



 

(e) In the event that the Purchase Price is adjusted in accordance with
_Section 1.6(c)_, and/or the allocation of the Purchase Price to any German
Assets is amended, the parties agree to co-operate in good faith to correct
the respective invoices and VAT returns, and in particular:

 



 

(i) where the purchase price for any German Assets is increased, Buyer shall
pay to Germany Entity Seller or the Germany Holding Entity, as the case may
be, an amount equal to any additional VAT that becomes due as a result of such
increase, with payment to be made by Buyer on receipt of an appropriate VAT
invoice and to the extent the additional VAT is actually recovered and
retained by it or is creditable by the Germany Entity against any VAT
liability of the Germany Entity; and

 



 

(ii) where the purchase price for any German Assets is decreased, the Germany
Entity Seller or the Germany Holding Entity, as the case may be, shall issue
an amended appropriate VAT invoice to Buyer and the Germany Entity Seller
shall, to the extent the Excess VAT is actually recovered and retained by it
or is creditable by the Germany Entity Seller against any VAT liability of the
Germany Entity Seller, pay such Excess VAT to Buyer, and for the purposes of
this _Section 8.11(e)(ii)_ " _Excess VAT_ " means the VAT actually paid
(after deducting any previous refund under this _Section 8.11(e)(ii)_) by
Buyer that would not have been payable had the purchase price for the German
Assets at all times reflected the relevant adjustment or amendment in
allocation provided that no payment shall be due under this _Section
8.11(e)(ii)_ from the Germany Entity Seller or the Germany Holding Entity, as
the case may be, where any part of the consideration (inclusive of VAT)
payable pursuant to this Agreement which is subject to adjustment under this
_Section 8.11(e)(ii)_ remains outstanding.

before distributing any communications approved by the relevant Seller to any
Business Employee whether relating to employee benefits, post-Closing terms of
employment or otherwise. Buyer and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible
for all obligations and Liabilities to the Business Employees resulting from,
whether directly or indirectly, Buyers acts or omissions in relation to such
notification and consultation process, except (A) such acts or omissions to

Liabilities result from a failure of any Seller to comply with its obligations
under this Agreement. Seller and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible
for all obligations and Liabilities to the Business Employees resulting from,
whether directly or indirectly, Sellers acts or omissions in relation to such
notification and consultation process, except (x) such acts or omissions to

(iii) The parties agree that the Transfer of Undertakings applies to the sale
and purchase of each of the Businesses and certain of the Purchased Assets
under this Agreement. Subject to the right of an ARD Business Employee to

such ARD Business Employee will have effect after the Closing Date as if
originally between Buyer or an Affiliate thereof and that ARD Business
Employee to the extent required by the Transfer of Undertakings.

 



 

(iv) With respect to each Business Employee who is employed by any of the
Sellers or any Affiliate of the Sellers (other than any Purchased Entity)
immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Non-Purchased Entity Employees_ "),
Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, (A) for the Non-Purchased
Entity Employees who are not ARD Business Employees, extend written offers of
employment (or, with respect to Non-Purchased Entity Employees providing
services in Mexico, provide transfer notices) (such offer or transfer notice,
as applicable, an " _Offer_ "), in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Sellers (which has been provided to the Sellers for review and comment at
least

 



      
 

 



 

five (5) Business Days prior to use thereof), no later than ten (10) Business
Days (or such longer period as is required by Law) prior to the Closing, but

assume the employment of such ARD Business Employees on the Closing Date in
accordance with all applicable Laws, and (C) for the Business Employees whose
employment is expected by the parties to automatically transfer to Buyer or an
Affiliate thereof pursuant to the Transfer of Undertakings but whose
employment does not in fact transfer to Buyer or an Affiliate thereof for
reasons other than the Business Employees objecting to transfer (if such
objection would prevent their transfer to Buyer or Affiliate thereof under
applicable Law), extend an Offer, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Sellers, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date. Buyer and
its Affiliates shall, if and to the extent reasonably requested by the
Sellers, cooperate with the Sellers and their Affiliates to jointly inform the
ARD Business Employees about the Transfer of Undertakings prior to the
Closing. Each Offer extended to a Non-Purchased Entity Employee shall (I) be
for employment by Buyer or an Affiliate thereof as of the Closing Date, (II)
for the employees set forth on _Schedule 9.1(b)(iv)_ (" _Transferred

that, in the aggregate, are at least substantially equivalent to the
compensation and benefits coverage provided to such employee immediately prior

continuing employment in a substantially equivalent position with compensation
and benefits that are at least equivalent to the compensation and benefits
coverage provided to such Mexican Non-Purchased Entity Employee immediately
prior to the Closing, (IV) for all other non-US Non-Purchased Entity

location as the applicable US Non-Purchased Entity Employee is employed
immediately prior to the Closing in a reasonably appropriate position with a
base pay rate and annual bonus opportunity that are substantially equivalent
to the base pay rate and annual bonus opportunity provided to such employee
immediately prior to Closing, and (VI) require that such Non-Purchased Entity
Employee acknowledge and agree that, as of the Closing Date, he or she will
have resigned from, or voluntarily ceased, employment with each Seller
employing such Non-Purchased Entity Employee. In addition, all Offers shall be
made in accordance with all applicable Laws. Sellers and Buyer shall take all
reasonable actions necessary or appropriate to cause the Non-Purchased Entity
Employees to accept Buyers Offers or to otherwise become employed by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates in a jurisdiction where the Transfer of Undertakings
applies (including making application for (and using commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain) any work permit or visa, employment pass, or other legal or
regulatory approval

 



      
 

 



 

for employment). Neither Sellers nor any of their Affiliates will seek to
induce any Non-Purchased Entity Employee to reject any Offer from Buyer or any
of its Affiliates made in accordance with the terms hereof, and such Non-
Purchased Entity Employees who accept Offers shall become employees of Buyer
or Affiliates immediately following the Closing and shall then cease to be
employees of any Seller or Affiliates. All Purchased Entity Employees, Non-
Purchased Entity Employees who accept Offers, and Non-Purchased Entity
Employees whose employment automatically transfers pursuant to a Transfer of
Undertakings are referred to herein as the " _Transferring Employees_."

 



 

(v) Buyer Parent and Buyer, jointly and severally, shall indemnify each of the
Sellers and their respective Affiliates against any Liabilities which the
Sellers and their respective Affiliates incur arising from Sellers
termination of any Transferred Executive, any person who is a current part-
time or full-time employee of any Purchased Entity, or any ARD Business
Employee who, in connection with the Transactions, is entitled to object to
the transfer of their employment to Buyer or any Purchased Entity and who does
not become a Transferring Employee (" _Non-Transferring Employee_ ") for (A)
severance pay and benefits and (B) notice pay, in each case, that is required
to be paid by Sellers to such Business Employee under any applicable Employee
Plan, Law or Order, provided that Sellers give written notice to Buyer of
their intent to terminate such Non-Transferring Employee within thirty (30)
days following such Non-Transferring Employees objection to transfer.

 



 

(vi) The Sellers shall provide to Buyer and its Affiliates all employment
records for each Transferring Employee that (A) are required to be provided to
Buyer and its Affiliates under and subject to applicable Law or (B) are
reasonably requested in writing by Buyer or any of its Affiliates on or prior
to the 30th day following the Closing Date and are permitted to be provided to
Buyer and its Affiliates under applicable Law. Buyer and its Affiliates shall
ensure that all such records are used, processed and stored in accordance with
applicable Law. Buyer and its Affiliates shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Sellers and their Affiliates from and against any statutory, common law or
other claims that arise from the use of such employment records by Buyer or
its Affiliates other than in compliance with applicable Law or Order. To the
extent permitted by Law, the Sellers and their Affiliates shall be permitted
to retain a copy of any employment records provided to Buyer and its
Affiliates pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)(vi)_ or otherwise.

 



 

(vii) Except as otherwise set forth herein (and in no way limiting any other

obligations (including any compensation payable during (or in lieu of) a
mandatory termination notice period, any payments pursuant to an Order of a
court having jurisdiction over the parties and any payments in connection with
accrued annual leave, long service leave or similar accrued rights) and for
any other claim, cost, Liability or

 



      
 

 



 

obligation (whether related to compensation, benefits or otherwise), in each
case, arising out of or in connection with the failure of Buyer or its
Affiliates to make an Offer to any Non-Purchased Entity Employee (except for
those Persons set forth on _Annex B-1_ ) or to continue the employment of any
Transferred Executive (except as set forth on _Annex B-2_ solely to the extent
that such employees are terminated prior to the one-year anniversary of the
Closing Date), in each case, in accordance with this Agreement and applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such indemnification shall be limited
and reduced to the extent that such Liabilities, obligations and costs arise
solely from or in connection with the failure of Sellers to comply with any
Sellers obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

 



 

(viii) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall be interpreted to
require Buyer to continue the employment of any Transferring Employee, or
confer on any Transferring Employee any right to continued employment with the
Buyer, for any period of time following the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) _Post-Closing Benefits_.

 



 

(i) Through December 31, 2013, Buyer agrees that it will, and will cause its
Affiliates to, provide to each Transferring Employee (A) compensation and
benefits coverage that (x) with respect to each Mexican Non-Purchased Entity
Employee, are at least equivalent to the compensation and benefits coverage
provided to such Mexican Non-Purchased Entity Employee immediately prior to
the Closing, (y) with respect to each other non-US Transferring Employee, in
the aggregate, are substantially equivalent to the compensation and benefits
coverage provided to such Transferred Executive immediately prior to Closing,
in accordance with applicable Law, and (z) with respect to each Transferred
Executive, in the aggregate, are at least substantially equivalent to the
compensation and benefits coverage provided to such Transferred Executive
immediately prior to Closing, and (B) with respect to each US Transferring
Employee other than the Transferred Executives, a base pay rate and annual
bonus opportunity that are substantially equivalent to the base pay rate and
annual bonus opportunity provided to such employees immediately prior to
Closing. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer
with transitioning the Transferring Employees to its benefit plans. Such
assistance shall include coordinating with their current benefit plan vendors
to provide reasonable information and reports needed by Buyer for such
transition in a timely manner.

 



 

(ii) Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall (or shall cause its Affiliates
to), pursuant to employee benefit plans, policies, programs and arrangements
established or maintained by Buyer and its Affiliates (the " _Buyer Plans_ ")
(A) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
Transferring Employees under Buyer Plans, other than limitations or waiting
periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and that
have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date under the corresponding
Employee Plan (subject to Buyers ability to obtain any required consent of
any insurer with respect to any Buyer Plan without unreasonable effort or
expense), (B) provide each Transferring Employee with credit under Buyer Plans
for any co-

 



      
 

 



 

insurance and deductibles paid under the corresponding Employee Plans prior to
the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible and/or co-insurance
for the year in which the Closing Date occurs (subject to the receipt by the
applicable vendors, or if not available, the employees, of any information
which is reasonably necessary regarding such co-insurance and deductibles
previously paid) or otherwise provide each Transferring Employee with
additional compensation or benefits that are, in the aggregate, substantially
equivalent to the value of such credit, and (C) (x) to the extent the Sellers
or their Affiliates are required by Law or Order to pay or otherwise
compensate Transferring Employees for accrued, unused vacation, personal or
sick days, pay the Sellers an amount equal to the aggregate amount of such
payment or compensation by the Sellers and their Affiliates to such
Transferring Employees and (y) to the extent the Sellers and their Affiliates
are not required by Law or Order to pay or otherwise compensate Transferring
Employees for accrued, unused vacation, personal or sick days, honor all
vacation, personal and sick days accrued by such Transferring Employees under
the applicable Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing. To the extent
not inconsistent with applicable Laws, for purposes of determining eligibility
to participate, vesting and determination of the level of benefits (but not
accrual or entitlement to benefits under any defined benefit pension plan or
the level of company matching contributions under any defined contribution
pension plan) for Transferring Employees under all Buyer Plans, Buyer shall or
shall cause its Affiliates to recognize service with the Sellers and their
Affiliates to the same extent recognized under the corresponding Employee
Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(iii) No employee, dependent or beneficiary shall be a third party beneficiary
of the obligations of this subsection (c).

 



 

(d) _WARN Act_. On or before the Closing Date, the Sellers shall deliver to
Buyer a list of "employment loss" (as defined in the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act and implementing regulations (" _WARN_ "))
involving Business Employees providing services in the United States, by
location, occurring in the ninety (90) day period preceding the Closing Date;
Sellers will upon reasonable request provide Buyer with sufficient additional
information about the number of employees employed as each such location and
other WARN-related data for Buyer to determine whether WARN notice may be
required. Buyer shall be responsible for providing or discharging any and all
notifications, benefits and liabilities to employees and governmental entities
under WARN, or any similar state or local Law relating to plant closings,
employee separations or severance pay from Buyer that are first required to be
provided or discharged on or after the Closing Date (including as to employees
identified on the pre-Closing list provided to Buyer pursuant to this _Section
9.1(d)_) if actions by Buyer on or after the Closing Date result in such a
notice requirement.

 



 

(e) _Defined Contribution Plans_. As soon as practicable following the Closing
Date, Buyer (or one of its Affiliates) shall take all action necessary or
appropriate to establish one or more defined contribution plans intended to be
tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code for the benefit of the
Transferring Employees (collectively, the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_").
Transferring Employees shall have their continuous service as defined in the
Avery Dennison Corporation Employee Savings Plan (the " _Seller 401(k)
Plan_") credited under the Buyer 401(k) Plan solely for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting. As soon as reasonably

 



      
 

 



 

practicable after such date as the Sellers have been provided (i) evidence
that Buyer has established a trust to hold the assets of the corresponding
Buyer 401(k) Plan, and (ii) that the Buyer 401(k) Plan is qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code and that the trust holding the assets of the Buyer
401(k) Plan is exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code but no earlier than
seventy-five (75) days after the Effective Date (the date of transfer, the "
_Transfer Date_ "), the Sellers shall cause the accounts under the Seller
401(k) Plan of each participant who is a Transferring Employee to be
transferred to the Buyer 401(k) Plan. Such transfer shall include a transfer
of the applicable assets from the trust pursuant to the Seller 401(k) Plan to
the trust pursuant to the Buyer 401(k) Plan in accordance with Section 414(l)
of the Code. Such transfer of assets shall be in cash but shall include any
promissory notes or other evidences of indebtedness with respect to
outstanding plan loans to Transferring Employees who are participants in the
Seller 401(k) Plan. On or prior to the Transfer Date, the Seller shall cause
all unvested accrued benefits to become fully vested for the Transferring
Employees for the period up to and including the Closing Date. No later than
thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, the Sellers will prepare and
deliver to Buyer a schedule setting forth (i) the names of the Transferring
Employees who participate under the Seller 401(k) Plan, (ii) details of any
outstanding plan loans from the Seller 401(k) Plan to the Transferring
Employees, and (iii) the account balances of such Transferring Employees under
the Seller 401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date.

 



 

(f) _Other Pension Plans_.

 



 

(i) On and after the Closing Date, the Purchased Entities, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall be responsible for, and assume all Liabilities related to,
the Transferring Pension Plans and none of the Sellers or their Affiliates
will have any Liability or obligations on or after the Closing Date with
respect to the Transferring Pension Plans (subject to the receipt by Buyer and
its Affiliates of all information reasonably necessary to administer and
operate such Transferring Pension Plans following the Closing Date).

 



 

(ii) If a Seller or any of its Affiliates retains employees who are
participants in a Transferring Pension Plan, then such Seller or Affiliate
thereof will use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) ensure that each such
employee ceases to participate in the Transferring Pension Plan prior to the
Closing Date, and (B) cause each such employees accrued benefits under such
plan to be transferred from the Transferring Pension Plan to another employee
benefit plan of the Seller or an Affiliate thereof (the " _Retained Pension
Plan_ "). If the transfer described in _Section 9.1(f)(ii)(B)_ does not occur
prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate to ensure the
transfer to the Retained Pension Plan is made as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date.

 



 

(iii) Buyer and the Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) ensure that each Business
Employee who is a participant in the Swiss pension plan sponsored by a Seller
(the " _Retained Swiss Plan_ ") ceases to participate in the Retained Swiss
Plan as of the Closing Date, (B) cause each such Business Employees vested
credit benefits under the Retained Swiss Plan to be transferred to the
applicable employee benefit plan(s) of Buyer or

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliate thereof (the " _Buyer Swiss Plan_ ") in accordance with applicable
Law governing such plan, (C) ensure that a transfer of the amount of assets
required to be transferred by applicable Law in respect of vested credit
benefits described in Section 9.1(f)(iii)(B) is made from the Retained Swiss
Plan to the Buyer Swiss Plan and (D) in the event that the actuarial value of
the vested credit benefits transferred in (B) above (as determined by an
independent actuary mutually agreed upon by the parties using GAAP) is greater
than the amount of assets transferred under (C) above, then cause the amount
of such excess to (x) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be
transferred from the Retained Swiss Plan to the Buyer Swiss Plan or otherwise
(y), be paid by Sellers or any of their Affiliates to Buyer.

 



 

(iv) Buyer and the Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) ensure that each Business
Employee who is a participant in the Mexican pension plan sponsored by a
Seller (the " _Retained Mexican Plan_ ") ceases to participate in the Retained
Mexican Plan as of the Closing Date, (B) cause each such Business Employees
benefits under the Retained Mexican Plan to be transferred to the applicable
employee benefit plan of Buyer or Affiliate thereof in accordance with Mexican
Law and regulations governing such plan, and (C) ensure that a transfer of
assets equal in value to the amount of benefits described in _Section
9.1(f)(iv)(B)_ is made from the Retained Mexican Plan to the applicable
employee benefit plan of Buyer or Affiliate thereof.

 



 

(v) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer (or one of its
Affiliates) shall take all action necessary to establish or designate one or
more Buyer Plans that shall qualify as a successor pension plan under the
provisions of the _Pension Benefits Act_ (R.S.O. 1990, CHAPTER P.8) (Ontario)
or similar Law of all Canadian jurisdictions in which each Transferring
Employee is employed (" _Canadian Successor Pension Plan_ ") for each Employee
Plan that qualifies as a pension plan under the _Pension Benefits Act_ (R.S.O.
1990, CHAPTER P.8) (Ontario) or similar Law of each Canadian jurisdiction in
which a Transferring Employee is employed (" _Canadian Predecessor Pension
Plan_ "). All Transferring Employees shall be credited with service for the
purposes of eligibility and vesting under each Canadian Successor Pension Plan
for all periods of employment credited under each Canadian Predecessor Pension
Plan.

 



 

(vi) On or before the Closing Date, the Germany Entity shall transfer all
pension Liabilities and pension assets relating to inactive employees of the
Germany Entity as of the Closing Date to an Affiliate of Parent.

 



 

(g) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this _Section 9.1_ shall
create any third party beneficiary right in any Person other than the parties
to this Agreement, including any current or former Business Employee, any
participant in any Employee Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or
any right to continued employment with either of the Businesses, the Sellers,
Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section 9.1_
shall constitute an amendment to any Employee Plan or any other plan or
arrangement covering Business Employees.

 



       
 

 



 

9.2 _Post-Closing Access and Cooperation_. Following the Closing, in the event
that, and for so long as, any Seller or its Affiliate is actively contesting
or defending against any charge, audit, complaint, action, suit, proceeding,
hearing, investigation, grievance, arbitration, claim, Legal Proceeding, or
demand in connection with (a) any transaction contemplated by the Transaction
Documents or (b) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition,
activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act,
or transaction relating to periods prior to the Closing and involving either
of the Businesses, at Sellers sole cost and expense, Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Purchased Entities) will reasonably cooperate with such
contesting or defending party and its counsel in the contest or defense, make
available their personnel, provide such Intellectual Property rights or
participate as a party to the extent reasonably requested to pursue or defend
any such contest or defense, and provide such testimony and other information
as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with such contest or defense.
Further, subject to the Transition Services Agreement, the Supply Agreement
and the Trademark Coexistence Agreement, with respect to the respective
matters covered thereby, and without limiting the obligations set forth in
_Section 8.1_, from and after the Closing, each party hereto (the "
_Disclosing Party_ ") agrees that it will cooperate with and make available to
the other party (the " _Recipient Party_ "), during normal business hours and
upon reasonable notice, (i) in the case Buyer is the Recipient Party, all
books, records, documents and other information related to either of the
Businesses, (ii) in the case the Sellers are the Recipient Party, all Books
and Records and any other books, records, documents and information related to
any business or operations conducted by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
other than the Businesses and (iii) employees of the Disclosing Party (without
substantial disruption of employment), in each case which are necessary or
useful in connection with any audit, investigation or dispute, any litigation
or investigation or any other matter requiring any such books, records or
other documents, information or employees for any reasonable business purpose.
Unless otherwise consented to in writing by Parent, Buyer Parent shall and
shall cause Buyer and the Purchased Entities not to, for a period of six (6)
years after the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any books
and records or information related to either of the Businesses or portions
thereof relating to periods prior to the Closing Date. Except in connection
with uses contemplated by this Agreement, all information received from the
Disclosing Party pursuant to this _Section 9.2_ (the " _Section 9.2
Information_") shall be kept confidential by the Recipient Party, subject to
any disclosure that is required to be made by the Recipient Party in order to
comply with applicable Laws, Orders or the rules or regulations of any
securities exchange upon which its securities are traded. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Section 9.2 Information shall not include information that (a)
is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a

possession prior to it being furnished to such Recipient Party by Buyer (in
the case of any Seller) or any Seller (in the case of Buyer), (c) becomes
available to the Recipient Party on a non-confidential basis from a source
other than Buyer (in the case of any Seller) or any Seller (in the case of
Buyer) or (d) is independently developed by the Recipient Party without
violating the Recipient Partys obligations hereunder.

 



 

9.3 _Publicity_. Except as required by applicable Laws, Orders or applicable
rules or regulations of any securities exchange upon which its securities are
traded, without prior written approval of Buyer and Parent, none of Buyer, the
Sellers, the Purchased Entities or their respective Affiliates shall issue any
press release or make any public statement regarding this Agreement and the
Transactions.

 



      
 

 



 

9.4 _Non-Competition_.

 



 

(a) In consideration of Buyer entering into this Agreement and in order for
Buyer to enjoy the full benefits of the Purchased Assets and Purchased
Entities, from the Closing Date until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, Parent shall not, directly or indirectly, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates (each, a " _Restricted Party_ ") not to, directly

this _Section 9.4_ (including any component of the definition of Restricted
Businesses) shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be
unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, then any such provisions shall not be
deemed void, and the parties hereto agree that said limits may be modified by
the court and that said covenant contained in _Section 9.4(a)_ shall be
amended in accordance with said modification, it being specifically agreed by
the parties that it is their continuing desire that this covenant be enforced
to the full extent of its terms and conditions, and if a court finds the full

covenant so as to provide the fullest extent of its terms and conditions
permitted under applicable Law.

respect to any breach or threatened breach of any such provision, as may be
available from any court of competent jurisdiction and (ii) in any action to

connection with any such enforcement activities if Buyer is the prevailing
party. Parent hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of a
bond in connection with seeking any such equitable relief.

Sellers and their Subsidiaries shall not be prohibited from (i) initiating
searches for employees through the use of general advertisement or through the
engagement of firms to conduct searches that are not targeted or focused on

Subsidiaries, at the time of solicitation.

 



 

(c) If any provision of this _Section 9.5_ is deemed invalid, illegal, or
incapable of being enforced by reason of any rule of law or of any public
policy, all other provisions of this _Section 9.5_ shall, nevertheless,
remain in full force and effect and no provision shall be deemed dependent
upon any other provision unless so expressed herein. A court of competent
jurisdiction may so modify the objectionable provision as to make it valid,
reasonable, and

 



      
 

 



 

enforceable. The parties intend that the restrictions imposed by this
Agreement be given the construction that renders their provisions valid and

11.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Annexes and the
Exhibits hereto, the Disclosure Letter and the other agreements, documents and
written understandings referred to herein or otherwise entered into or
delivered by the parties hereto on the date of this Agreement (including the
Ancillary Agreements), together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute
the entire agreement among the parties hereto and supersede all other prior
covenants, agreements, undertakings, obligations, promises, arrangements,
communications, representations and warranties, whether oral or written, by
any party hereto or by any director, officer, employee, agent, Affiliate or
Representative of any party hereto.

 



 

11.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder may be assigned by any party hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto; _provided_ that Buyer may assign
its rights and interests to any of its Affiliates unless such assignment would
prevent, delay or otherwise interfere with the consummation of any of the
Transactions. No such assignment shall release the assignor from any of its
obligations hereunder. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto or
their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights, remedies or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, other than (i) sections
which are specifically for the benefit of Seller Indemnified Parties or the
Buyer Indemnified Parties, (ii) _Section 3.19_ (No Other Representation and
Warranties), _Section 9.6_ (Indemnification of Offers and Directors), this
_Section 11.5_ and _Section 11.15_ (Representation by Counsel), each of
which is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby or to
be paid thereunder and may be enforced by such Persons and (iii) with regard
to _Section 11.6_ and _Section 11.17_, each of which is intended to be for
the benefit of each Lender, and its Affiliates and Representatives.

 



 

11.6 _Amendment or Modification_. This Agreement may not be amended except in
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Buyer Parent and Parent.
No amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be
binding unless executed in writing by (i) in the event that Buyer is to be
bound by the terms of such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver,
Buyer Parent or (ii) in the event that any Seller is to be bound by the terms
of such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver, Parent. ****
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment or waiver with respect to any
provision in _Section 7.2(b)_ (solely to the extent such amendment or waiver
relates to an increase on the aggregate liability of Buyer Indemnified
Parties), _Section 11.5_, this _Section 11.6_, or _Section 11.17_, to the
extent such amendment or waiver impacts the rights or remedies available to
each Lender, shall be valid or enforceable without the prior written consent
of the Lenders.

 



 

11.7 _Waiver_. Except where a specific period for action or inaction is
provided herein, neither the failure nor any delay on the part of any party
hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any waiver on the part of any party hereto of any such right, power or
privilege, nor any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or
privilege, preclude any

 



      
 

 



 

other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right,
power or privilege. The failure of a party hereto to exercise any right
conferred herein within the time required shall cause such right to terminate
with respect to the transaction or circumstances giving rise to such right,
but not to any such right arising as a result of any other transactions or
circumstances.

 



 

11.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, and subject to _Section 9.4(e)_, all other terms or other provisions
of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long
as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any
manner adverse to any party.

 



 

11.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement (and any claim or controversy arising out
of or relating to this Agreement) shall be governed by the laws of the State
of Delaware without regard to conflict of law principles that would result in
the application of any Law other than the laws of the State of Delaware.

 



 

11.10 _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 11.10_.

 



 

11.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware)
(the " _Applicable Delaware Court_ "), in any action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each party hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or
proceeding except in an Applicable Delaware Court; (ii) agrees that any claim
in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in an
Applicable Delaware Court; (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally
and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Applicable
Delaware Court; and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such Applicable

 



      
 

 



 

Delaware Court. Each party hereto agrees that (a) this Agreement involves at
least $100,000.00 and (b) this Agreement has been entered into by the parties
hereto in express reliance upon 6 Del. C. § 2708. Each party hereto agrees
that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law. Each party hereto irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in _Section 11.2_. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any
other manner permitted by Law.

 



 

11.12 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and
agrees that the other parties to this Agreement would be irreparably damaged
in the event that any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement are not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached.
Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the other parties to
this Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, and to enforce
specifically the performance by such first party under this Agreement, and
each party hereto hereby agrees to waive the defense in any such suit that the
other parties to this Agreement have an adequate remedy at law and to
interpose no opposition, legal or otherwise, as to the propriety of injunction
or specific performance as a remedy, and hereby agrees to waive any
requirement to post any bond in connection with obtaining such relief. The
equitable remedies described in this _Section 11.12_ shall be in addition to,
and not in lieu of, any other remedies at law or in equity that the parties
hereto may elect to pursue.

 



 

11.13 _Cumulative Remedies_. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this
Agreement, all rights and remedies of either party hereto are cumulative of
each other and of every other right or remedy such party may otherwise have at
law or in equity, and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies shall not
prejudice or impair the concurrent or subsequent exercise of other rights or
remedies.

 



 

11.14 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, whether or
not the Transactions are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses.

 



 

11.15 _Representation by Counsel_. Each party hereto represents and agrees
with each other that it has been represented by or had the opportunity to be
represented by, independent counsel of its own choosing, and that it has had
the full right and opportunity to consult with its respective attorney(s),
that to the extent, if any, that it desired, it availed itself of this right
and opportunity, that each is fully aware of the contents thereof and its
meaning, intent and legal effect, and that it or its authorized officer (as
the case may be) is competent to execute this Agreement and has executed this
Agreement free from coercion, duress or undue influence. Buyer agrees and
acknowledges that the law firm of Latham and Watkins LLP has represented and is
representing the Sellers with respect to the negotiation of this Agreement and
the Transactions, and Buyer irrevocably waives any conflict in connection
therewith, including with respect to any dispute, litigation or proceeding
that may arise out of or in connection with the Transactions or this
Agreement. Buyer, for itself and the Purchased Entities and for Buyers and
each Purchased Entitys respective successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably
waives and consents to any such representation in any such matter and the
communication by such counsel to the Sellers in connection with any such
representation of any fact known to such counsel arising by reason of

(d) _Missing Transition Services_. Seller agrees that, if any transition
service is identified after the Closing that is not contained in Exhibit A-1
but is necessary to allow Buyer to conduct the Businesses after the Closing in
substantially the same manner as such was conducted immediately prior to the
Closing (any such service a " _Missing Transition Service_ "), Seller shall
discuss with Buyer in good faith the provision of such Missing Transition
Service on terms and conditions to be mutually agreed upon by the Parties in
writing and the Parties shall amend this Agreement to provide for such Missing
Transition Service.

 



 

(e) _Level of Services_.

 



 

(i) The Providing Party shall provide the Transition Services at the same
location and in a manner reasonably similar to the manner in which such
Transition Services were provided immediately prior to the Closing. Unless
otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties in writing, with respect to any
Transition Service, the Providing Party shall not be required to provide a
level of service which is higher than (including as to volume, quantity,
level, complexity or frequency, as applicable) the level of service provided
by the Providing Party immediately prior to the Closing, or to make changes to
any Transition Service, including the location where the services are to be
provided; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Project Managers for a Transition
Service may mutually agree to any such increase or change in such Transition
Service, including any cost or fee adjustments associated with such increase
or change. Except as set forth in _Sections 13_ and _14_ of this Agreement, no
Providing Party shall be liable for any error or omission in rendering such
services, or any defect in the services rendered.

 



 

(ii) The Providing Partys obligation to provide the Transition Services with
respect to the Receiving Party in a manner reasonably similar to the manner in
which such Transition Services were provided immediately prior to the Closing
shall be subject to the Receiving Party ensuring that the physical and
technical environment and level of trained personnel at the facilities of the
Receiving Party during the Term of this Agreement are reasonably similar to
those which were present immediately prior to the Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, after written notice to the Providing
Party, the Receiving Party may make changes to the physical or technical
environment or level of trained personnel at the facilities of the Receiving
Party to the extent such changes do not, in the Providing Partys reasonable
determination, adversely impact the ability of the Providing Party to deliver
the Transition Services _._ In the event that the Providing Party reasonably
determines that its ability to deliver the Transition Services is adversely
impacted as a result of any such changes, then, upon written notice to the
Receiving Party, the Providing Party shall be entitled to charge the Receiving
Party for the Providing Partys costs attributable to remedy the effect of
such changes in accordance with _Section 5(c)(iii)_. If the Receiving Party
provides notice in accordance with _Section 5(c)(iii)_ that it does not wish
to incur such additional costs, the Providing Party may terminate the
provisions of this Agreement relating to such Transition Services (and any
Transition Services related thereto or dependent thereon).

 



 

(f) _Third Party Providers_. The Providing Party may, in its sole discretion,
arrange for a third party service provider to provide any of the Transition
Services; _provided_ , _however_ , that the applicable Providing Party will
use any and all reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that any such
Transition Services provided by such third party shall be provided in
substantially the same manner in which such Transition Services were provided
to or by the Businesses immediately prior to the Closing, and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the applicable Providing Party shall continue to be
responsible for the performance of any Transition Services provided by any
such third party. The Receiving Party may not request any change to or
increase in any Transition Service provided by a third party without
simultaneously providing a copy of such request to the Providing Party that
arranged for such third party to provide such Transition Service, and no such
change to or increase in such Transition Service may be made without the
arranging Providing Partys approval of such request.

 



 

(g) _Project Managers_. The Parties have each designated in the Exhibits
hereto, for each type of Transition Service provided, one of their employees
(or an employee of an Affiliate) as their respective " _Project Manager_ " for
the designated Transition Service. The Project Managers shall be the principal
point of contact for the Parties for all matters relating to such Transition
Services. Each Project Manager shall have appropriate decision-making
authority for its respective Party and shall be responsible for such Partys
monitoring of the status of the designated Transition Services. A Project
Manager may be replaced at any time and for any reason by the Party employing
the Project Manager and such replacement shall be effective upon written
notice to the other Party of such replacement.

 



 

(h) _Transition Services Managers_. Each Party has designated the employee of
such Party (or its Affiliate) set forth below its name on _Schedule 1_ hereto
as its " _Transition Services Manager_ " for this Agreement. Each Transition
Services Manager shall have appropriate decision-making authority from its
respective Party, and shall be responsible for such Partys general oversight
and monitoring of the activities contemplated by this Agreement, including
supervision of its respective Project Managers. Any disputes or disagreements
that are unresolved by any applicable Project Managers shall be escalated to
the Transition Services Managers for attempted resolution in the first
instance. A Party may replace its Transition Services Manager at any time and
for any reason, and such replacement shall be effective upon written notice to
the other Party of such replacement.

 



 

(i) _Cooperation; Reports_. Subject to _Section 9_, each Party shall cause
its employees and, as appropriate, its Affiliates and the employees of its
Affiliates, to cooperate in good faith and in a professional and workmanlike
manner with employees of the other Party or its Affiliates to the extent
necessary for the effective delivery of Transition Services. Upon request, the
Receiving Party shall promptly provide the Providing Party with data and
reports that are reasonably necessary for the

 



      
 

 



 

Providing Party to provide the Transition Services to the Receiving Party. All
such data provided shall be considered Proprietary Information (as defined in
_Section 7_ below) of the Receiving Party subject to the provisions of
_Section 7_ of this Agreement.

 



 

(j) _Receiving Affiliate_. Buyer and Seller shall each use its best efforts to
(i) cause each of its respective Receiving Affiliates at all times to promptly
comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, all payment, use restrictions and confidentiality obligations, and
to promptly and fully perform such Receiving Affiliates obligations
hereunder, in each case as if such Receiving Affiliate was a Party to this
Agreement, and (ii) not permit a default hereunder by or through any of its
respective Receiving Affiliates to occur or be continuing hereunder.

 



 

3. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts to Replace Transition Services_. The Parties acknowledge the transitional nature of the Transition Services. Accordingly, the Receiving Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to replace, and cease the use of, the Transition Services to be provided hereunder as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof so that the Transition Services are terminated by the end of their designated term pursuant to _Section 12_. If the Receiving Party does not replace and cease the use of the Transition Services provided to it, then the Providing Party shall have no obligation to continue to provide the Transition Services after the expiration of such Transition Services designated terms pursuant to _Section 12_; provided, however, that the Receiving Party may elect to extend the terms for such Transition Services by an additional three (3) months, subject to a fifteen percent (15%) increase in the amounts payable in respect of such Transition Services pursuant to _Section 5_ during such three (3) month period. Such election must be made in writing to the Providing Party not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the term for such Transition Services.

 



 

4. _Software and Licenses_. If the performance of a Transition Service requires licenses, consents, permits or approvals from third parties not obtained prior to the date of this Agreement, the Providing Party shall have no obligation to perform or arrange for the performance of such Transition Service until such license, consent, or approval is obtained. The Parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at no out-of-pocket cost to the Providing Party and at the Receiving Partys sole expense, any such required licenses, consents and approvals, and shall discuss the need for any modifications to the Transition Services necessary in order to permit the Transition Services to continue to be performed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement pending the receipt of such licenses, consents and approvals. In arranging for such licensing, the Providing Party will cooperate with the Receiving Partys efforts to reduce such licensing costs including, but not limited to, leveraging and utilizing existing agreements with such third party licensors or services providers. If obtaining any such required license, consent or approval will require the payment of consideration or the incurrence of additional out-of-pocket costs, the Receiving Party shall pay such consideration or costs and the Providing Party shall have no responsibility therefor. In addition, the Receiving Party shall be solely responsible for the cost of all licenses for intellectual property acquired from a third party required to be purchased by the Receiving Party in order to operate the Businesses, and the Providing Party shall have no responsibility therefor. These obligations shall be in addition to any obligations of the Seller contained in the Purchase Agreement to deliver software licenses, consents or approvals to Buyer, and to the extent such obligations are specified, such obligations shall be in addition to the obligations stated herein.

 



 

5. _Payments, Fees and Costs_.

 



 

(a) _Transition Services_. In consideration of the performance by the
Providing Party of its respective Transition Services, the respective
Receiving Party shall pay monthly, in accordance with _Section 5(e)_:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) to the Providing Party, in respect of each Transition Service so
performed, the amounts that are specified as payable to the Providing Party in
this Agreement (including the applicable Exhibit(s)); plus

 



 

(ii) to the Providing Party, subject to the prior written approval of the
Receiving Party, any and all reasonable travel, lodging, meals, mileage and
other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Providing Party, its consultants
or Representatives in connection with the provision of Transition Services,
except to the extent such expenses are already charged to the Receiving Party
through the fee (as indicated in the invoices from the Providing Party) or
otherwise previously paid by the Receiving Party as charges hereunder. The
Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that if it does not approve such
reasonable expenses in connection with the provision of Transition Services,
the Providing Party shall be able to terminate the provision of the relevant
Transition Services (and any Transition Services related thereto or dependent
thereon) upon ten (10) Business Days prior written notice; _provided that_
the Receiving Party shall have an opportunity to cure during such ten (10)
Business Day period.

 



 

(b) _Taxes_. The Receiving Party shall pay all applicable sales, use or other
Taxes incurred with respect to the sale, performance, provision or delivery of
Transition Services. Such Taxes shall be in addition to the other payments or
charges provided for in this Agreement. If the Providing Party pays or incurs
any Tax in respect of the performance, provision or delivery of any Transition
Service, the Providing Party may include such amount in an invoice to the
Receiving Party (but without duplication to the extent any other Receiving
Party has already paid such expenses through charges hereunder) in respect of
such Transition Service.

 



 

(c) _Incremental Costs_.

 



 

(i) If there is an increase in the fees and costs imposed by third parties for
materials the Providing Party reasonably uses or plans to use in providing the
Transition Services, the fees payable by the Receiving Party hereunder shall
be increased proportionately to reflect such increase in third party fees and
costs. Any such increase will be incorporated into the Transition Service
Expenses (as defined in Section 5(e)(i) below) and invoiced and paid pursuant
to _Section 5(e)_. The Providing Party will use reasonable commercial efforts
to avoid any increases in fees and costs, and will provide prompt written
notice of any potential increases to the Receiving Party.

 



 

(ii) If there is an increase or change in the volume or quantity of any
Transition Services pursuant to _Section 2(e)(i)_, the fees and costs
associated with such increase or change, if any, shall be payable by the
Receiving Party. Any such increase will be incorporated into the Transition
Service Expenses (as defined in Section 5(e)(i) below) and invoiced and paid
pursuant to _Section 5(e)_. The Providing Party will use reasonable
commercial efforts to avoid any increases in fees and costs, and will provide
prompt written notice of any potential increases to the Receiving Party.

 



 

(iii) In addition, in the event that the Providing Party reasonably
anticipates that it will incur direct or indirect costs (including time spent
on the provision of Transition Services) as a result of (A) modifications to
the systems or processes that the Providing Party uses or plans to use to
provide the Transition Services, or (B) changes to the physical or technical
environment or level of trained personnel at the relevant facilities of the
Receiving Party, in each case occurring as the result of any act or failure to
act of the Receiving Party, the Providing Party shall provide the Receiving
Party with written notice (the " _Incremental Cost Notice_ ") of the nature
and amount of any such incremental costs and the Transition Services

 



      
 

 



 

to which they relate as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event less than
ten (10) Business Days prior to incurring such costs; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the case of a change described in clause (B) above, such notice shall
only be required if the Receiving Party has complied with the requirements of
_Section 2(e)(iii)_ in respect of such change. The Receiving Party shall
respond by written notice to the Providing Party within ten (10) Business Days
after receiving the Incremental Cost Notice if the Receiving Party determines
that it does not wish to incur such costs, in which case, unless the Parties
otherwise agree, the Providing Party may terminate the provision of the
Transition Service(s) to which the incremental costs relate (and any other
Transition Services related thereto or dependent thereon) on ten (10) Business
Days prior written notice to the Providing Party. If the Receiving Party does
not provide such notice to the Providing Party within such ten (10) Business
Day period or if the Receiving Party has not complied with the requirements of
_Section 2(e)(iii)_ before making a change described in clause (B) above,
then the Providing Party shall be entitled to incur the costs specified in the
Incremental Cost Notice and invoice the Receiving Party for the same in
accordance with _Section 5(e)_.

 



 

(d) _Other Incidental Transition Costs_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Receiving Party shall bear any additional costs resulting
from: (i) the retention of any consultants approved by the Receiving Party and
necessary for the migration of any software or other applications to an
existing or new platform, or any improvement or modification to such
applications made to accommodate the Receiving Party, _provided_ that any such
improvements or modifications shall be owned by the Receiving Party and
_provided_ _further_ that the Receiving Party shall have previously consented
in writing to the terms of retention of any such consultant; (ii) the decision
by the Receiving Party to outsource any of its management information system
functions to third party application service providers; and (iii) any
requirement for additional disk space or increased processing capability in
excess of that utilized by or on behalf of the Receiving Party as of the
Closing.

 



 

(e) _Invoicing and Payments_.

 



 

(i) The Providing Party shall invoice the Receiving Party as follows for
Transition Services fees, costs, expenses, liabilities, Losses, and other
amounts paid, owed, or required to be paid by the Receiving Party under this
Agreement (collectively the " _Transition Service Expenses_ "): an invoice
shall be rendered on or before the 15th day of the month that immediately
follows the month in which the applicable Transition Services are to be
provided, setting forth in reasonable detail the Transition Service Expenses
to be paid, subject to the provisions of Section 5(a) of this Agreement;
provided, however, that if the Receiving Party elects to extend the Term
pursuant to Section 12(b), the fees for all Transition Services shall be equal
to 115% of the applicable fees for such Transition Services set forth in the
attached Exhibits.

 



 

(ii) The Receiving Party shall pay all such invoices no later than thirty (30)
days after receipt of such invoice. For the avoidance of doubt, any Transition
Service Expenses invoiced to Buyer or Seller hereunder shall be deemed
invoiced to and received by their respective Receiving Parties.

 



 

(iii) Outstanding amounts not paid in full in accordance with this _Section
5_ shall bear interest from the date such payment was due under this Agreement
at the rate of the lesser of 0.75% per month or the highest amount permitted
to be charged under applicable Law. Any collection of interest with respect to
overdue payments shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, the
remedies at law or equity or otherwise available to the Party to whom such
payment is owed.

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) For avoidance of doubt, the Transition Service Expenses shall not include
any of the Receiving Partys accounts payable or be net of any of the
Receiving Partys accounts receivable, that in either case the Providing Party
may process on behalf of the Receiving Party pursuant to a provided Transition
Service. For clarity:

 



 

(1) If, pursuant to the provision of a Transition Service, the Providing Party
processes any accounts payable on behalf of the Receiving Party, the Providing
Party shall provide the Receiving Party with the invoice(s) for such accounts
payable, and the Receiving Party (x) shall verify the amount(s) stated on such
invoice(s), and (y) transfer such amount(s) to the Providing Party by wire
transfer of immediately available funds or electronic transmission of
immediately available funds, in each case within a commercially reasonable
period following receipt of such invoice(s).

 



 

(2) If, pursuant to the provision of a Transition Service, the Providing Party
receives payment of any accounts receivable on behalf of the Receiving Party,
the Providing Party shall (x) advise the Receiving Party of its receipt of
such amount(s), and (y) transfer such amount(s) to the Receiving Party by wire
transfer of immediately available funds or electronic transmission of
immediately available funds, in each case within a commercially reasonable
period following receipt of such amount(s).

 



 

(f) _Payments to be Electronically Transmitted; Currency_. All payments
required to be made by the Receiving Party hereunder shall be made by
electronic transmission of immediately available funds within the required
time to one or more accounts specified by the Providing Party. The Receiving
Party agrees to pay each invoice in United States dollars.

 



 

(g) _Prior Notice_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Providing Party shall provide the Receiving Party with prior written notice of
any additional fees or costs not listed in the attached Exhibits that it may
incur in connection with the provision of the Transition Services hereunder.

 



 

(h) _Invoice Dispute Resolution Procedure_.

 



 

(i) In the event that the Receiving Party believes that an invoice amount is
incorrect, the Receiving Party must notify the Providing Party in writing (the
" _Dispute Notice_ ") on or before the later of (A) ten (10) Business Days
after the Receiving Partys receipt of the disputed invoice and (B) the date
on which the disputed invoice is due. The Dispute Notice must set forth in
reasonable detail the basis for the dispute and the amount in dispute (the "
_Disputed Amount_ "). If the Receiving Party does not deliver a Dispute Notice
within the time period set forth in the first sentence of this _Section
5(h)(i)_, then the invoice shall be deemed to be correct in all respects
(subject to the Receiving Partys rights under _Section 5(i)(ii)_). The
Receiving Party shall be permitted to submit only one Dispute Notice per
invoice, and shall timely pay any undisputed portion of such invoice in the
manner set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) The Parties shall in good faith use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve their dispute over the Disputed Amount pursuant to this _Section
5(h)_ as soon as reasonably possible after delivery of a Dispute Notice.
Notwithstanding any such dispute resolution efforts, if the Disputed Amount is
not paid to the Providing Party or otherwise resolved within thirty (30) days
after the date originally due under _Section 5(e)(ii)_, the Providing Party
may, upon at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice, suspend the
provision of such Transition Service(s) (and any Transition Services related
thereto or dependent thereon) until

 



      
 

 



 

payment by the Receiving Party or any of its Affiliates of such Disputed
Amount(s) or other mutually-agreed resolution; _provided_ , _however_ , that:

 



 

(1) the Providing Party will resume the provision of such suspended Transition
Services upon the payment of the Disputed Amount(s), and

 



 

(2) upon the Parties written agreement on the proper resolution of the
dispute specified by the Dispute Notice and the correct amount due to the
Providing Party, the Receiving Party shall promptly pay such amount or, if the
Disputed Amount was previously paid to the Providing Party and the correct
amount is less than the Disputed Amount, the Providing Party shall apply the
difference between the correct amount and the Disputed Amount towards the next
invoice.

 



 

(iii) If the aggregate Disputed Amounts exceed $500,000, the Providing Party
may immediately suspend the provision of all of its Transition Services
hereunder until the earlier of (A) resolution of the disputes and payment by
the Receiving Party or any of its Affiliates of all Disputed Amounts agreed by
the Parties, and (B) the payment by the Receiving Party or any of its
Affiliates of an amount equal to the portion of the Disputed Amount in excess
of $500,000.

 



 

(i) _Records and Audits_.

 



 

(i) _Records._ The Providing Party will maintain (and, as applicable, cause
its Affiliates and use commercially reasonable efforts (but no lesser efforts
than it used immediately prior to the Closing) to cause its independent
contractors to maintain) accurate and complete records regarding its
activities relating to this Agreement and the means of calculating the amounts
billed to the Receiving Party hereunder. Such books and records will, at all
times, be kept in a manner consistent with the Providing Partys past
practices prior to the Closing and, in any event, in accordance with good
administrative and secretarial practice and generally accepted accounting
principles. The Providing Party will retain (and, as applicable, cause its
Affiliates to retain) all such records until two (2) years after any
termination or expiration of this Agreement, unless otherwise directed by the
Receiving Party.

 



 

(ii) _Audits._ Upon fifteen (15) Business Days notice to the Providing Party,
the Receiving Party and its designees will have the right to inspect and audit
all the relevant records and books of account of the Providing Party and its
Affiliates to verify the accuracy of all payments made or to be made by the
Receiving Party pursuant to _Section 5_. Any audit by the Receiving Party or
its designees will be conducted during regular business hours at the
facilities of the Providing Party or its Affiliates, and in a manner that does
not unreasonably interfere with the normal business activities of the
Providing Party or its Affiliates. If any audit reveals an overpayment by the
Receiving Party, the Providing Party will promptly refund any overpayment. In
addition, if any audit reveals an overpayment by the Receiving Party exceeding
ten percent (10%) during the audited period, the Providing Party will
reimburse the Receiving Party for the costs of conducting the audit. For
avoidance of doubt, the audit rights of this _Section _ _5(i)(ii)_ are
solely to verify the arithmetic computation of invoiced amounts and for no
other purpose. When visiting the Providing Partys facilities pursuant to this
_Section 5(i)(ii)_, the Receiving Party and its designees shall comply with
the Providing Partys (a) safety, security and other rules applicable to those
working at the Providing Partys facilities and (b) policies concerning access
to and security of any premises or computer system to which such Person may
have access, in each case, to the extent made known by or as would be
reasonably evident to such Person.

 



   

     
 

 



 

6. _Access; Information Technology_.

 



 

(a) The Receiving Party acknowledges that certain of the Transition Services
include access to certain computer networks of the Providing Party (the "
_Providing Party Computer Network_ "), and that such access is conditioned
upon the Receiving Partys agreement to the terms set forth in _Schedule 2_
hereto. The Providing Party shall use reasonable commercial efforts to create
and maintain the Receiving Partys access to the Providing Party Computer
Network for as long as such access is required to receive and use the
Transition Services. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the provision of
the Transition Services hereunder may be subject to (i) the installation,
configuration, or re-configuration of a firewall and/or one or more network
security devices at each of the sites operated by the Receiving Party to
protect the Providing Party Computer Network, and (ii) the Providing Party
installing, configuring, and re-configuring such firewall or network security
device and managing and maintaining the resulting network configuration. The
Receiving Party agrees that such installation, configuration and/or re-
configuration shall be carried out in accordance with and shall comply with
all of the Providing Partys written requirements and guidelines provided such
requirements and guidelines are commercially reasonable and necessary to
protect the Providing Party Computer Network and are provided to the Receiving
Party in advance. All reasonable costs of installation of such firewalls and
network security devices, and all reasonable ongoing costs and expenses of
maintaining the firewalls and other network security devices shall be borne by
the Receiving Party provided that the Providing Party shall not charge for
accessing or utilizing the Providing Party Computer Network and shall
otherwise only charge the Receiving Party for any actual expense incurred by
the Providing Party for third party materials purchased by the Providing Party
solely for the benefit of the Receiving Party in accessing the Providing Party
Computer Network.

 



 

(b) _Right to Terminate_. The Providing Party reserves the right to terminate
those Transition Services relating to the Providing Party Computer Network
(and any Transition Service related thereto or dependent thereon) and to
terminate the Receiving Partys access to the Providing Party Computer Network
(and any Transition Service related thereto or dependent thereon) in the event
the Receiving Party fails to cure any material breach of this _Section 6_
(including the terms set forth in _Schedule 2_ hereto) within ten (10)
Business Days after written notification to the Receiving Party of such
material breach; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Providing Party may
temporarily suspend the Receiving Partys access to the Providing Party
Computer Network without such notice in the event such material breach
damages, injures or poses an imminent risk to the integrity or operations of
the Providing Party Computer Network. The Providing Party **** shall be under
no obligation to reinstate either the Receiving Partys Transition Services
related to the Providing Party Computer Network or the Receiving Partys
access to the Providing Party Computer Network following any such material
breach and failure to cure until such material breach has been cured in a
manner reasonably expected to prevent a recurrence of such material breach.

 



 

7. _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Each Party agrees and acknowledges that, during the Term of this
Agreement, the other Party hereto may have access to, or a Party (the "
_Discloser_ ") may be required to disclose to the other Party (the "
_Recipient_ "), certain confidential information, data, records, files,
archives and other proprietary information, whether oral or written,
concerning, among other things, third party materials or the Disclosers
inventions, know-how, customer lists, supplier lists, pricing, patent and
trade secrets, software, distribution and other general business information
(collectively, the " _Proprietary Information_ "). Each Party further agrees
and acknowledges that all Proprietary Information of the Discloser or its
Affiliates, customers, suppliers or independent contractors generated,
produced or stored by a Party or any third party in connection with the
provision of Transition Services or the performance of this Agreement shall be
the Proprietary Information of the Discloser, and that all information
relating to

 



      
 

 



 

the same and other information related to the historical and current
operations of the Discloser is the Proprietary Information of the Discloser.
Proprietary Information shall remain the sole property of the Discloser and
the other Party shall have no interest in or rights with respect to such
Proprietary Information.

 



 

(b) _Protection_. During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of three
(3) years after the termination or expiration hereof, and, in respect of
Proprietary Information that constitutes computer source code, for an
indefinite period, each Party agrees, and shall cause its respective
Affiliates, service providers, independent contractors and Representatives, to
protect the confidentiality of the other Partys Proprietary Information with
the same degree of care that it utilizes with respect to its own similar
confidential and proprietary information, but in any event, no less than
reasonable care, including:

 



 

(i) not to disclose or copy, display, loan, publish, transfer (whether by
sale, operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise disseminate or allow access
to the Proprietary Information, in whole or in part, in any form whatsoever,
to or by any third party without the prior written consent of the Discloser,
except that such disclosure or access shall be permitted with respect to an
employee or independent contractor of Recipient requiring access to the
Proprietary Information in the course of his or her employment or provision of
Transition Services hereunder, _provided_ , _however_ , that such employee or
independent contractor is subject to confidentiality obligations substantially
similar and in no event less restrictive than as set forth in this Section 7;

 



 

(ii) to notify the Discloser promptly and in writing of the circumstances
surrounding any suspected possession, use, disclosure or knowledge of the
Proprietary Information or any part thereof at any location or by any person
or entity other than those authorized by this Agreement and to take further
steps as may reasonably be requested by the Discloser to remedy any such
possession, use or disclosure; and

 



 

(iii) upon the Disclosers request, to promptly return to Discloser or destroy
all documents and materials in tangible form, and permanently erase all data
in electronic form, containing any Proprietary Information, and certify in
writing signed by an officer of Recipient that Recipient has fully complied
with this obligation (except that the Recipients legal counsel may retain one
copy of such information in their offices for record-keeping purposes only).

 



 

(c) _Use_. A Party shall not use, nor permit the use of, a Disclosers
Proprietary Information for any purpose other than in connection with the
performance of its obligations hereunder or as otherwise expressly permitted
herein.

 



 

(d) _Exceptions_. Nothing in this _Section 7_ shall restrict the Parties with
respect to confidential information, data, records, files, archives or other
proprietary information, whether or not identical or similar to that contained
in the Proprietary Information, if such confidential information, data,
records, files, archives or other proprietary information: (i) is
independently developed by the Recipient without reference to the Disclosers
Proprietary Information (and Recipient shall provide the Discloser with
reasonably satisfactory evidence of such independent development); (ii) is or
becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of any act or
default of, or disclosure by, the Recipient; (iii) becomes available to the
Recipient on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Discloser
or its Affiliates, Representatives or independent contractors, _provided_ such
source is entitled to disclose such information to the Recipient on a non-
confidential basis; (iv) was known by the Recipient on a non-confidential
basis prior to the disclosure thereof to the Recipient by the Discloser; or
(v) is

 



      
 

 



 

required by Law to be disclosed; _provided_ , _however_ , that as soon as is
reasonably practicable after receiving notice of any such required disclosure
and to the extent that it may legally do so, the Recipient advises the
Discloser of the same, and prior to making any such disclosure, takes
commercially reasonable actions to assure the confidential handling of the
Proprietary Information, including, to the extent permissible and practicable,
affording the Discloser a reasonable period of time to seek a protective order
prohibiting the disclosure of the Proprietary Information, if allowed by
applicable Law and cooperates with the Discloser, at the Disclosers
reasonable request and expense, in any lawful action to contest or limit the
scope of such required disclosure.

 



 

(e) _Injunctive Relief_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other
Party may suffer irreparable harm for which monetary damages may be an
inadequate remedy if there were a breach by such Party of obligations under
this _Section 7_. Each Party further acknowledges and agrees that equitable
relief, including injunctive relief, may be appropriate to protect the non-
breaching Partys rights and interests if such a breach were to arise, be
threatened, or be asserted, and the non-breaching Party will be entitled to
seek the entry of an order for immediate injunctive relief.

 



 

(f) _Trade Secrets_. The Parties agree that notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, neither Party shall disclose to the other Party
any of its trade secrets or have any rights in or to any of the other Partys
trade secrets. To the extent a Providing Party determines that it is necessary
to disclose any trade secrets to the Receiving Party in order for the
Providing Party to perform or the Receiving Party to receive any Transition
Services (such Transition Services, the " _Dependent Transition Services_ ")
as set forth in this Agreement, the Parties shall mutually agree in writing on
the reasonable terms and conditions of such disclosure and the Receiving
Partys obligations with respect to such trade secrets. Until the Parties are
able to mutually agree on such reasonable terms and conditions, the Providing
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Dependent
Transition Services without disclosing such trade secrets, but shall not be
liable for any failure by it to perform or any failure by the Receiving Party
to receive the Dependent Transition Services in accordance with this Agreement
(or Losses that result therefrom) that results from the non-disclosure of such
trade secrets.

 



 

8. _Compliance With Third Party Agreements_. In the event that Buyer or Seller or any of its respective Affiliates arranges for a Transition Service to be provided to the Receiving Party by an Affiliate or a third party service provider, the Receiving Party shall at all times comply with the material terms of the Providing Partys (or any of its Affiliates) agreements with such Affiliate or third party service provider (each, a " _Third Party Agreement_ "), to the extent such Third Party Agreements are applicable to the Transition Services, as if the Receiving Party was party thereto, including without limitation all use restrictions and confidentiality obligations; _provided_ _that_ the Receiving Party shall be provided with a reasonably detailed summary of all material terms of such Third Party Agreement with which such Receiving Party is required to comply. In the event that the Receiving Party fails to meet its obligations under the preceding sentence of this _Section 8_ as to the terms of a Third Party Agreement, the Providing Party may provide the Receiving Party with written notice of its intention to terminate all Transition Services that are provided to the Receiving Party under such Third Party Agreement. In the event that such Third Party Agreement provides for a cure period and the Receiving Party does not cure its or any of its applicable Affiliates failure to meet its obligations under such Third Party Agreement within the cure period provided for in such Third Party Agreement, the Providing Party shall be entitled to terminate all Transition Services that are provided to the Receiving Party under such Third Party Agreement, and any Transition Services related thereto or dependent thereon.

 



 

9. _Disclaimer of Warranties_. EXCEPT FOR ANY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT ARE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, THE TRANSITION SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO EACH RECEIVING PARTY "AS-IS." NEITHER BUYER NOR SELLER, NOR

 



      
 

 



 

ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING THE TRANSITION
SERVICES IT PROVIDES. THE PROVIDING PARTY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS THE
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ANY AND
ALL WARRANTIES AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW.

 



 

10. _Access to Facilities to Provide Services and Remove Equipment_. In connection with the provision of Transition Services, the Receiving Party shall permit, and shall cause its Affiliates to permit, the Providing Party, and their respective employees, vendors and independent contractors, to have reasonable access to the facilities of the Receiving Party to the extent required to provide the Transition Services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In further connection with the provision of the Transition Services, Receiving Party shall permit, and shall cause its Affiliates to permit, Seller, its Affiliates and any service providers, and their respective employees, vendors and independent contractors, to remove the property of Providing Party, its Affiliates and any service providers from Receiving Partys facilities. When visiting the Receiving Partys facilities pursuant to this Agreement, the Providing Party shall cause its respective employees, vendors and independent contractors to comply with the Receiving Partys (a) safety, security and other rules applicable to those working at the Receiving Partys facilities and (b) policies concerning access to and security of any premises or computer system to which such Person may have access, in each case, to the extent made known by or as would be reasonably evident to such employee, vendor or independent contractor.

 



 

11. _Insurance_. Each Party shall, to the extent commercially reasonable, maintain insurance covering all risks for which insurance applicable to the Transition Services is customarily maintained for businesses similar to the businesses of each Party, including, without limitation, all risks to and from the property and employees of such Party and its Affiliates.

 



 

12. _Term; Termination_.

 



 

(a) Unless terminated earlier or extended in accordance with this _Section
12_, the term of this Agreement (the " _Term_ ") shall commence as of the
Closing Date and shall expire twelve (12) months after the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if an earlier termination date for a
Transition Service is set forth in an Exhibit or another Section of this
Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement with respect to such Transition
Service shall terminate on such earlier termination date, and (ii) this
Agreement is not otherwise earlier terminated pursuant to its terms.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Sections 3 and 5(e)_ , the Receiving Party may elect to extend
the term of any Transition Services or the Term of this Agreement by an
additional three (3) months, subject to a fifteen percent (15%) increase in
the amounts payable in respect of such Transition Services pursuant to Section
5 during such three (3) month period. Such election must be made in writing to
the Providing Party not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of
the term for such Transition Services or the Term of this Agreement, as
applicable.

 



 

(c) This Agreement, or specific Transition Services provided hereunder, may be
terminated before the completion of the Term:

 



 

(i) by mutual agreement of the Parties;

 



 

(ii) by the Providing Party as expressly set forth in this Agreement;

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) by the Providing Party, on the one hand, or the Receiving Party, on the
other hand, for material breach by the other of any of the terms hereof if
such material breach is not cured within forty-five (45) days after written
notice of such breach is delivered to the breaching Party (and if the
Providing Party is an Affiliate of Seller or service provider of Seller, such
written notice will be delivered to Seller by the applicable Buyer Receiving
Party);

 



 

(iv) by the Providing Party, on the one hand, or the Receiving Party, on the
other hand, in the event of the filing by or against the other Party of a
petition in bankruptcy, or the appointment of a receiver of such other Party
or any substantial portion of such other Partys assets, or any proceeding or
reorganization for the benefit of the other Partys creditors, or upon the
other Party becoming insolvent; or

 



 

(v) with respect to any or all Transition Service(s) and except as may
otherwise be noted in the attached Exhibits, by the Receiving Party for any
reason in its sole and absolute discretion. Such termination will be effective
upon the later of (i) thirty (30) days after written notice of such
termination is received by the Providing Party, or (ii) if such written notice
is given later than the first day of any calendar month, the end of the second
full calendar month after such notice is given (for illustrative purposes
only, a termination notice delivered under this Section 12(c)(v) on June 15,
2013, shall be effective on August 31, 2013).

 



 

(d) Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or particular Transition
Services hereunder, the Providing Party shall have no further obligation
hereunder to provide such particular Transition Services (and any Transition
Services related thereto or dependent thereon); _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no obligation of a
Party accruing hereunder prior to such expiration or termination shall be
terminated or otherwise relieved and the rights and obligations of the Parties
under _Sections 5_ (except for the audit rights under _Section 5(i)(ii)_,
which shall only survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for
six (6) months), _7_ , _9_ , _10_ (but solely with respect to the removal of
property), _11_ , _12_ , _13_ , _14_ , _15_ , _16_ and _17_ and all of the
Receiving Partys payment obligations with respect to any accrued but unpaid
amounts owed hereunder subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
shall survive any expiration or termination hereof.

 



 

(e) In addition, in the event that the Providing Party terminates this
Agreement or any of the Transition Services provided hereunder as set forth in
clauses _(c)(ii)_ , _(c)(iii)_ , or _(c)(iv)_ of this _Section 12_, or if
the Receiving Party terminates this Agreement or any of the Transition
Services provided hereunder as set forth in _(c)(v)_ of this _Section 12_,
then the Receiving Party shall pay any and all costs, expenses, penalties,
interest and the like imposed on or incurred by the Providing Party by third
parties in connection with such termination.

 



 

(f) (i) The Parties acknowledge and agree that certain Transition Services are
reliant on other Transition Services, such that the extension, suspension,
termination or expiration of one such Transition Service (any such event, a "
_Trigger Event_ ") would affect a Providing Partys ability to provide the
related Transition Services. Each group of related Transition Services is
identified on the Exhibits attached hereto by a particular "bucket".
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and unless the
Parties otherwise mutually agree in writing after evaluating the totality of
the Transition Services included in a particular bucket at the time of a
Trigger Event, no Trigger Event may occur with respect to a particular
Transition Service as provided herein, unless such Trigger Event also
concurrently applies to all other Transition Services included in the same
bucket (the " _Triggered Transition Services_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) If the Parties mutually agree in writing that the effect of a Trigger
Event described in _Section 12(f)(i)_ on the Triggered Transition Services
can be limited to one or more specific regions, countries, or locations, then
the Parties may mutually agree in writing to limit the effect of such Trigger
Event on the Triggered Transition Services to such specific regions,
countries, or locations.

 



 

(iii) If (A) the Parties mutually agree in writing that the effect of a
Trigger Event described in Section 12(f)(i) on the Triggered Transition
Services can be limited to some but not all of the Transition Services
included in the same bucket, or (B) the Receiving Party elects (pursuant to
Section 12(b) or otherwise), or the Parties otherwise agree, to continue any
Transition Services beyond the Term, so long as at least one Transition
Service from such bucket is provided, the Receiving Party will continue to pay
the full costs for all Transition Services in that same bucket.

 



 

13. _Limitation of Liability_.

 



 

(a) NEITHER THE PROVIDING PARTY, ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES ON
THE ONE HAND, NOR THE RECEIVING PARTY, ITS AFFILIATES, OR THEIR
REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE OTHER HAND, SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR
FOR ANY INDIRECT, COMPENSATORY, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY PERFORMANCE OF THE TRANSITION
SERVICES HEREUNDER OR THE PERFORMANCE OR BREACH OF ANY OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER
OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE APPLICABLE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 



 

(b) IN NO EVENT SHALL THE PROVIDING PARTY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE FOR
ANY DIRECT DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PERFORMANCE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY BREACH OF ANY OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, OR OTHERWISE THAT EXCEED THE SUM OF
THE AMOUNT PAID AND THE AMOUNT PAYABLE FOR THE TRANSITION SERVICES UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT. THE RECEIVING PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE CHARGES FOR THE
TRANSITION SERVICES IT RECEIVES AND THE RESOURCES PROVIDED HEREUNDER HAVE BEEN
ESTABLISHED IN CONTEMPLATION OF THE FOREGOING ALLOCATION OF RISK.

 



 

(c) THE WAIVER OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES AND THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET
FORTH IN CLAUSES (a) AND (b) ABOVE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDE ALL LIABILITY ARISING
FROM (1) BREACHES OF THE NON-USE AND NON-DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS OF _SECTION
7_ ABOVE, OR (2) A PARTYS FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

 



 

14. _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) _Indemnification by the Receiving Party_. The Receiving Party shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Providing Party, and its
Representatives, successors and assigns (the " _Providing Party Indemnitees_
"), from and against and in respect of any and all Losses, which the Providing
Party Indemnitees suffer as a result of third party claims relating to or
arising out of: (i) the performance by the Providing Party of any Transition
Services pursuant to this Agreement, other than to the extent such Losses are
the result of (A) the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Providing Party or its Representatives or independent contractor in the
performance of, or failure to perform under, this Agreement, or (B) a material
breach of this Agreement by the Providing Party or its Affiliates,
Representatives or independent contractors; (ii) any material breach of this
Agreement by the

 



      
 

 



 

Receiving Party or its Affiliates, Representatives or independent contractors,
it being acknowledged and agreed that the failure to pay any amounts due
hereunder within the time required hereunder for such payment shall be deemed
to be a material breach; or (iii) fraud, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Receiving Party or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

(b) _Indemnification by the Providing Party_. The Providing Party shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Receiving Party, and its respective
Representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Receiving Party
Indemnitees_ "), from and against and in respect of any and all Losses, which
the Receiving Party Indemnitees suffer as a result of third party claims
relating to or arising out of: (i) fraud, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Providing Party in the performance of, or failure to perform
under, this Agreement; or (ii) any material breach of this Agreement by the
Providing Party or its Affiliates, Representatives or independent contractors.
Except as provided in the first sentence of this _Section 14(b) above_, the
Providing Party shall have no liability whatsoever to any Receiving Party
Indemnitees for any error, act or omission in connection with the Transition
Services to be rendered hereunder, and the Providing Partys sole
responsibility to the Receiving Party Indemnitees with respect to any error,
act or omission in connection with the Transition Services shall be as
follows: (A) in the event of the Providing Partys error or omission in
connection with the Transition Services, to furnish correct information and to
provide any necessary adjustment in the Transition Services at no additional
cost or expense to the Receiving Party or its Affiliates; and (B) in the event
of the Providing Partys failure to deliver any Transition Service because of
a force majeure, to use reasonable efforts to make the Transition Services
available and/or to resume performing the Transition Services as promptly as
reasonably practicable.

 



 

(c) _Indemnification Process_. The Party seeking indemnification under this
_Section 14_ (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall provide prompt written
notice of such claim to other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), describing
the claim, the amount thereof (if known) and the alleged basis thereof. For
the avoidance of doubt, the failure of the Indemnified Party to provide such
notice shall not affect the indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying
Party, unless and to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced
by such failure. Subject to the remaining provisions of this _Section 14(c)_,
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense
and/or settlement of any such claim. The Indemnifying Party acknowledges and
agrees that the Indemnified Party has the right to participate, at its own
expense, in the defense of any claim for which the Indemnified Party is
seeking indemnification under this _Section 14_. The Indemnifying Party may
not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any such
claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, unless such
settlement, compromise or consent: (i) includes an unconditional release of
the Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such commenced or
threatened claim; and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission
of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of, the Indemnified
Party.

 



 

(d) _Indemnification Payment_. Any indemnification payment pursuant to this
_Section 14_ shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available
funds from the Indemnifying Party to an account designated by each applicable
Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days after the determination thereof.

 



 

(e) _General_. No right of indemnification shall exist under this Agreement
with respect to matters for which indemnification may reasonably be claimed
under the Purchase Agreement, it being the intent of the Parties that claims
that are addressed under the Purchase Agreement shall be governed solely by
the Purchase Agreement. No right of indemnification shall exist under the
Purchase Agreement for claims arising out of the performance of this
Agreement, it being the intent of the Parties that such claims shall be solely
governed by the provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no claim for indemnification made under this Agreement shall be denied solely
based on

 



      
 

 



 

the preceding two sentences if such claim was initially brought under the
Purchase Agreement and denied because the subject matter of such claim was
reasonably believed to be covered under the indemnification provisions of this
Agreement.

 



 

15. _Force Majeure_. Neither Party shall have any liability for Losses under this Agreement relating to, arising from or in connection with a delay in performance or a failure to perform caused by force majeure, that is due to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the Party affected thereby, including, without limitation, acts of God, acts of civil or military authority, fires, floods, inclement weather, epidemics, accidents, quarantine restrictions, war, terrorist acts, riots, demonstrations, strikes, lock-outs, labor disputes, labor shortages, sabotage, disruption of Internet access or the Providing Party Computer Network beyond the reasonable control of the Party providing such performance, whether as a result of any virus, worm, Trojan Horse, malware or other malicious or unauthorized code, accidents with respect to machinery or equipment, governmental action or inaction, order or restraints of governmental or other competent authorities, unavoidable delay in obtaining necessary materials, facilities or equipment in the open market caused by third parties, and delays in transportation caused by third parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Party affected by such force majeure event uses diligent efforts, under the circumstances, to notify the other Party in writing of the circumstances causing the delay or non-performance and resumes performance as soon as reasonably possible, and _provided_ _further_ that the other Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement on 30 days prior written notice to the affected Party if the force majeure event continues unabated for a period of 90 days.

17. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

(a) _Further Assurances_. If any further action is necessary, proper or
desirable to carry out any purpose of this Agreement, then each Party hereto
will take such further action (including the execution and delivery of further
documents) as the other Party hereto reasonably requests to carry out such
purpose. The foregoing will be at the expense of such requesting Party, except
to the extent such requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefor or
to the extent this Agreement otherwise allocates such expense to any other
Party.

 



 

(b) _No Solicitation; No Hire_. During the Term of this Agreement and for a
period of one (1) year thereafter, neither Party shall solicit, offer
employment to or hire any employee of the other Party or its Affiliates who
has or had been involved in the provision of Transition Services or
performance of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Party
shall be prohibited from (i) initiating searches for employees through the use
of general advertisement or through the engagement of firms to conduct
searches that are not targeted or focused on the employees of the other Party
(and the hiring of employees that respond to any such searches) or (ii) hiring
any such employee not employed by the other Party at the time of solicitation.

 



 

(c) _Independent Contractor Status_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be deemed to constitute a single employer, joint employer, co-employer, alter-
ego, agency, partnership, joint venture or similar relationship between the
Providing Party or any of the Providing Partys Affiliates, on the one hand,
and the Receiving Party or any of the Receiving Partys Affiliates, on the
other hand. Each Providing Party is acting pursuant to this Agreement solely
as an independent contractor.

 



 

(d) _No Right of Set-off_. All payments to be made by any Party under this
Agreement shall be made free of any set-off and shall be promptly remitted to
the Party entitled to receive payments hereunder.

 



 

(e) _No Implied Assignments or Licenses_. Nothing in this Agreement is to be
construed as an assignment or grant of any right, title or interest in any
Intellectual Property.

 



 

(f) _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise, by either Party without the prior
written consent of the other Party, and any such assignment without such prior
written consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
assignment shall limit the assignors obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns.

 



       
 

 



 

(g) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as expressly provided in _Sections 2_
, _8_ , and _14_ , nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies or liabilities under or
by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

(h) _Limitation on Actions_. Any action, claim, suit, litigation or other
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement must be commenced
within one (1) year after the earlier of (i) the expiration of the Term
including any extensions thereof, or (ii) the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(i) _No Waiver by Conduct; Waiver_. Except where a specific period for action
or inaction is provided herein, neither the failure nor any delay on the part
of any Party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege under this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part
of any Party hereto of any such right, power or privilege, nor any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or
privilege. The failure of a Party hereto to exercise any right conferred
herein within the time required shall cause such right to terminate with
respect to the transaction or circumstances giving rise to such right, but not
to any such right arising as a result of any other transactions or
circumstances.

 



 

(j) _Cumulative Remedies_. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this
Agreement, all rights and remedies of either Party hereto are cumulative of
each other and of every other right or remedy such Party may otherwise have at
law or in equity, and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies shall not
prejudice or impair the concurrent or subsequent exercise of other rights or
remedies.

 



 

(k) _Governing Law_. This Agreement (and any claim or controversy arising out
of or relating to this Agreement) shall be governed by the laws of the State
of Delaware without regard to conflict of law principles that would result in
the application of any Law other than the laws of the State of Delaware.

 **FORM OF SUPPLY AGREEMENT**

 



 

This **SUPPLY AGREEMENT** (this " **Agreement** "), effective as of
, 2013 (the " **Effective Date** "), is entered into by and between **AVERY
DENNISON CORPORATION** , a Delaware corporation, through its Materials Group
and Performance Tapes Group, (" **Supplier** ") and CCL Label, Inc., a
Michigan corporation (" **Customer** "), on behalf of itself and each of its
Affiliates. Supplier and Customer are referred to herein individually as a "
**Party** " and collectively as the " **Parties**." Capitalized terms used in
this Agreement that are not defined where first used shall have the meanings
given such terms in _Annex A_ to this Agreement.

 



 

 **BACKGROUND**

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** Supplier is in the business of developing, manufacturing and
selling pressure sensitive label stock, adhesive and other base material
products;

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** Customer is an existing customer of Supplier and has been
acquiring pressure sensitive label stock, adhesive and other base material
products from Supplier under various agreements for its existing businesses
(the " **CCL Base Business** ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** pursuant to a Purchase Agreement, dated January 29, 2013 (the "
**Purchase Agreement** "), Customer has acquired the office and consumer
products business and the designed and engineered solutions business from
Supplier and Affiliates of Supplier (collectively and as more fully detailed
in the Purchase Agreement, the " **Acquired Business** ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** the Acquired Business had been acquiring pressure sensitive
label stock, adhesive and other base material products from Supplier under
various agreements; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** Customer desires to purchase from Supplier, and Supplier is
willing to manufacture and sell to Customer, products for the CCL Business and
the Acquired Business **,** and the Parties deem it desirable to establish a
single set of terms and conditions that shall govern the sale by Supplier and
the purchase by Customer of all such products.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE,** in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises
hereinafter set forth, the Parties agree as follows:

 



 

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

 **1.** ** ****PRODUCTS**

 



 

 **1.1** ** ****Purchase and Sale of Products. **From time to time during the
term of this Agreement, Customer shall purchase from Supplier and Supplier
shall supply to Customer the Products pursuant to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **1.2** ** ****Exclusivity for Exclusive Products Sold to Customer**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** **Subject to _Section 1.2(d)_ and any minimum purchase
requirements agreed by the Parties in the most current Price Card, during the
Term, the Exclusive Products and Exclusive Components shall be supplied
exclusively to Customer as provided in the Price Card. Suppliers exclusivity
obligations for the Exclusive Products and any Exclusive Components shall
apply worldwide within the Field of Use corresponding to each Product.
Exclusive Products and Exclusive Components may be sold by Supplier to third
parties for use outside of their respective Field of Use.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **For the avoidance of doubt, except with respect to components
expressly designated as Exclusive Components, the exclusivity referred to in
this _Section 1.2_ applies to the Product as a whole, and not the individual
components such as the adhesive, face stock and liner.

 



 

 **(c)** ** **Supplier may supply all Products (other than Exclusive
Products), Volume Decline Products and Products containing Volume Decline
Components to Customer on a non-exclusive basis.

 



 

 **(d)** ** **Commencing in calendar year 2014, Supplier, in its sole
discretion and after thirty (30) days prior written notice to Customer, can
elect to discontinue Customers exclusivity on (i) an Exclusive Product if
Customers purchases of such Exclusive Product in any calendar year are less
than (A) eighty five percent (85%) of the volume of purchases of such
Exclusive Product in the immediately preceding calendar year or (B) seventy
five percent (75%) of the volume of purchases of such Exclusive Product in the
twelve (12) full months prior to the Effective Date (any Exclusive Product
with respect to which Supplier makes such election, a " **Volume Decline
Product** ") or (ii) an Exclusive Component if Customers aggregate purchases
of all Exclusive Products that contain such Exclusive Component in any
calendar year are less than (A) eighty five percent (85%) of the volume of
purchases of such Exclusive Products in the immediately preceding calendar
year or (B) seventy five percent (75%) of the volume of purchases of such
Exclusive Products in the twelve (12) full months prior to the Effective Date
(any Exclusive Component with respect to which Supplier makes such election, a
" **Volume Decline Component** "). All purchase volumes referred to in this
_Section 1.2(d)_ shall be calculated in US Dollars. For the avoidance of
doubt, a Volume Decline Product shall not be considered an Exclusive Product
and a Volume Decline Component shall not be considered an Exclusive Component
for any purpose under this Agreement and regardless of any contrary statement
in any Price Card.

 



 

 **1.3** ** ****Grant of Intellectual Property Rights**. During the Term of
this Agreement, Customer hereby grants to Supplier and its Affiliates a non-
exclusive, world-wide, royalty free right and license to any intellectual
property owned by Customer solely for the purposes of manufacturing and
selling the Products to Customer and its Affiliates under this Agreement.
Customer also covenants, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, not to bring
any action or other proceeding for infringement or other violation of any
intellectual property owned or controlled by Customer with respect to any
Products manufactured and sold by Supplier or its Affiliates to Customer or
its Affiliates under this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **2.** ** ****TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE**

 



 

All purchases and sales of Products shall also be subject to Suppliers
standard Terms and Conditions of Sale, as modified from time to time by
Supplier upon not less than sixty (60) days advance written notice to Customer
(" **Standard Terms and Conditions** ").

 



 

 **3.** ** ****CONFLICTING TERMS**

 



 

 **3.1** ** ****Purchase Order**. If any Purchase Order, acknowledgement,
quotation or other purchasing document issued by either Party includes terms
or conditions that are inconsistent with or conflict with any terms or
conditions set forth in this Agreement or Price Card, the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement and the most recent Price Card shall control,
unless an authorized officer of each Party has expressly agreed in a separate
writing to such inconsistent and/or conflicting terms.

 



 

 **3.2** ** ****Standard Terms and Conditions**. If any of the terms or
conditions set forth in this Agreement conflict with the Standard Terms and
Conditions, the terms or conditions in this Agreement shall control.

 



 

 **3.3** ** ****Price Card**. If any of the terms or conditions set forth in
this Agreement conflict with the most recent Price Card, the most recent Price
Card shall control.

 



 

 **4.** ** ****PRICES AND PAYMENT**

 



 

 **4.1** ** ****Prices. **The prices for Products and the terms and conditions
under which prices may be modified from time to time shall be as set forth in
the most current Price Card agreed to by the Parties.

 



 

 **4.2** ** ****Payment Terms**. The payment terms shall be as set forth in
the most current Price Card agreed to by the Parties.

 



 

 **5.** ** ****TERM AND TERMINATION**

 



 

 **5.1** ** ****Term.** The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on
the Effective Date and continue for a period of five (5) years (the "
**Initial Term**"), unless sooner terminated as provided in this _Article
5_. Customer shall have the right to renew this Agreement for an additional
term of one (1) year (a " **Renewal Term** ") on not less than one hundred
eighty (180) days advance notice prior to the end of the Initial Term of the
Agreement. The Initial Term together with the Renewal Term is referred to
herein as the " **Term.** "

 

 ** **

 

 **5.2** ** ****Termination by Mutual Agreement**. This Agreement may be
terminated by the mutual written agreement of the Parties.

 



 

 **5.3** ** ****Termination for Cause.** Either Party may terminate this
Agreement effective immediately upon providing written notice of termination
to the other Party, if such other Party fails to cure any material breach of
this Agreement within ninety (90) days after receiving written notice of such
breach.

 



      
 

 



 

 **5.4** ** ****Effect of Termination.** Upon the expiration or termination of
this Agreement for any reason: (i) Customer shall purchase sufficient Products
to consume all raw materials used exclusively to manufacture the Exclusive
Products and Exclusive Components then held in inventory by Supplier or that
are subject to non-cancellable purchase orders or other contractual
commitments, consistent with the Forecast and with commercially reasonable
ordering practices; (ii) Supplier shall continue production and delivery of
all Products in accordance with all Purchase Orders accepted by Supplier prior
to the effective date of such expiration or termination; provided, however,
that if Supplier is terminating this Agreement due to Customers breach of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.3_, Supplier may, in its sole
discretion, cancel any such Purchase Orders in whole or in part; and (iii)
each Party shall return all Confidential Information of the other Party as
provided in _Section 7.3_ below. Any expiration or termination of this
Agreement for any reason will not affect any rights or liabilities of either
Party which may have accrued prior to the date of termination.

 



 

 **5.5** ** ****Survival.** Any terms and conditions that by their nature or
otherwise reasonably should survive any termination of this Agreement shall be
deemed to survive, including _Section 5.4_, _Articles 6_, _7_ , and _8,_ and
_Annex A_ (to the extent necessary to interpret the other surviving
provisions).

 



 

 **6.** ** ****LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

 



 

 **6.1** ** ****Limitation of Liability**.

 



 

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY SHALL
BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT, OR OTHERWISE,
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF USE OF PRODUCTION OR
LOSS OF CAPITAL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR EITHER
PARTYS PERFORMANCE OR NONPERFORMANCE HEREUNDER. EXCLUDING EACH PARTYS (I)
BREACH OF ITS CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER _ARTICLE 7_ OR (II) FRAUD,
GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, NEITHER PARTYS LIABILITY UNDER ANY
CLAIM FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR
RESULTING FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR FROM THE PERFORMANCE OR BREACH HEREOF SHALL
EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE TO SUPPLIER FOR THE PRODUCTS UNDER THE
PURCHASE ORDER OUT OF WHICH SUCH CLAIM ARISES.

 



 

 **7.** ** ****CONFIDENTIALITY**

 



 

 **7.1** ** ****Confidentiality Obligations.** All Confidential Information
shall remain the property of the applicable Disclosing Party. The Receiving
Party shall hold all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in
strict trust and confidence, and shall not disclose such Confidential
Information other than to its employees and agents who need to know such
Confidential Information solely for the purpose of performing the Receiving
Partys obligations under this Agreement and who are bound by confidentiality
agreements with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to such Confidential Information that are no less restrictive than the
confidentiality provisions of this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall not
use the Confidential Information in any manner or for any purpose, other than
in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall protect the
Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party from unauthorized use,
access, or disclosure in the same manner as the Receiving Party protects its
own Confidential Information of a similar nature, and in any event, with no
less than reasonable care taking into account the nature of the Confidential
Information. The Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party in writing
promptly upon becoming aware of any unauthorized use or disclosure of any
Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.

 



 

 **7.2** ** ****Exceptions.** The confidentiality obligations set forth in
_Section 7.1_ above shall not apply to any information that: (i) is lawfully
in the possession of the Receiving Party without restriction on disclosure at
the time of the Disclosing Partys first disclosure to the Receiving Party (as
evidenced by written records); provided that this clause (i) shall not limit
(A) Suppliers obligations with respect to Confidential Information of
Customer that was in Suppliers possession or known to Suppliers employees or
contractors prior to the Effective Date that relates exclusively to the
Acquired Business or (B) Customers obligations with respect to Confidential
Information of Supplier and its Affiliates that was in Customers possession
or known to Customers employees or contractors prior to the Effective Date
that relates exclusively to businesses of Supplier and its Affiliates other
than the Acquired Business; (ii) is disclosed to the Receiving Party by a
third party who had the right to make such disclosure to the Receiving Party
free of any confidentiality obligations; (iii) is independently developed by
the Receiving Party without reference to or use of the Disclosing Partys
Confidential Information (as evidenced by written records); or (iv) is, or
through no fault of the Receiving Party has become, generally available to the
public. In addition, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information
of the Disclosing Party to the extent that such disclosure is required by law,
a court order, or a governmental agency with jurisdiction, provided that
before making such a required disclosure the Receiving Party notifies the
Disclosing Party in writing of such required disclosure as soon as is
reasonably practicable after receiving notice of any such required disclosure,
takes commercially reasonable actions to assure the confidential handling of
the Disclosing Partys Confidential Information, including, to the extent
permissible and practicable, affording the Disclosing Party a reasonable
period of time to seek a protective order prohibiting the disclosure of the
Disclosing Partys Confidential Information, if allowed by applicable law and
cooperates with the Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Partys reasonable
request and expense, in any lawful action to contest or limit the scope of
such required disclosure.

 



 

 **7.3** ** ****Return of Confidential Information.** Upon the expiration or
termination of this Agreement for any reason, or at any time upon the
Disclosing Partys request, the Receiving Party shall return to the Disclosing
Party or destroy all tangible copies of Confidential Information in the
Receiving Partys possession or control and will erase from its computer
systems all electronic copies thereof, except that the Receiving Partys legal
counsel may retain one copy of such Confidential Information for record
purposes only.

 



 

 **7.4** ** ****Confidentiality of the Agreement.** The Parties acknowledge
and agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement, but not the
existence of this Agreement, are the

 



      
 

 



 

Confidential Information of both Parties. Neither Party shall disclose any
terms or conditions of this Agreement to any third party without the prior
written consent of the other Party, except: (i) as required by law or
regulations; (ii) to its attorneys, accountants, and other professional
advisors under a duty of confidentiality; and (iii) to a third party bound by
a duty of confidentiality in connection with obtaining financing or a proposed
merger or a proposed sale of all or part of such Partys business which
relates to this Agreement.

 



 

 **8.** ** ****GENERAL**

 



 

 **8.1** ** ****Governing Law.** This Agreement (and any claim or controversy
arising out of or relating to this Agreement) shall be governed by the laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law principles that would
result in the application of any law other than the laws of the State of
Delaware.

 



 

 **8.2** ** ****Waiver of Jury Trial**. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE
IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.2_.

 



 

 **8.3** ** ****Force Majeure.** Neither Party shall be deemed to have
defaulted under or breached this Agreement or be liable for any loss, damage,
delays, changes in shipment schedules or failure to deliver or for any other
failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term of the Agreement (other
than the payment of money) when such failure or delay is caused by or results
from causes beyond the reasonable control of the affected Party, including
fire, storms, floods, earthquakes, natural disasters, embargoes, war, acts of
war (whether war be declared or not), acts of terrorism, insurrections, riots,
strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances of third parties or any regional
or national labor disturbances, accidents, failure of carriers, inability to
obtain transportation facilities, failures by suppliers to Supplier, acts of
God or public enemies, or omissions or delays in acting by any governmental
authority (each a " **Force Majeure Event** "), and the affected Party will be
entitled to an extension for a period equal to the duration of the delay
caused thereby; provided, however, that the Party affected by such Force
Majeure Event uses diligent efforts, under the circumstances, to notify the
other Party in writing of the circumstances causing the delay or non-
performance and resumes performance as soon as reasonably possible. If the

 



      
 

 



 

Force Majeure Event is reasonably expected to delay delivery of Products by
more than ten (10) days, Customer shall also have the right, as its exclusive
remedy for any failure to supply, to purchase substitute products that are
substantially similar to the Products affected by the Force Majeure event from
third parties on a commercially reasonable basis (" **Substitute Products**
"), but for not longer than one hundred and twenty (120) days after such
failure is cured or for such shorter period as termination is permitted in any
commercially reasonable contract for Substitute Products entered into by
Customer during such failure.

 



 

 **8.4** ** ****Assignment.** Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in
whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by either Party without
the prior written consent of the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
during the Term, this Agreement (i) must be assigned by either Party to its
successor or assign that acquires all or substantially all of that Party or
the business to which this Agreement relates, whether by security or asset
sale, acquisition, merger, reverse merger or any other bona fide transfer and
(ii) may be collaterally assigned as part of any bona fide secured lending
arrangement. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this
_Section 8.4_ shall be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by
the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

 



 

 **8.5** ** ****Waiver.** Except where a specific period for action or
inaction is provided herein, neither the failure nor any delay on the part of
any Party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege under this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part
of any Party hereto of any such right, power or privilege, nor any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or
privilege. The failure of a Party hereto to exercise any right conferred
herein within the time required shall cause such right to terminate with
respect to the transaction or circumstances giving rise to such right, but not
to any such right arising as a result of any other transactions or
circumstances.

 



 

 **8.6** ** ****Independent Contractors.** Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to constitute a single employer, joint employer, co-employer,
alter-ego, agency, partnership, joint venture or similar relationship between
either Party or any of such Partys Affiliates, on the one hand, and the other
Party or any of the other Partys Affiliates, on the other hand. Each Party is
acting pursuant to this Agreement solely as an independent contractor.

 



 

 **8.7** ** ****Counterparts.** This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile, . _pdf_ or email), each of which when
executed shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

 



 

 **8.8** ** ****Severability.** Whenever possible, each provision or portion
of any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to
be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion
of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision

 



      
 

 



 

or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be
reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been

Buyers and its affiliates use, registration of, application to register,
licensing, enforcement or authorization to others to use the Acquired Marks in
connection with the OCP Field as provided in this Agreement.

 



 

2. _ADC s Rights and Obligations_.

 



 

2.1. _Rights_. Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that, as between Buyer and
its affiliates, on the one side, and ADC and its affiliates on the other side,
ADC and its affiliates are the sole and exclusive owners of the Retained Marks
in connection with the Retained Business and, subject to the terms of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, have the worldwide right to use, register, apply to register,
license, enforce and authorize others to use the Retained Marks on or in
connection with goods and/or services in the Retained Business.

 



 

2.2. _Obligations_.

 



 

(a) ADC and its affiliates shall have no right hereunder to use the Acquired
Marks or any trademarks confusingly similar to the Acquired Marks, except as
follows:

 



 

(i) ADC and its affiliates shall have the right to use the Acquired Marks to
the extent necessary to perform its duties under the Purchase Agreement or any
of the Ancillary Agreements (as defined in the Purchase Agreement);

 



 

(ii) ADC and its affiliates shall have the right to exhaust any existing
inventory or works-in-process as of the Effective Date or Ancillary Materials
bearing the Acquired Marks until December 31, 2014;

 



 

(iii) The ADC Materials Group shall have the right to manufacture and sell
products using the Graphics Division Logo depicted on _Exhibit C_ and/or the
Acquired Marks and use Ancillary Materials bearing the Graphics Division Logo
and/or the Acquired Marks for twelve (12) months after the Effective Date, and
will be permitted to sell any products and use any Ancillary Materials bearing
such marks remaining in its inventory for up to eighteen (18) months after the
Effective Date; and

 



 

(iv) Avery Dennison Japan K.K. and ADC Retail Branding and Information
Solutions (RBIS) shall have the right to manufacture and sell products using
the Acquired Marks and use Ancillary Materials bearing the Acquired Marks for
twelve (12) months after the Effective Date, and will be permitted to sell any
products and use any Ancillary Materials bearing such marks remaining in its
inventory for up to eighteen (18) months after the Effective Date.

 



 

(b) ADC agrees that it shall not use, and shall cause its affiliates to not
use, the Retained Marks or any trademarks confusingly similar to the Retained
Marks in connection with the making, selling, promoting or distributing of any
products or services or for any other purpose in the OCP Field, except to the
extent necessary to perform its duties under the Purchase Agreement or any of
the Ancillary Agreements (as defined in the Purchase Agreement).

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 2.2(a), ADC agrees that it shall (and shall
cause its affiliates to) always use the "triangle logo" oriented so that the
top of the triangle is pointed directly up (not in a tilted orientation) and
in association with the mark AVERY DENNISON, so as to reduce the likelihood of
confusion with the Avery Logo. Notwithstanding the

 



      
 

 



 

foregoing, ADC and its affiliates will continue to have the right to
manufacture and sell products and to use Ancillary Materials, outside of the
OCP Field, bearing the ADC Logo as a standalone logo (i.e., not in combination
with AVERY DENNISON) for twelve (12) months after the Effective Date, and will
be permitted to sell any products and using such Ancillary Materials bearing
such standalone logo remaining in its inventory for up to eighteen (18) months
after the Effective Date. For clarity, ADC has no obligation to use the ADC
Logo and may use a different logo or design (other than the Avery Logo or any
logo confusingly similar thereto) or no logo or design in association with the
mark AVERY DENNISON.

 



 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, ADC and its affiliates shall retain, and the
Retained Marks include, all rights to use "Avery Dennison" as its company
name, as a brand name, service mark and trademark, and all marks incorporating
"Avery Dennison" and /or related logos (other than, for clarity, the Avery
Logo and any names or marks assigned to Buyer under the Purchase Agreement), a
sampling of which is set forth on _Exhibit B_, provided that such use is
outside of the OCP Field. ADC agrees that it shall not use, and shall cause
its affiliates to not use, the Retained Marks in a manner that is intended to
emphasize the AVERY portion over the DENNISON portion of such name and mark or
in any manner confusingly similar to the Acquired Marks.

 



 

(e) The Parties acknowledge that there are certain trademarks owned by ADC
that contain elements of both the Retained Marks and the Acquired Marks. Two
examples of these marks are listed in the fourth category on _Exhibit B_.
These marks are being retained by ADC and ADC will discontinue all use
globally of such marks, including withdrawal or abandonment of any
registration or application for registration.

 



 

2.3. _Acknowledgement of Rights_. To the extent that ADC and its affiliates
comply with Sections 2.1 and 2.2, Buyer and its affiliates shall not object to
ADCs and its affiliates use, registration of, application to register,
licensing, enforcement or authorization to others to use the Retained Marks in
connection with the Retained Business as provided in this Agreement.

 



 

3. _Licensing and Transfers_.

 



 

3.1. _Licensing by Buyer_. Buyer and its affiliates may license or permit
sublicensing of any or all of its rights hereunder to another party in the OCP
Field, provided that __ the license terms are at least as restrictive as those
set forth in this Agreement as it concerns the use of the Acquired Marks, and
that such licensing party takes reasonable actions to cause the licensee to
comply with such terms and conditions of this Agreement. Buyer shall be
responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any such licensee.

 



      
 

 



 

3.2. _Permitted Transfers by Buyer_. Buyer and its affiliates may assign or
otherwise transfer each of the Acquired Marks, provided that any such
assignment or transfer shall be made expressly subject to all terms and
conditions of this Agreement in a written Trademark Use Agreement signed by
all parties to the assignment or transfer and stating that the assignee or
transferee shall comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Buyer
shall give ADC prompt written notice of any such assignment or transfer of an
Acquired Mark and shall furnish ADC with a fully-executed copy of the
Trademark Use Agreement. ADC shall be expressly identified in the Trademark
Use Agreement as a third party beneficiary of the agreement.

 



 

3.3 _Licensing by ADC_. ADC and its affiliates may license or permit
sublicensing of any or all of its rights hereunder to another party outside
the OCP Field, provided that the license terms are at least as restrictive as
those set forth in this Agreement as it concerns the use of the Retained
Marks, and that such licensing party takes reasonable actions to cause the
licensee to comply with such terms and conditions of this Agreement. ADC shall
be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any such licensee.

 



 

3.4. _Permitted Transfers by ADC_. ADC and its affiliates may assign or
otherwise transfer each of the Retained Marks, provided that any such
assignment or transfer shall be made expressly subject to all terms and
conditions of this Agreement in a written Trademark Use Agreement signed by
all parties to the assignment or transfer and stating that the assignee or
transferee shall comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. ADC
shall give Buyer prompt written notice of any such assignment or transfer of a
Retained Mark and shall furnish Buyer with a fully-executed copy of the
Trademark Use Agreement. Buyer shall be expressly identified in the Trademark
Use Agreement as a third party beneficiary of the agreement.

 



 

4. _Ownership, Registration and Maintenance of Marks_.

 



 

4.1. _ADC s Ownership of Retained Marks and Goodwill_. Buyer acknowledges the
sole ownership by ADC and its affiliates of the Retained Marks and all related
goodwill. Buyer covenants that it will not, and shall cause its affiliates to
not, at any time do or cause to be done any act or thing impairing or tending
to impair the right, title or interest of ADC or its affiliates in the
Retained Marks. Buyer agrees that it will not, and shall cause its affiliates
to not, at any time during the term of this Agreement, challenge (a) the
validity of the Retained Marks, (b) ownership of the Retained Marks by ADC or
its affiliates, (c) any registration or application for registration of any
Retained Marks existing as of the Effective Date, or (d) any application for
registration of any Retained Marks after the Effective Date, provided that
application for registration is outside of the OCP Field. Buyer shall not
attempt to register, and shall cause its affiliates to not register, the
Retained Marks alone or as part of its own trademarks or attempt to register
any marks confusingly similar to the Retained Marks (in each case other than
the mark AVERY and the Avery Logo, as permitted hereunder). Buyer

 



      
 

 



 

agrees that it will not, and shall cause its affiliates to not, at any time
during the term of this Agreement, disparage, degrade or do anything else that
would likely to be harmful to the Retained Marks.

 



 

4.2 _Buyer s Ownership of Acquired Marks and Goodwill_. ADC acknowledges the
sole ownership by Buyer and its affiliates of the Acquired Marks and all
related goodwill. ADC covenants that it will not, and shall cause its
affiliates to not, at any time do or cause to be done any act or thing
impairing or tending to impair the right, title or interest of Buyer or its
affiliates in the Acquired Marks. ADC agrees that it will not, and shall cause
its affiliates to not, at any time during the term of this Agreement,
challenge (a) the validity of the Acquired Marks, (b) ownership of the
Acquired Marks by Buyer or its affiliates, (c) any registration or application
for registration of any Acquired Marks existing as of the Effective Date, or
(d) any application for registration of any Acquired Marks within the OCP
Field filed after the Effective Date. ADC shall not attempt to register, and
shall cause its affiliates to not register, the Acquired Marks alone or as
part of its own trademarks or attempt to register any marks confusingly
similar to the Acquired Marks (in each case other than the mark AVERY DENNISON
and the ADC Logo, as permitted hereunder). ADC agrees that it will not, and
shall cause its affiliates to not, at any time during the term of this
Agreement, disparage, degrade or do anything else that would likely to be
harmful to the Acquired Marks.

 



 

5. _Confusion Not Likely_. The Parties mutually believe that the continued use and registration of the Acquired Marks and the Retained Marks on and in connection with the goods and/or services relating to their respective businesses in accordance with the terms of this Agreement is not likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception as to the source or sponsorship of their respective goods and services because of, among other reasons, distinctions in those respective goods and services. The Parties agree to continue to take reasonable action, and to cause their affiliates to take reasonable action, to reduce the likelihood of confusion due to the co-existence and registration of their respective marks hereunder, to notify one another of any actual confusion that is brought to their attention in connection with their respective names and marks hereunder, and to mutually cooperate, as is reasonable under the circumstances, to rectify any actual or potential confusion resulting therefrom.

 



 

6. _Further Assurances_.

 



 

6.1 _General Assistance_. At any time and from time to time, promptly upon
reasonable request and at the expense of the requesting Party, each Party
shall, and shall cause its affiliates to:

 



 

(a) sign and deliver to the requesting Party any and all further instruments
and consents, and shall take further reasonable action, at the requesting
Partys cost for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, in order to give the
requesting Party the full benefit of this Agreement; and

 



       
 

 



 

(b) cooperate with and assist the other Party to enforce their respective
marks, including in connection with seizure or other actions against
counterfeit goods being sold under either Partys marks.

 



 

6.2 _Registration Assistance_. Without limitation to Section 6.1, at the
request of a Party, at the requesting Partys cost for reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses, the other Party will (i) execute coexistence agreements or
consents consistent with this Agreement and in a form suitable for filing in a
local trademark office to permit registration, recordation or assignment of
such Party **** s Marks as permitted hereunder, (ii) amend its applications
or registrations for the Acquired Marks to exclude products or services
outside of the OCP Field or for the Retained Marks to exclude products or
services in the OCP Field, and (iii) otherwise cooperate to determine and
implement the best manner to effect such registration, recordation or
assignment so as to provide each Party and its affiliates the full ownership
and use of the Retained Marks (with respect to ADC and its affiliates) and the
Acquired Marks (with respect to Buyer and its affiliates) as provided
hereunder.

 



 

6.3 _Licenses_. In the event and to the extent that, notwithstanding the
foregoing in this Section 6, a Party or its affiliate is not permitted to
register, record, or assign a Retained Mark (in the case of ADC) or an
Acquired Mark (in the case of Buyer) in a particular jurisdiction, upon the
request of such Party the other Party hereby grants to such Party a royalty-
free, fully paid-up, sublicenseable license to use the Retained Mark or
Acquired Mark, as applicable, in such jurisdiction in a manner consistent with
this Agreement until such time as such assignment and recordal occurs. At the
requesting Partys request and expense, the other Party shall use reasonable
efforts to file, prosecute, and maintain applications or registrations for
such licensed Mark(s) in such jurisdiction(s) until such assignment and
recordal occurs. If requested by either Party, the Parties shall cooperate to
execute a separate short-form license agreement documenting the foregoing
license and containing any other provisions to the extent required under
applicable law.

 



 

7. _Limitation of Liability_. NEITHER PARTY NOR ITS AFFILIATES SHALL UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, EVEN IF NOTIFIED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF, BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES HEREUNDER FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LIABILITY FOR ANY LOST SALES, PROFITS OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES ARISING SOLELY FROM BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

8. _Term; Termination_.

 



 

8.1 _Term_. Subject to Section 8.2, the term of this Agreement (the " _Term_
") shall be perpetual.

 



 

8.2 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated only by mutual written
agreement of the Parties at any time. For clarity, this Agreement may not be
terminated by any Party for breach of this Agreement by any other Party, it
being understood and agreed that the non-breaching Party may seek injunctive
relief,

 



      
 

 



 

specific performance, and/or damages (subject to Section 7) against the
breaching Party or its affiliates or licensees. If any Party and its
affiliates and licensees abandon all use of all of its respective Marks (by
discontinuing all use for a period of three consecutive years worldwide), the
other Party and its affiliates shall be released from all obligations under
this Agreement.

 



 

9. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

9.1. _Waiver_. Except where a specific period for action or inaction is
provided herein, neither the failure nor any delay on the part of any Party
hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any Party
hereto of any such right, power or privilege, nor any single or partial
exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.
The failure of a Party hereto to exercise any right conferred herein within
the time required shall cause such right to terminate with respect to the
transaction or circumstances giving rise to such right, but not to any such
right arising as a result of any other transactions or circumstances.

 



 

9.2. _Assignment_. Subject to Sections 3.2 and 3.4, this Agreement shall inure

whether oral or written, by any Party or by any director, officer, employee,
agent, affiliate or representative of any Party.

 



 

9.4. _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed
in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but
all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery

enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in Section 9.5. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted
by law.

 



 

9.8. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 9.8.

 



 

9.9. _Remedies Not Limited_. Nothing contained herein shall prevent or limit

Section 7), specific performance or temporary, preliminary and permanent
injunctive relief with respect to any breach of this Agreement by the other

9.10. _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that
the other Parties would be irreparably damaged in the event that any of the
terms or provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Therefore, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each of the Parties
hereby agrees that the

 



      
 

 



 

other Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, and to enforce
specifically the performance by such first Party, and each Party hereby agrees
to waive the defense in any such suit that the other parties to this Agreement
have an adequate remedy at law, and hereby agrees to waive any requirement to
post any bond in connection with obtaining such relief. The equitable remedies
described in this Section 9.10 shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of,
any other remedies at law or in equity that the parties hereto may elect to
pursue.

 



 

9.11. _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision
had never been contained herein.

 



 

9.12 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such
terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of
such terms. Unless otherwise specified, any agreement, instrument or statute
defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is
referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements
or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by
succession of comparable successor statutes, and including all attachments
thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a person are also
to its permitted successors and assigns. An "affiliate" of a Party means any
person or entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
with, such Party, where "control" means ownership of fifty percent (50%) or
more of the outstanding voting securities or other interests having voting
rights with respect to the election of the board of directors or similar
governing authority (but only as long as such person or entity meets these
requirements).

 



 

9.13 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of the Parties hereto
acknowledges that each Party to this Agreement has been represented by counsel
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would
require

 



      
 

 



 

interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the
drafting Party has no application and is expressly waived.

 



 

9.14 _Independent Parties_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to constitute a single employer, joint employer, co-employer, alter-
ego, agency, partnership, joint venture or similar relationship between ADC or
any of ADCs affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of Buyers
affiliates, on the other hand. Each Party is acting pursuant to this Agreement
solely as an independent contractor.

 



      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been signed on behalf of each of the
Parties hereto as of the date first written above.
