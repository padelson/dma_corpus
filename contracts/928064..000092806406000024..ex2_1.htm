**MERGER  CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OR CANCELLATION OF SHARES IN THE 
MERGER**

 

 

3.1 _Share  Consideration for the Merger; Conversion or Cancellation of
Shares in the  Merger_.  At the  Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part  of  Parent, Newco, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the holders of any  outstanding shares of the
Company's Capital Stock described in Section 4.2  below, each share of such
Capital Stock (collectively, the " _Shares_ ," and  each, a " _Share_ ") 
shall  be treated as follows:

 

 

(a) Each  Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other  than  Dissenting Shares (as defined below) and Shares owned by
Parent, Newco or  any  direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent
(collectively, " _Parent  Companies_ ")  or by  any of the Company's
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries) shall be  cancelled and
extinguished and converted into the right to receive, pursuant  to  Section
3.3, an amount equal to $6.50 per Share in cash (the " _Merger 
Consideration_ "),  payable to the holder thereof, without interest thereon,
upon the surrender  of  the certificate formerly representing such Share.

 

 

(b) Each  Share issued and outstanding and owned by the Parent Companies or
any of  the  Company's direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding, be
cancelled and retired, without  payment of any consideration therefor, and
shall cease to exist.

 

 

(c) Each  share of common stock of Newco issued and outstanding immediately
prior to  the  Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued,
fully paid and  nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

 

3.2 _Stock  Options and Warrants_.

 

 

(a) Prior  to  the Effective Time, the Board of Directors or Special
Committee shall adopt  such  resolutions or shall take such other actions as
are required to approve the  measures contemplated by this Section 3.2. The
Company shall use its best  efforts to obtain any necessary consent of the
holders of Options and Warrants  (each as defined below) to effect this
Section 3.2.

 

 

(b) The  Company shall take all necessary steps to ensure that, at the
Effective Time,  each option to acquire shares of the Capital Stock ("
_Option_ ")  which  has been granted under the Company's 1994 Stock Option
Plan and the Company's  2004 Equity Incentive Plan, or otherwise
(collectively, the " _Option  Plans_ "),  and  each warrant to purchase
Capital Stock (" _Warrant_ "),  and,  in each case, which is outstanding at
the Effective Time, to the extent and  only  to the extent that such Option
or Warrant is then exercisable in whole or  in  part in accordance with
their respective terms, shall be cancelled. In  consideration of such
cancellation, the holder of each such Option or Warrant  shall be entitled to
receive, upon compliance with the provisions noted below,  a  lump sum cash
payment in an amount equal to the product of the  following:

 

 

(i) the  excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share
exercise price  of  each such Option or Warrant, multiplied by

 

 

(ii) the  number of vested shares of Capital Stock covered by such Option or
Warrant  to  the extent not previously exercised

 

 

_less_   applicable taxes required to be withheld pursuant to  Section
3.2(f).

 

 

(c) If,  in  accordance with Section 3.2(b)(i) above, there is no excess of
the Merger  Consideration over the per share price of any Option or Warrant,
then any  such  Option or Warrant shall automatically be cancelled without
any consideration  as  of the Effective Time.

 

 

(d) As  of the  Effective Time, each of the Option Plans and any other plan,
program or  arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in  respect  of the Capital Stock shall be terminated and cancelled
(without any liability  on  the part of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
other than as expressly set  forth in this Section 3.2).

 

 

(e) No  party  to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of any Option
or Warrant  for any  cash delivered to a public official pursuant to and in
accordance with any  abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

 

(f) Parent  shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deduct and withhold from
the cash  otherwise payable to the holder of any Option or Warrant pursuant
to this  Section 3.2, such amounts as the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation  reasonably and in good faith determine are required to be
deducted and withheld  with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code  of  1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),  or  any
social security, FICA or Medicare tax Law, or any other provision of 
federal, state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are 
so  withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be
treated  for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Option
or Warrant  holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the  Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(g) The  Company and the Special Committee shall take any and all actions
(including,  but  not limited to, giving requisite notices to, and using
their best efforts  to  obtain all necessary consents from, holders of
Options and Warrants advising  them of such cancellations and any rights
pursuant to this Section 3.2) as  are necessary to (i) fully advise holders
of Options of their rights under  the Option Plans and the Options in
connection with the Merger and the rights  of  holders of Warrants of their
rights under the Warrants in connection with  the  Merger, and (ii)
effectuate the provisions of this Section 3.2 under  the terms of the Option
Plans and Warrants. From and after the Effective  Time,  other than as
expressly set forth in this Section 3.2, no holder of an  Option or Warrant
shall have any rights in respect thereof other than to  receive  payment (if
any) for the Options or Warrants as set forth in this  Section 3.2, and
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall have  any liability or
obligation under any of the Option Plans or, other than  the  obligation to
make any required payment set forth in this Section 3.2, with  respect to the
Options or Warrants.

 

 

(h) Any  payment to be made to a holder of any Option or Warrant in
accordance with  this  Section 3.2 shall be subject to Parent's prior
receipt of (i) the Option or  Warrant, as the case may be, for cancellation
or delivery of an instrument  reasonably satisfactory to Parent effecting the
cancellation of the Option  or  Warrant, as the case may be, and (ii)
written instructions from the holder  of  such Option or Warrant specifying
the manner in which any such payment is  to be  made, including the name to
which a check for such payment should be made  and  the address where such
check should be sent, or appropriate wire transfer  instructions. Upon
receipt of such items, Parent shall direct the Paying  Agent  (as defined
below) to make any such payment in respect of such Option or  Warrant. Until
surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this  Section 3.2, each
Option and Warrant shall represent for all purposes only  the right to
receive the payments, if any, pursuant to this Section 3.2. 

 

 

3.3 _Payment  for Securities in the Merger_.  The  manner of making payment
for Shares, Options and Warrants in the Merger shall  be  as follows:

 

 

(a) Prior  to  the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a reputable bank
or trust company  or  other entity reasonably acceptable to the Company to
act as paying agent  for the  holders of Shares, Options and Warrants in
connection with the Merger (the  " _Paying  Agent_ "),  and  to receive
the funds to which the holders of Shares will become entitled  pursuant to
Section 3.1(a), and to which the holders of Options and  Warrants may become
entitled pursuant to Section 3.2. Immediately prior to  the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with  the  Paying Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of Shares, Options and Warrants  the  funds
necessary to make the payments contemplated by Sections 3.1 and 3.2, 
respectively (the " _Payment  Fund_ ").  The  Paying Agent shall, pursuant
to irrevocable instructions, make the payments  contemplated by Sections
3.1(a) and 3.2, respectively, out of the Payment  Fund  in accordance with
the provisions of Section 3.3(c) below.

 

 

(b) The  Paying Agent shall invest the Payment Fund as directed by Parent or
Newco  in (i)  investment grade money market instruments, (ii) direct
obligations of the  United  States of America, (iii) obligations for which
the full faith and credit  of the  United States of America is pledged to
provide for the payment of principal  and  interest, (iv) commercial paper
rated the highest quality by either Moody's  Investors Services, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's Corporation, or (v)  certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers' acceptances of  commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion, in each case having  maturities not to exceed
thirty (30) days and as designated by Parent, with  any  interest earned
thereon being payable to Parent. Parent shall cause the Payment  Fund to be
promptly replenished to the extent of any losses incurred as a  result  of
the aforementioned investments. All earnings thereon shall inure to the 
benefit of Parent. If for any reason (including losses) the Payment Fund 
is  inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of Shares shall be
entitled  under  Section 3.1(a) and this Section 3.3, and to which holders
of Options  or Warrants shall be entitled under Section 3.2 and this Section
3.3,  Parent shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. The Payment
Fund  shall  not be used for any purpose except as expressly provided in
this  Agreement.

 

 

(c) As  soon  as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying
Agent shall  mail  to each holder of record (other than holders of
certificates representing  Dissenting Shares and for Shares referred to in
Section 3.1(b)) of a  certificate or certificates which immediately prior to
the Effective Time  represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_
"),  (i) a  notice and letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall  be  effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only  upon  proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent, and shall be in  such  form and have such other provisions as Parent
may reasonably specify), and  (ii)  instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates for payment  therefor. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent,  together with such letter
of transmittal duly executed and properly completed,  and any other required
documents, the holder of such Certificates shall be  entitled to receive for
each Share represented by such Certificates the Merger  Consideration,
without any interest thereon, _less_   any  required withholding of taxes,
and the Certificates so surrendered shall  forthwith be cancelled. With
respect to Options and Warrants, Parent shall  direct the Paying Agent to
make payments to the holders of Options and Warrants  in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3.2(h).

 

 

(d) If  payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
a  Certificate so surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment  that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and
otherwise  in  proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall  pay  to the Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of the  payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate  surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that  such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered in accordance  with the provisions of this Section 3.3, each
Certificate (other than  certificates representing Dissenting Shares or
Shares referred to in  Section 3.1(b)) shall represent for all purposes only
the right to receive,  for each Share represented thereby, the Merger
Consideration, and shall not  evidence any interest in, or any right to
exercise the rights of a shareholder  or other equityholder of, the Company
or the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(e) Any  portion of the Payment Fund made available to the Paying Agent which
remains  unclaimed by the former shareholders, holders of Options and holders
of Warrants  of the Company for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered  to  Parent, upon demand of Parent, and any former
shareholders, holders of Options  and holders of Warrants of the Company
shall thereafter look only to Parent  for  payment of their claim for the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable in  respect  of the Shares held by
such former shareholder or for payment of their claim  for  the aggregate
amount payable in respect of Options or Warrants pursuant to  Section 3.2
held by such former holders of Options or Warrants, as the case  may be, in
each case without any interest thereon and subject to any taxes  required to
be withheld.

 

 

(f) Neither  the Paying Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable
to any  shareholder of the Company for any Merger Consideration or cash
delivered  to a  public official pursuant to and in accordance with any
abandoned property,  escheat or similar Law.

 

 

(g) The  Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger  Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
former  holder  of Shares, Options or Warrants of the Company such amounts
as Parent and  the  Surviving Corporation reasonably and in good faith
determine are required  to be  deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the  Code,  or any social security, FICA or
Medicare tax Law or any other provision of  federal, state, local or foreign
tax Law. To the extent that amounts are  so  withheld by the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for  all  purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the former holder of Shares,  Options or Warrants, as
the case may be, in respect of which such deduction  and  withholding was
made by the Paying Agent.

 

 

3.4 _Dissenting  Shares_. 

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Section
302A.471 of the MBCA  is applicable to the Merger, shares of Company Common
Stock that are issued  and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and which are held by  a  holder who has not voted such Shares in favor
of the Merger, who will have  delivered, prior to any vote on the Merger, a
written demand for the fair  value  of such Shares in the manner provided in
Section 302A.473 of the MBCA and  who, as of the Effective Time, will not
have effectively withdrawn or lost  such  right to dissenters' rights ("
_Dissenting  Shares_ ")  will  not be converted into or represent a right
to receive the Merger Consideration  pursuant to Section 3.1(a), but the
holder thereof will be entitled only to  such rights as are granted by
Section 302A.473 of the MBCA. Each holder of  Dissenting Shares who becomes
entitled to payment for such Shares pursuant  to  Sections 302A.471 and
302A.473 of the MBCA will receive payment therefor  from  the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with the MBCA; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that
if  any such holder of Dissenting Shares will have effectively withdrawn
such  holder's demand for appraisal of such Shares or lost such holder's
right to  appraisal and payment of such shares under Section 302A.473 of the
MBCA,  such holder will forfeit the right to appraisal of such Shares and
each such  Share will thereupon be deemed to have been canceled, extinguished
and  converted, as of the Effective Time, into and represent the right to
receive  payment from the Surviving Corporation of the Merger Consideration,
as provided  in Section 3.1(a).

 

 

(b) The  Company will give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written notice of
intent  to  demand fair value, any withdrawal of such notice and any other
instrument  served  pursuant to Section 302A.473 of the MBCA received by the
Company and (ii)  the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to  notice of intent to demand fair value under Section 302A.473
of the MBCA.  The Company will not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent,  voluntarily make any payment with respect to any such notices or
offer to  settle  or settle any such demand.

 

 

3.5 _No  Further Rights or Transfers_.  Except  for the surrender of the
Certificates representing the Shares in exchange  for  the right to receive
the Merger Consideration with respect to each Share  or the  perfection of
dissenters' rights with respect to the Dissenting Shares, at and  after the
Effective Time, a holder of Shares shall cease to have any rights  as a 
shareholder of the Company, and no transfer of Shares shall thereafter be 
made  on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

3.6 _Certain  Company Actions_.  Prior  to the Effective Time, each of the
Company and Parent shall take all such  steps  as may be required (to the
extent permitted under applicable Law) to cause  any  dispositions of Shares
(including derivative securities with respect to Shares)  resulting from the
transactions contemplated by Article III of this Agreement  by  each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of  Section 16(a) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") with
respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3  promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 

 

**ARTICLE  IV.**

 

 



 

 

**REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 

 

The  Company hereby makes the representations and warranties in this Article
IV  to  Parent and Newco, except as qualified or supplemented by sections in
the  Company  Disclosure Schedule attached hereto. Each such Section of the
Company  Disclosure Schedule is numbered by reference to representations and
warranties  in a specific Section of this Article IV or a specific Section
of  Article VI hereof; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that an  exception or
qualification to, or supplemental information regarding,  representations,
warranties or covenants in one Section of the Company  Disclosure Schedule
shall also be deemed disclosed with respect to each other  warranty,
representation or covenant to which the exception, qualification  or 
supplemental disclosure reasonably relates and to which its relevance is 
reasonably apparent.

 

 

4.1 _Corporate  Organization and Qualification_.  Each of  the Company and
its Subsidiaries (as hereinafter defined in Section 9.1) is  a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under  the  Laws of
its respective jurisdiction of incorporation and is qualified and  in  good
standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the properties 
owned, leased or operated or the business conducted by it require such 
qualification, except where failure to so qualify or be in good standing 
would  not have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined
in  Section 9.1). Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has all
requisite  corporate or limited liability company, as the case may be, power
and authority  to own its properties and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted.  The Company has previously made available to Parent
complete and correct  copies  of the Company's Restated Articles of
Incorporation, as amended and in effect on  the date hereof (the " _Company 
Articles_ "),  and  Amended and Restated Bylaws, as amended and in effect on
the date hereof  (the " _Company  Bylaws_ "),  and  the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or other comparable documents)  of  each of its
Subsidiaries.

 

 

4.2 _Capitalization;  Subsidiaries_. 

 

 

(a) The  authorized capital stock of the Company (the " _Capital  Stock_
")  consists of 50,000,000 shares, par value $0.01 per share, 40,000,000
shares  of  which are designated as common shares (the " _Common  Shares_

11,060,160  Common Shares were issued and outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding  shares of Capital Stock have been duly authorized and validly
issued and  are  fully paid and nonassessable and are free of preemptive
rights. All of the  issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock were
issued in compliance  with  any preemptive rights and any other statutory or

all applicable federal  and  state securities Laws. 947,451 Common Shares
were reserved for issuance upon  the  exercise of outstanding awards
pursuant to the Option Plans, and 225,000  Common  Shares were reserved for
issuance upon the exercise of outstanding Warrants.  _Section 4.2(a)_  of
the  Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct, true and complete

or Warrant. Except as set  forth  above and in _Section 4.2(a)_  of the 
Company Disclosure Schedule, there are not as of the date hereof, and at 
the  Effective Time there will not be, any subscriptions, outstanding or
authorized  options, warrants, convertible securities, calls, rights
(including preemptive  rights), commitments or any other agreements of any
character to which the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by
which it may be bound,  requiring it to issue, transfer, sell, purchase,
redeem or acquire any shares  of  its capital stock or any securities or
rights convertible into, exchangeable  for, or evidencing the right to
subscribe for, any shares of its capital stock,  or requiring it to give any
Person the right to receive any benefit or rights  similar to any rights
enjoyed by or accruing to the holders of its shares  of  capital stock or
any rights to participate in the equity or net income of  the  Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in _Section 4.2(a)_  of the 
Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no shareholders' agreements, voting 
trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the Company or any  of
its  Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound or, to the Knowledge of
the  Company, between or among shareholders, in each case with respect to
the  transfer or voting of any capital stock of the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries.

 

 

(b) _Section 4.2(b)_  of the  Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true
and complete list of the names,  jurisdictions of organization, and
jurisdictions of qualification as a foreign  entity of each of the Company's
Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in  _Section 4.2(c)_  of the  Company

requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver  this
Agreement and each instrument required hereby to be executed and delivered 
by it at the Closing, to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder  and
to  consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement and
each  instrument required hereby to be executed and delivered by the Company
at  the  Closing and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated  hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the Special
Committee and  no  other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company
are necessary to  authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby,  other than the approval of the Merger and the adoption

and delivered by the Company  and,  assuming that this Agreement constitutes
the legal, valid and binding agreement  of Parent and Newco, constitutes the
legal, valid and binding agreement of  the  Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except  that such enforceability may be
limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency,  reorganization, moratorium or other
similar Laws now or hereafter in effect  relating to creditors' rights
generally, and (ii) general principles of equity  (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity  or  at law).

 

 

4.4 _Consents  and Approvals; No Violation_.

approval, authorization or permit, or  to  make such filing or notification,
would not, individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect, or adversely  affect the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or (H) such  filings, consents,
approvals, orders, registrations and declarations as may  be  required as a
result of the status or identity of Parent and/or  Newco;

Disclosure Schedule, result in a violation or breach of, or constitute  (with
or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give  rise to 
any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration or Lien) under any  of
the  terms, conditions or provisions of any note, license, agreement or
other  instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries  is a  party or by which any of its or their assets may be
bound, except for such  violations, breaches and defaults (or rights of
termination, cancellation  or  acceleration or Lien) as to which requisite
waivers or consents have been  obtained or which would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably  be  expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, or adversely affect the  consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; or

 

 

(iv) assuming  that the consents, approvals, authorizations or permits and
filings or  notifications referred to in this Section 4.4 are duly and timely
obtained  or made and the approval of the Merger and the adoption of this
Agreement  by the  Company's shareholders have been obtained, violate any
Order (as defined in  Section 4.14), or any statute, rule or regulation
applicable to the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries, or to any of their
respective assets, except  for  violations which would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably  be  expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

 

(b) The  affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of
the  outstanding Shares in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the
Merger  (the " _Company  Shareholder Approval_ ")  is the  only vote of
the holders of any class or series of the Company's or its  Subsidiaries'
securities necessary to approve this Agreement, the Merger and the  other
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

4.5 _SEC  Reports; Financial Statements_.

under which they were made, not misleading.

 

 

(b) The  consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements
of income  and cash flows (including the related notes thereto) of the
Company included  in  the Company SEC Reports, as of their respective dates,

requirements and the published  rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, (ii) were prepared  in  accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ")  applied on a basis consistent with prior

the lack of footnotes), and (iii) presented  fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of  the  Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of their respective dates, and  the

financial  statements, to normal year-end adjustments), all in accordance
with GAAP. 

 

 

4.6 _Absence  of Certain Changes or Events_.  Except  as set forth in
_Section 4.6_  of the  Company Disclosure Schedule or as contemplated by
this Agreement, since  December 31, 2005, the Company has not suffered any
Company Material  Adverse Effect, and to the Knowledge of the Company, no
fact, condition or  circumstance exists that would reasonably be expected to
have, individually  or  in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect

 

 

4.7 _Litigation_.  Except  as set forth in _Section 4.7_  of the  Company
Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement there are no  actions,
claims, suits, proceedings, governmental investigations, inquiries  or

Company, threatened against the Company  or  any of its Subsidiaries, or any
property or asset of the Company or any of  its  Subsidiaries, except for
any Actions that, individually or in the aggregate,  are  not reasonably
likely to result in a Company Material Adverse  Effect.

 

 

4.8 _Absence  of Undisclosed Liabilities_.  Except  as  set forth in the
Company SEC Reports and except for obligations in connection  with the
transactions contemplated hereby, neither the Company nor any of  its 
Subsidiaries has any material liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether  accrued, absolute or contingent, asserted or unasserted, due or to
become  due)  other than liabilities and obligations (i) reflected on the
balance sheet  included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for
the fiscal quarter  ended March 31, 2006, or (ii) incurred after March 31,
2006 in the ordinary  course of business consistent with past practice.

 

 

4.9 _Proxy  Statement_.  The  Proxy Statement (as defined below) and other
materials distributed to the  Company's shareholders in connection with the
Merger, including any amendments  or supplements thereto, will comply in all
material respects with applicable  federal securities Laws, and the Proxy
Statement will not, at the time that  it  or any amendment or supplement
thereto is mailed to the Company's shareholders,  at the time of the
Shareholders Meeting (as defined below) or at the Effective  Time, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any  material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make  the  statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,  not
misleading, except that no representation is made by the Company with 
respect to information supplied by Newco or Parent expressly for inclusion

filed  all  federal, state, local and foreign tax returns (including, but
not limited  to,  income, franchise, sales, payroll, employee withholding
and social security  and  unemployment) which were or (in the case of
returns not yet due but due on  or  before the date of the Closing, taking
into account any valid extension of  the  time for filing) will be required
to be filed with the appropriate taxing  authority. All such tax returns
accurately reflect in all material respects  all  liabilities for taxes for
the periods covered thereby, and the Company and  its  Subsidiaries have

penalties and withholding amounts owed by the Company or any such
Subsidiary,  other than amounts being contested in good faith for which
appropriate reserves  have been included on the balance sheet of the
appropriate Person. Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
accruals and reserves for current  taxes reflected in the financial
statements included in the Company SEC Reports  are adequate in all material
respects to cover all taxes accruable through  the  respective dates thereof
(including interest and penalties, if any, thereon)  in  accordance with
GAAP consistently applied.

 

 

(ii) Neither  the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written
notice of any  material claim made by a governmental authority in a

not file tax returns  that  the Company or such Subsidiary is or may be
subject to taxation by that  jurisdiction.

 

 

(iii) No  unpaid  tax deficiencies have been proposed or assessed in writing
against the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries and no material tax
deficiencies, whether paid  or  unpaid, have been proposed or assessed in
writing against the Company or  any of  its Subsidiaries since January 1,
2003.

 

 

(iv) Except  as  set forth in _Section 4.10(a)(iv)_  of the  Company

a  tax  sharing agreement, as a transferee or successor, or otherwise.
Neither the  Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any material
tax sharing,  tax  indemnity or other agreement or arrangement with any
entity not included  in the  Company's consolidated financial statements
most recently filed by the Company  with the SEC. No Person has any right of
claim, reimbursement, allocation  or  sharing against any tax refunds
received or due to be received by the  Company.

consented to any extension of time with respect to a tax assessment or 
deficiency or has waived any statute of limitations in respect of taxes. 
Except  as  set forth in _Section 4.10(b)_  of the  Company Disclosure
Schedule, (i) none of the federal income tax returns of  the  Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has been examined by the Internal Revenue  Service during
the last six (6) taxable years, (ii) no tax audit, examinations  or other
administrative or judicial proceedings are pending or being conducted,  or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, with respect to any taxes  due 
from or with respect to or attributable to the Company or any Subsidiary  of
the  Company or any tax return filed by or with respect to the Company or
any  Subsidiary of the Company, and (iii) no written notification of an
intent  to  audit, to examine or to initiate administrative or judicial
proceedings has  been  received by the Company or by any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

 

(c) _Liens_.  Except  as set forth in _Section 4.10(c)_  of the  Company
Disclosure Schedule, there are no tax Liens upon any property or  assets  of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for Liens for current taxes 
not yet due and payable and Permitted Liens.

 

 

(d) _Withholding  Taxes_.  The  Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
properly withheld and timely paid  in  all material respects all taxes which
it was required to withhold and pay  in  connection with or relating to
salaries, compensation and other amounts paid  or  owing to its employees,
consultants, creditors, shareholders, independent  contractors or other third
parties. All Forms W-2 and 1099 required to be  filed  with respect thereto
have been timely and properly filed.

 

 

(e) _Other  Representations_. 

 

 

(i) Except  as  set forth in _Section 4.10(e)_  of the  Company Disclosure
Schedule, there is no contract, agreement, plan or  arrangement to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or  to  which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is bound, including, but not  limited to, the
provisions of this Agreement, covering any Person that,  individually or

parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code  or any

events or  accounting methods employed prior to the Closing, (C) has any
excess loss  account (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-19),

consented to the inclusion of a copy of its written opinion in its  entirety
in the Proxy Statement.

 

 

4.20 _Property_.

any transaction with the Company material  to the  Company between January

6.2 _No  Solicitation of Transactions_. 

 

 

(a) The  Company has, and has caused each officer, director or employee of,
or any  investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of the
Company,  to immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
activities,  discussions, solicitations, communications or negotiations with
any Third  Party  (as defined below) conducted prior to the date hereof with
respect to any  Competing Transaction (as defined below). The Company shall
not, nor shall  it  permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it
authorize or permit any officer,  director or employee of, or any investment
banker, attorney or other advisor  or  representative of, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to, (i) solicit  or  initiate, encourage, or facilitate,
directly or indirectly, any inquiries  relating to, or the submission of, any
proposal or offer, whether in writing  or  otherwise, from any Person other
than Parent, Newco or any Affiliates thereof  (a " _Third  Party_ ")  to 
acquire beneficial ownership (as defined under Rule 13(d) of the Exchange 
Act)  of all or more than fifteen percent (15%) of the assets of the Company
and  its  Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or fifteen percent (15%) or more
of any class  of  equity securities of the Company pursuant to a merger,
consolidation or other  business combination, sale of shares of stock, sale
of assets, tender offer,  exchange offer or similar transaction or series of
related transactions,  which  is structured to permit such Third Party to
acquire beneficial ownership  of more  than fifteen percent (15%) of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole, or fifteen
percent (15%) or more of any class of equity  securities of the Company (a "
_Competing  Transaction_ ");  (ii)  participate or engage in any
discussions or negotiations with any Third Party  regarding any Competing
Transaction, or furnish to any Third Party any  information or data with
respect to or access to the properties of the Company  in connection with a
Competing Transaction, or take any other action to  facilitate the making of
any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably  be  expected to lead to,
any Competing Transaction; or (iii) enter into any  agreement with respect to
any Competing Transaction, approve or recommend  or  resolve to approve or
recommend any Competing Transaction, or enter into  any  agreement requiring
it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger  and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding  the  foregoing
sentence or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the  Company 
receives (in the absence of any violation of this Section 6.2) a bona fide, 
written proposal or offer for a Competing Transaction by a Third Party prior 
to  the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, which the Special
Committee  determines in good faith (after consulting the Special Committee's
independent  financial advisor) (A) is reasonably likely to result in terms
which are  more  favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of
Shares than the  Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (B)  is  reasonably capable of being consummated ( _provided_
,  that  the Company, including the Special Committee, and any of its
advisors, shall  be  permitted to contact such Third Party and its advisors
solely for the purpose  of  clarifying the proposal and any material
contingencies and the capability  of  consummation) (a " _Superior 
Competing Transaction_ "),  then  the Company may, in response to an
unsolicited request therefor and subject  to  compliance with Section
6.2(b), furnish information with respect to the  Company and its Subsidiaries
to, and participate in discussions and negotiations  directly or through its
representatives with, such Third Party. Notwithstanding  the foregoing, the
Company shall not provide any non-public information to  any  such Third
Party unless the Company provides such non-public information  pursuant to a
nondisclosure agreement. The Company shall be permitted to  waive  the
provisions of any "standstill" agreement between the Company and a Third 
Party to the extent necessary to permit such Third Party to submit a
Competing  Transaction that the Special Committee believes, in its good faith
judgment,  is  reasonably likely to result in a Superior Competing
Transaction. Nothing  contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Special
Committee from (i)  complying with any applicable Law, rule or regulation,
including, without  limitation, Rule 14d-9 and Rule l4e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act,  (ii)  making any disclosure to its shareholders required
by applicable Law, rule  or  regulation or by the rules and regulations of
NASDAQ, or (iii) otherwise  making  such disclosure to the Company's
shareholders or otherwise that the Special  Committee (after consultation
with counsel) concludes in good faith is necessary  in order to comply with
its fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under  applicable Law.

 

 

(b) The  Company shall advise Parent orally and in writing within three (3)
business  days after receipt of any proposal or offer for a Competing
Transaction made  in  accordance with Section 6.2(a) of (i) any proposal for
a Competing  Transaction received by any officer or director of the Company
or, to the  Knowledge of the Company, any financial advisor, attorney or
other advisor  or  representative of the Company, and (ii) the material
terms of such Competing  Transaction (but not the identity of the entity
proposing the Competing  Transaction). The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status  of, and any material changes to, the terms
of any such Competing Transaction  proposal in a timely manner.

 

 

(c) In  the  event the Special Committee determines that it has received a
proposal for  a  Superior Competing Transaction and determines in good faith
(after consultation  with counsel) that taking any or all of the following
actions is necessary  in  order to comply with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, and _provided_ ,  that  neither the Company nor any
representative of the Company has breached any  of  the provisions of this
Section 6.2, the Company and the Special Committee  may (i) withdraw, modify
or change the Board of Director's approval or  recommendation of this
Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approve or recommend  to the  Company's
shareholders such Superior Competing Transaction, (iii) terminate this 
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.4(iii), and (iv) publicly announce 
the Board of Director's intention to do any or all of the  foregoing.

 

 

6.3 _Reasonable  Best Efforts to Complete Transactions_.

 

 

(a) Subject  to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the parties
hereto shall  cooperate with the other and use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or  cause  to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary,  proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate
and make effective,  in  the most expeditious manner possible, the Merger
and the other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, including using
its reasonable best efforts  to  obtain all necessary or appropriate
waivers, consents and approvals, to effect  all necessary registrations,
filings and submissions (including, but not  limited  to, (i) filings under
the HSR Act, which shall be made within thirty (30)  days after the date of
this Agreement, and any other submissions requested  by  the Federal Trade
Commission or Department of Justice, (ii) the filings referred  to in
Sections 4.4(a)(ii) and 5.3(b), and (iii) such filings, consents,  approvals,
orders registrations and declarations as may be required under  the  Laws of
any foreign country in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  conducts
any business or owns any assets, which shall be made within ten  (10) 
business days after the date of this Agreement), and to lift any injunction 
or  other legal bar to the Merger (and, in such case, to proceed with the
Merger  as  expeditiously as possible), subject, however, to the requisite
votes of the  shareholders of the Company.

 

 

(b) Each  of  the parties hereto agrees to cooperate with each other in
taking, or causing  to  be taken, all actions necessary to delist the Common
Shares from NASDAQ and  to  terminate registration under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ ,  that  such delisting and termination shall not be effective
until the end of the  day  upon which the Effective Time occurs.

 

 

(c) Each  of  the Company and Parent shall keep the other reasonably
informed of the status  of  their respective efforts to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby,  including by furnishing the other with
such necessary information and reasonable  assistance as it may reasonably
request in connection with its preparation  of  necessary filings or
submissions of information to any governmental authority  and by giving
prompt notice of (i) any representation or warranty made by  it  contained
in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material  respect,
(ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material  respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied  by  it
under this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that no  such notification
provided pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above shall affect  the 
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the 
conditions to or obligations of the parties under this Agreement, (iii) any 
notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of 
such  Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) any notice or other
communication relating  to an investigation or restraint from any
governmental authority in connection  with the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (v)  any  Action commenced or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, on the one hand, or  Parent's knowledge, on the
other hand, threatened against, relating to or  involving or otherwise
affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,  on the  one hand, and
Parent or Newco, on the other hand, and which, if pending on  the  date of
this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant  to
Article IV or Article V, as the case may be, or which relate to the 
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Parent 
shall keep the Company informed of material developments with respect to 
the  implementation of the financing of the transactions contemplated
hereby.  Each of  the Company and Parent may, as it deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably  designate any competitively sensitive material
provided to the other under  this  Section 6.3(c) as "outside counsel only"
and, in such event, such material  and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside  legal  counsel of the recipient and
shall not be disclosed by such counsel to non-legal  directors, officers,
employees or other advisors or representatives of the  recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source  of  the materials
or its legal counsel.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 6.3
or elsewhere in this  Agreement, if any governmental authority that has the
authority to enforce  any antitrust Law seeks, or authorizes its staff to
seek, a preliminary  injunction or restraining order to enjoin consummation
of the Merger, none  of  the parties hereto shall be required to take or
agree to take any action  which  such party reasonably believes would be
prohibited or restricted under such  preliminary injunction or restraining
order, or shall be required to waive  any  of the conditions to the Merger.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to use
its reasonable efforts  or take any action pursuant to this Section 6.3 if in
the good faith  opinion of the Special Committee (after consultation with
counsel) such actions  might be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Company's shareholders  under applicable Law.

 

 

6.4 _Shareholders  Meeting; Proxy Statement_. 

 

 

(a) The  Company, acting through the Special Committee, shall:

 

 

(i) (A)  use  all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and,
within  thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement, file with the SEC
a  proxy statement for the purposes of considering and taking action upon
this  Agreement (the " _Proxy  Statement_ "),  (B)  obtain and furnish the
information required to be included by it in the Proxy  Statement and, after

by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and any preliminary  version
thereof, and (C) undertake to obtain the necessary approvals by its 
shareholders of this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions

applicable  Law;

 

 

(ii) include  in the Proxy Statement the unanimous recommendation of the
Special Committee  that the shareholders of the Company vote in favor of the
approval of this  Agreement and the Merger and use its reasonable best

Shareholders Meeting; _provided_ ,  that,  notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, the  Special Committee may withdraw,
modify or amend its recommendation if, in  the  good faith opinion of the
Special Committee (after consultation with counsel),  such recommendation
might be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the  Company's
shareholders under applicable Law, in which case any such withdrawal, 
modification or amendment shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement; 

 

 

(iii) duly  call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its
shareholders  for  the purpose of considering and taking action upon this
Agreement and the  Merger  (the " _Shareholders  Meeting_ "),  to be

with the SEC; and

 

 

(iv) if  at any  time prior to the Shareholders Meeting any information
relating to the Company,  or any of its Affiliates, officers or directors,
should be discovered by  the  Company which should be set forth in an

necessary to make the statements therein,  in  light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the  Company shall promptly

information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to  the  extent

fully cooperate  with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement,
and shall, upon  request, furnish the Company with all information concerning
it and its  Affiliates as the Company may deem reasonably necessary or
advisable in  connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement. If at
any time prior  to  the Shareholders Meeting any information relating to the
Parent, or any of  its  Affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by Parent which should  be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement, so that  it  would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any  material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the  circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, Parent shall promptly  notify the Company and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing  such  information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required  by  Law,
disseminated to the shareholders of the Company

mutually agree upon any press  releases or public announcements pertaining to

or make any such public announcements  prior to such consultation and

to consult in good faith with the other parties before  issuing any such
press releases or making any such public announcements;  _provided_ ,  that
no  such consultation shall be  required  to make any disclosure or

_Indemnified  Parties_ ")  in the  Company Articles and Company Bylaws, and
of the Company's Subsidiaries in their  respective Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaws, as in effect as of the date  hereof with respect to matters
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,  including the Merger, shall
continue in full force and effect for a period  of  not less than six (6)
years from the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  (i) all
rights to indemnification in respect of any such claims (each, a  " _Claim_
")  asserted or made within such period shall continue until the
disposition  of such  Claim, and (ii) Parent and Newco shall acquire "tail"
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary insurance policies
covering Claims with  respect to matters occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, including  the  Merger, that are no less favorable to the
Indemnified Parties than the Company's  existing directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary insurance  policies in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

(b) This  Section 6.7 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to
grant third  party  rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding
on all successors  and  assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation. Each of the  Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce
the covenants contained  in this  Section 6.7. The obligations under this
Section 6.7 shall  not  be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such
a manner as to adversely  affect any Indemnified Party (or any other Person
who is a beneficiary under  the "tail" policy referred to in paragraph (a)
above) (and their respective heirs,  successors and assignees)  without 
the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party (or other Person who  is
a  beneficiary under such "tail" policy) (and their respective heirs, 
successors and assignees).  The  rights of each Indemnified Party (and other
Person who is a beneficiary under  such "tail" policy) (and their respective
heirs,  successors and assignees)  under  this Section 6.7 shall be in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any  other  rights that such
Persons may have under the certificate or articles of  incorporation, bylaws
or other equivalent organizational documents, any  indemnification agreements
to which such Indemnified Party or other Person  is a  party, or applicable
Law (whether in a proceeding at Law or in  equity).

 

 

(c) In  the  event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns  (i)  consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person
and shall not be  the  continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii)  transfers or conveys a majority of its properties and
assets to any Person,  then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the  successors, assigns and transferees of the Surviving
Corporation, as the  case  may be, assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.7.

 

 

(d) To  the  extent permitted by law, at rights of indemnification for the
benefit of  any  Indemnified Party shall be mandatory rather than
permissive.

 

 

6.8 _Employees_.

 

 

(a) At  the  Effective Time, Parent agrees that, except  for those
employees resigning as of the Effective Time as contemplated in  _Section 
4.11(b)_   of the  Company Disclosure Schedule, all  employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective  Time shall
be offered comparable continuing employment at rates of pay and  with 
benefits under employee benefit plans, programs, arrangements and policies 
for  the benefit of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries that in
the  aggregate are no less favorable to such employees than the rates of pay
in  effect for the twelve (12) months prior to the Effective Time and the
Company  Plans set forth in _Section 6.8(a)_  of the  Company Disclosure
Schedule, provided that payment of any amounts payable  under  the Company's
incentive bonus program described in _Section 6.8(a)_  of the  Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be made in the ordinary course to Persons  employed
by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the end of the calendar  year 
2006, and shall not be accelerated or pro-rated as a result of the
occurrence  of  the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.
Neither this  Section 6.8 nor any other provision of this Agreement shall
limit the  ability or the right of the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries to  terminate the employment, or to alter any applicable rates
of pay or benefits  under employee benefit plans, programs, arrangements and
policies, of any  employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who
continue as employees  of  the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Continuing  Employees_ ")  after  the
Effective Time (subject to the rights of any such employees pursuant  to
any  agreement which is to be binding after the Effective Time as set forth
in  _Section 6.8(b)_  of the  Company Disclosure Schedule). All service
credited to each Continuing Employee  shall be recognized by Parent for all
purposes, including vacation and for  purposes of eligibility, vesting and
benefit accruals under any employee  benefit  plan provided by Parent for
the benefit of the employees. Without limiting  the  foregoing, Parent shall
not treat any Continuing Employee as a "new" employee  for purposes of any
pre-existing condition exclusions, waiting periods, evidence  of insurability

(b) In  the  event of termination of this Agreement without consummation of

Termination Fee by Parent pursuant to the provisions of this  Section 8.5
shall be the exclusive remedy of Parent and Parent shall not be  entitled to
any further or other rights, claims or remedies at law or in  equity,  all

Reimbursable  Expenses actually paid by the Company to Parent pursuant to
this Section  8.5(c)  and Section 8.5(d).

 

 

(d) If  either  Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement without

or 8.3(iv), then the  Company shall promptly following such termination, upon
written request from  Parent and receipt of reasonable substantiation
therefor, reimburse Parent  for  all out-of-pocket fees and expenses
incurred by Parent in connection with  the  transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including without limitation  reasonable fees and expenses of
Parent's legal counsel, accountants and  financial advisors, commitment fees
paid or payable by Parent to potential  financing sources, and fees and
expenses of potential financing sources that  Parent is required to pay or
reimburse (" _Reimbursable  Expenses_ "),  all  as and to the extent
reasonably documented by Parent, up to a maximum amount  reimbursable under
this Section 8.5(d) of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000),  _provided_   that
in  the event the Company disputes any claim for Reimbursable Expenses,
such  disputed claim shall be submitted for arbitration to a single
arbitrator,  as  agreed upon by the Parent and the Company, for arbitration
in accordance  with  the rules then in force of the American Arbitration
Association (" _AAA_ ")  in New  York, New York. In the absence of agreement
between the Company and the Parent  on the identity of an arbitrator within
15 days after arbitration is sought  by  either party, the arbitral tribunal
shall consist of three arbitrators, one  arbitrator to be selected by each of
the Company and the Parent and the third  arbitrator to be selected by
agreement of the first two arbitrators. In the  event either party hereto
fails to select an arbitrator within 30 days after  arbitration is sought by
either party or if the two arbitrators selected  by the  parties cannot
agree as to the third arbitrator within 15 days after they  are  selected,
such arbitrator or arbitrators shall be appointed by the AAA at  the 
request of either of the parties. The decision rendered by the arbitrator 
or  arbitrators shall be accompanied by a written opinion in support
thereof.  Such  decision shall be final and binding upon the parties in
dispute without right  of  appeal. Judgment upon any such decision may be
entered into in any court  having  jurisdiction thereof, or application may
be made to such court for a judicial  acceptance of the decision and an order
of enforcement. Costs of the arbitration  shall be assessed by the arbitrator
or arbitrators against any and all of  the  parties in dispute, and shall be
paid promptly by the party or parties so  assessed.

performance of any of the obligations or other acts  of  the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations  and  warranties
of the other parties contained herein or in any document, certificate  or
writing delivered pursuant hereto, or (iii) waive compliance by the other 
parties hereto with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. 
Any  agreement on the part of any party hereto to any such extension or
waiver  shall  be valid only if set forth in any instrument in writing
signed on behalf  of such  party. The failure of any party hereto to assert
any of its rights hereunder  shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

inure solely to the benefit of each party  hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Nothing in this Agreement,  express or implied, other
than the right to receive the consideration payable  in  the Merger pursuant
to Article III hereof, is intended to or shall confer  upon  any other
Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever  under  or
by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the
provisions of Section 6.7 shall inure to the benefit of and be  enforceable
by the Indemnified Parties.

 

 

10.10 _Obligation  of Parent_.  Whenever this Agreement requires Newco to
take any action, such requirement  shall be deemed to include an undertaking
on the part of Parent to cause  Newco  to take such action and a guarantee
of the performance thereof.

 

 

10.11 _Severability_.  If any  term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable  of  being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions  and  provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and  effect  so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated  hereby is not affected in a
manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination  that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being  enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this  Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as  possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated  hereby are
fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

 

 

 

10.12 _Specific  Performance_.  The  parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the parties would  not  have any adequate remedy at law
in the event that any of the provisions of  this  Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms. It  is  accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance  of  the
terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they  are 
entitled at law or in equity.
