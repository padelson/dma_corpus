AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ ") dated January 11,
2008 (the " _Agreement Date_ "), by and among AngloGold Ashanti Limited, a
corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of South Africa ("
_Parent_ "), AngloGold Ashanti USA Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("
_Member_ "), GCGC LLC, a Colorado limited liability company and a direct
wholly owned subsidiary of Member (" _Merger Sub_ ," and, together with Parent
and Member, the " _Parent Parties_ ") and Golden Cycle Gold Corporation, a
Colorado corporation (" _Target_ ").

  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Member and Target deem it
advisable and in the best interests of their respective entities and
shareholders or members, as applicable, that Target merge with and into Merger
Sub (the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, and such Boards of Directors and member have approved this Agreement
and the Merger;

  

WHEREAS, as an inducement to Parent, Member and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
with the approval of Targets Board of Directors, Parent has entered into
voting agreements with each of the Persons set forth on _Exhibit A_ attached
hereto, pursuant to which such parties have, among other things, agreed to
support the Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth therein
(collectively, the " _Voting Agreements_ "); and

  

WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger will
qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the
United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ").

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

  

ARTICLE I

  



  

THE MERGER

  

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, at the Effective Time, Target shall merge with and into Merger Sub and
the separate existence of Target shall thereupon cease and Merger Sub shall be
the surviving entity in the Merger (sometimes referred to herein as the "
_Surviving Entity_ ") as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The
Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 7-90-204 of the Colorado
Business Corporation Act (the " _CBCA_ "), including the Surviving Entitys
succession to and assumption of all rights and obligations of Merger Sub and
Target.

  

1.2 _Effective Time of the Merger_. The Merger shall become
effective (the " _Effective Time_ ") upon the later of (i) the date and time
of filing of a properly executed Statement of Merger relating to the Merger
with the Secretary of State of Colorado in accordance with the CBCA (the "
_Statement of Merger_ ") and (ii) at such later time as the parties shall
agree and set

  



        

* * *

     



  

forth in such Statement of Merger. The Statement of Merger shall be filed as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date.

  

1.3 _Tax Treatment_. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute
a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, and this Agreement shall
constitute a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury regulation
section 1.368-2(g). Each party hereto agrees to treat the Merger as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for all U.S.
federal income tax purposes, and to not take any position on any Tax Return or
otherwise take any Tax reporting position inconsistent with such treatment,
unless otherwise required by a "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313 of the Code that such treatment is not correct.

  

ARTICLE II

  



  

THE SURVIVING ENTITY

  

2.1 _Articles of Organization_. The articles of organization of
Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
articles of organization of the Surviving Entity at and after the Effective
Time until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof and the
CBCA.

  

2.2 _Operating Agreement_. The Operating Agreement of Merger Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Operating
Agreement of the Surviving Entity at and after the Effective Time until
thereafter amended in accordance with its terms, the Surviving Entitys
articles of organization and Operating Agreement and the Colorado Limited
Liability Company Act (" _CLLCA_ ").

  

2.3 _Officers_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers of
Merger Sub shall be the officers of the Surviving Entity until their
respective successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Surviving Entitys Operating Agreement and the CLLCA. Effective at the
Effective Time, all of the officers and employees of Target shall resign.

  

ARTICLE III

  



  

CONVERSION OF SHARES

  

 3.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any
capital stock described below:

  

(a) All shares of common stock of Target, no par value per share ("
_Target Common Shares_ "), that are held in Targets treasury shall be
canceled and cease to exist and no cash, Parent capital stock or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

 (b) Subject to _Section 3.2(i)_, each issued and outstanding
Target Common Share (other than Target Common Shares cancelled pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)_) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive
0.29 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") American Depositary Shares of Parent (each,
an " _ADS_ ") rounded up to the next whole ADS, with each whole ADS
representing one ordinary share, par value 25 South African cents per share,
of Parent (the " _Parent Ordinary Shares_ "). The ADSs to be issued for each
Target

  



   

2

  
       

* * *

     
  



  

  Common Share pursuant to this Agreement are referred to herein as the "
_Common Conversion Consideration_." All such Target Common Shares, when so
converted, shall be retired, shall cease to be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled, and the holder of a certificate that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, represented such Target Common Shares (a "
_Stock Certificate_ "), shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive, upon the surrender of such Stock Certificate in
accordance with _Section 3.2_, the Common Conversion Consideration, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and any amounts payable
pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the
Agreement Date and the Effective Time, the ADSs or Target Common Shares are
changed into a different number of shares or a different class because of any
stock dividend or distribution, subdivision, reorganization,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares,
the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such
event.

  

(c) The membership interests of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted into membership
interests of the Surviving Entity, such that the converted membership
interests will represent all of the issued and outstanding membership
interests of the Surviving Entity and will be held by an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent.

  

(d) All Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender of Stock
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Stock
Certificates and the Target Common Shares formerly represented thereby, and
from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers effected on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Entity of
Target Common Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

        



  |  

3.2

  |  

_Surrender and Payment_. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) _Exchange Agent and Exchange Fund._ Parent shall authorize one
or more transfer agent(s) to act as exchange agent hereunder (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") with respect to the Merger. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall: (i) deposit, or cause to be deposited, with The Bank of New
York, as depositary for the ADSs, or any successor depositary thereto, a
number of Parent Ordinary Shares equal to the aggregate number of ADSs to be
issued as Common Conversion Consideration; and (ii) deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent the receipts representing such aggregate
number of ADSs (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall
deliver the applicable Merger Consideration in exchange for surrendered Stock
Certificates pursuant to _Section 3.1_ out of the Exchange Fund. Except as
contemplated by _Section 3.2(d)_, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose.

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures._ As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each
holder of record of a Stock Certificate a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Stock Certificates
to the Exchange Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions

  



   

3

  
       

* * *

     



  

 as Parent and Target may reasonably specify) for use in the exchange
contemplated by _Section 3.1_ and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Stock Certificates for payment therefor in accordance with this
Agreement (together, the " _Exchange Instructions_ "). Upon surrender of a
Stock Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such
letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to the Exchange Instructions, the
holder of such Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor ADSs (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a
physical certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of ADSs that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.2(i)_ , plus any amount payable pursuant to 
_Section 3.2(d)_.

  

(c) _Transferred Target Common Shares._ If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the registered holder of
Target Common Shares represented by the Stock Certificate(s) surrendered in
exchange therefor, no such issuance or payment shall be made unless (i) the
Stock Certificate(s) so surrendered have been properly endorsed and otherwise
are in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such issuance
has paid to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a
result of such issuance to a Person other than the registered holder or
established to the Exchange Agents satisfaction that such Tax has been paid
or is not applicable.

  

(d) _Dividends and Distributions on ADSs._ No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to ADSs with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Stock
Certificate with respect to the ADSs that such holder would be entitled to
receive upon surrender of such Stock Certificate in accordance with _Sections
3.1 or 3.2(i)_. Following surrender of any such Stock Certificate, there shall
be paid to such holder of ADSs issuable in exchange therefor, without
interest, (a) as soon as practicable after the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such ADSs, and (b) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such ADSs.
For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of ADSs, all ADSs
to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence as if such ADSs were issued and outstanding
as of the Effective Time.

  

 (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Target Common Shares one year
after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and
any such holder who has not exchanged such holders Stock Certificates
in accordance with this _Section 3.2_ prior to that time shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Entity, as a general creditor thereof, to exchange
such Stock Certificates pursuant to  _Section 3.1_ or  _3.2(i)_ or to pay
amounts to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)_.
Neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder of
Target Common Shares for any such ADSs (or 

  



   

4

  
       

* * *

     



  

 dividends or distributions with respect thereto) from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  

(f) _Lost Certificates._ If any Stock Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Target Common Shares represented by such Stock Certificate,
without interest.

  

(g) _Withholding._ Each of Parent, the Surviving Entity and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Target Common
Shares such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent
determine is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision
of state, local, or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such
payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving
Entity or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Target Common
Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

  

(h) _Shares Held by Target Affiliates._ Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, no ADSs shall be issued in exchange for any Stock
Certificate to any affiliate of Target (identified pursuant to _Section 7.16_
) until such Person shall have delivered to Parent a duly executed Affiliate
Letter as contemplated by _Section 7.16_ (if such Section is in effect).

  

(i) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip or fractional
ADSs or book-entry credit representing such fractional share interests shall
be issued upon the surrender of Stock Certificates. Each holder of Target
Common Shares exchanged pursuant to this _Article III_ who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of an ADS (after taking into account
all Stock Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu of
such fractional share, one ADS. The parties acknowledge that rounding up
fractional ADSs was not separately bargained for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate
and accounting problems that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional ADSs.

3.3

  |  

_Stock Options._ 

---|---|--- 
  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Target and Parent shall take all
such action as may be necessary to cause each unexpired and unexercised
option to purchase Target Common Shares (a " _Target Stock Option_ ")
granted under Targets 1992 Stock Option Plan (the " _1992 Plan_ "), 1997
Officers and Directors Stock Option Plan (the " _1997 Plan_ ") and the 2002
Stock Option Plan (the " _2002 Plan_ " and, together with the 1992 Plan and
1997 Plan, the " _Target Stock Option Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested,
to be 

  



   

5

  
       

* * *

     



  

 automatically converted at the Effective Time into an option (a "
_Substituted Option_ ") to purchase a number of ADSs equal to the number of
Target Common Shares that could have been purchased (assuming full vesting)

(i) Neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries has distributed stock
of another Person, or has had its stock distributed by another Person in a
transaction that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part
by Code Sections 355 or 361 within the two-year period preceding the date of
this Agreement.

  

 (j) None of Target or its Subsidiaries will be required to include
any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income
for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as
a result of any (i) change in method of accounting for a taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) "closing agreement" as

deductible as a result of Code §162(m) (or any corresponding provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law).

  

(m) Target operates at least one significant historic business line, or owns
at least a significant portion of its historic business assets, in each case
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations § 1.368-1(d).

Reports filed and publicly available prior to the Agreement Date or Section

Subsidiaries has received any notice from any Person that the business of
Target or any of its Subsidiaries has been or is being conducted in violation

respect. Neither Target nor any Subsidiary has received any notice that any
material Target Permit will be terminated or modified or cannot be renewed in

any occurrence or any event which (with notice or the lapse of time or both)
would constitute such a breach or default or permit termination, modification
or acceleration under the policy. Neither Target nor any Subsidiary has

maintained by the Joint Venture) cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of
business, and has no knowledge of any reasonable basis for any such non-

any third party any interest or right to acquire any interest in the Owned

passage of time could reasonably be expected to result in any such default) or
breach of any of the terms and conditions of those Property Agreements by
Target or any of its Subsidiaries, or to Targets knowledge, by any of the
other parties to those Property Agreements. Except as set forth on Section
4.15(b) of the Target Disclosure Letter, to Targets knowledge, the party

of their respective assets are bound (except for any agreement relating to the
Joint Venture to which Parent or one of its Subsidiaries is a party to which
such agreements the representations and warranties contained in this _Section
4.16_ shall not apply). Target has provided or will make available to Parent

Except as set forth in Section 4.16 of the Target Disclosure Letter, each
Material Contract is valid and binding and in full force and effect and Target
and each of its Subsidiaries have performed all obligations required to be
performed by them under each Material Contract in all material respects. To
Targets knowledge, there does not exist, nor has Target or any of its
Subsidiaries received written notice of, any material breach of or violation
or default under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Material
Contract and neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written
notice of the desire of the other party or parties to any such contract to

the Target shareholders, at the time of the Target Meeting and at the
Effective Time, and, in the case of the F-4, when it becomes effective under
the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

negotiations with any Person regarding the sale of all or substantially all of

their affiliates or, to the knowledge of Parent, any of Parents shareholders
has taken or agreed to take any action that would prevent the Merger from
constituting a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. The Parent Parties and their affiliates are not aware of any fact or
circumstance that would prevent the Merger from constituting a reorganization

Exchange Act) that are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to Parents management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Parent required under
the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

independent auditors have identified any "significant deficiencies" or
"material weaknesses" in Parents or any of its Subsidiaries internal
controls as contemplated under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parent
has no knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim,
whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective internal accounting controls, including any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices. No
attorney representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation
by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board
of Directors of Parent or any committee thereof or to any director or officer
of Parent.

of which it becomes aware that results in any representation or warranty made
by such party contained in this Agreement being untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect or Target, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, being
unable to comply with or satisfy any of its covenants or agreements hereunder;
_provided, however_ , that the receipt of any information or the delivery of

 afford access to the properties, books or records of Target or any of its

Representatives knows or has reason to believe is contemplating making an
Acquisition Proposal; or 

  

(iii) accept an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement,
including any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in

intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement in the circumstances
contemplated by _Section 7.2(b)(iii)_ ) or (B) requiring it to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other Transaction (each, an
" _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Target and its Board of Directors
may take any actions described _Section 7.2(a)(ii)_ with respect to any Person
at any time prior to obtaining the Target Shareholders Approval if, prior to

such Person (and such Acquisition Proposal was not initiated, solicited or
knowingly encouraged or facilitated by Target or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives after the Agreement Date and in
violation of this Agreement);

  

(ii) the Board of Directors of Target determines in good faith by
resolution duly adopted (after consultation with outside legal counsel and
receipt of the written opinion of PI Financial or another independent
investment bank of similar stature in the industry that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a "Superior Proposal" hereunder, a copy of which shall
immediately be provided to Parent) that such proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal from such Person, and that such action is necessary for the Board of
Directors of Target to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

  

(iii) contemporaneously with furnishing such information to, or
entering into discussions with, such Person, Target (A) enters into a
confidentiality agreement with such Person on terms no less restrictive than
those in the Confidentiality Agreement and (B) provides written notice to
Parent to the effect that it is furnishing information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, such Person; and

  

 (iv) to the extent permitted by applicable Law (it being understood
that that any contractual prohibition against the activities set forth in
this  _Section 7.2(b)(iv)_ and any judicial remedies arising from the
enforcement thereof shall not render the activities set forth in this

  promptly informed, in all material respects, of the status and terms of

disclosure, in each case, to the extent required by applicable Law.

  

(d) Any violation of this _Section 7.2_ by any of Targets
Subsidiaries or Representatives, whether or not such Representative is so
authorized and whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on
behalf of Target or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to
be a material breach of this Agreement by Target.

  

(e) As promptly as practicable after receipt thereof (but in no event
more than 48 hours after its receipt thereof), Target shall advise Parent in
writing of any request for information from a Person that has made, or Target
reasonably believes may be contemplating, an Acquisition Proposal, or any
Acquisition Proposal received from any Person, or any inquiry made or

to any Acquisition Proposal, and the material terms and conditions of such
request, Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, discussions or negotiations, and
Target shall promptly provide to Parent copies of any written materials
received by Target, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives in connection with any of the foregoing and
any correspondence related thereto, and the identity of the Person or group
making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or with whom any
discussions or negotiations are taking place. Target agrees that it shall
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning Target or its
Subsidiaries provided to any other Person or group in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal that was not previously provided to Parent at the same
time that it provides such information to such other Person. Target shall keep
Parent fully and currently informed of the status of any Acquisition
Proposals, including the identity of the parties and price involved and any

 " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") nor (ii) shall Target or any of

Target Shareholders Approval and subject to Targets compliance at all times

party (and such Acquisition Proposal was not initiated, solicited or knowingly
encouraged or facilitated in violation of this Agreement), (ii) the Board of
Directors of Target determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and receipt of the written opinion from PI Financial or
another independent investment bank of similar stature in the industry that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a "Superior Proposal" hereunder, a copy
of which shall immediately be provided to Parent, that the Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Offer and that the Adverse Recommendation
Change is necessary in order for the Board of Directors of Target to comply
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (iii) Target provides
written notice to Parent (a " _Notice of Change_ ") advising Parent that it is
contemplating making such an Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying the

determination, together with a copy of the written opinion of PI Financial or
another independent investment bank of similar stature in the industry ;
_provided, however,_ that (x) the Board of Directors of Target may not make
such an Adverse Recommendation Change until the fourth business day after
receipt by Parent of the Notice of Change and (y) during such four business
day period, at the request of Parent, Target shall negotiate in good faith
with respect to any changes or modifications to this Agreement which would
allow the Board of Directors of Target not to make such Adverse Recommendation
Change consistent with its fiduciary duties.

  

7.4 _Existing Negotiations._ Immediately after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Target shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their respective Representatives to, cease and terminate any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person heretofore conducted
relating to any possible Acquisition Proposal with respect to it or its
Subsidiaries. Target agrees that it shall take the necessary steps to promptly
inform its Representatives involved in any such activities, discussions or
negotiations, or in the Transactions, of the obligations undertaken in this

_Definitions._ For the purposes of this Agreement: 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or indication of
interest (other than by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries), whether or not in
writing, for the (i) merger, consolidation or other business combination of
Target or any Subsidiary, (ii) a restructuring, recapitalization or
liquidation of Target or any Subsidiary, or (iii) an acquisition or
disposition of any stock or material assets of Target or any Subsidiary.

  

 (b) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Target that was not initiated, solicited or
knowingly facilitated or encouraged in violation of this Agreement, made by a
third party on terms which the

  



   

31

  
       

* * *

     



  

 majority of the Board of Directors of Target determines (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and having received the written
opinion of PI Financial or another independent investment bank of similar
stature in the industry concluding that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a "Superior Proposal" hereunder, a copy of which shall promptly be provided
to Parent) in good faith by resolution duly adopted (i) would result in a
transaction that, if consummated, is more favorable to the shareholders of
Target (in their capacity as shareholders) from a financial point of view,
than the Merger and the other Transactions, taking into account all the terms
and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to
the terms of this Agreement offered by Parent in response to such Superior
Proposal or otherwise), and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed on
the terms proposed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and
other aspects of such proposal; _provided, however,_ that no proposal shall
be deemed to be a Superior Proposal if any financing required to consummate
the proposal is not committed (unless it is reasonable to conclude that the
proposed acquiror has adequate financial resources to consummate
the transaction without such financing).

six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall honor all
rights to indemnification and exculpation existing in favor of a director or

Entity will maintain in effect, for the benefit of the officers and directors
of Target with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing
Date, the existing policy of directors and officers liability insurance

Target to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Surviving Entity may substitute for such existing policy a policy
or policies of comparable coverage; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the

exceed $42,000, then the Surviving Entity shall provide only such coverage as
may be obtained for an aggregate amount equal to $42,000.

  

7.7 _Cooperation_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, from
the Agreement Date until the Effective Time, Target shall confer on a regular
and frequent basis with one or more representatives of Parent to report

operations and each party shall promptly provide the other party or its
counsel with copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions.

  

7.8 _Publicity_. Neither Target, Parent nor any of their respective
affiliates or representatives shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other announcement with respect to the Transactions without
the prior consultation of the other party, except as may be required by
applicable Law, and each party shall use its reasonable efforts to provide
copies of such release or other announcement to the other party hereto, and
give due consideration to such comments as each such other party may have,

inquiries or requests for information received from a Governmental Authority
in relation to such filings or notices for additional information or
documentation and shall cooperate as needed with respect to any such filings
by any other party. Each party agrees to take whatever action may be
necessary to resolve any objection as may be asserted under the HSR
Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor Target shall be
required to accept, as a condition to obtaining any required approval or
resolving any objection of any Governmental Authority, any requirement to
divest or hold separate or in trust (or the imposition of any other material
condition or restriction with respect to) any of the respective businesses or
assets of Parent, Merger Sub, Target or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

  

7.10 _Employee Matters_. All Target Benefit Plans covering employees of
Target and its Subsidiaries will be terminated on or before the Effective

shall resign and, following payment at the Closing of any severance obligation
specifically disclosed in the Target Disclosure Letter and except, in the case
of Targets officers, for the obligations set forth in _Section 7.6_ , the
Surviving Entity shall have no Liability to any such persons following the
Effective Time.

  

7.11 _Target Shareholders  Meeting. _Target shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Agreement Date (i) take all steps reasonably
necessary to call, give notice of, convene and hold a special or annual
meeting of its shareholders (the " _Target Meeting_ ") for the purpose of
securing the Target Shareholders Approval, (ii) distribute to its

of Directors or the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to Target of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Target or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any other fact or circumstance (except for
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article X_ ), this Agreement shall
be submitted to the shareholders of Target at the Target Meeting for the
purpose of adopting this Agreement, with such disclosures as shall be required
by applicable Law.

_Preparation of the F-4 and Proxy Statement/Prospectus._ 

---|---|--- 
  

 (a)  Parent and Target shall each promptly prepare and file with
the SEC a preliminary version of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and each will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC
in connection therewith and to furnish all information required to prepare
the definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each of Parent and Target shall
use its commercially reasonable best efforts to have the F-4 declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such
filing. Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying to
do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or filing
a general consent

applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of the ADSs
in the Merger and Target shall furnish all information concerning Target and
the holders of shares of Target capital stock as may be reasonably requested
in connection with any such action. Promptly after the effectiveness of the
F-4, Target shall cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed
to Targets shareholders, and if necessary, after the definitive
Proxy Statement/Prospectus has been mailed, promptly circulate amended,
supplemented or supplemental proxy materials and, if required in connection
therewith, re-solicit proxies. If at any time prior to the Effective Time,
Parent or Target discover any statement which, in light of the circumstances
under which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to a material
fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statement made
in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus not misleading, then such party shall
immediately notify the other party of such misstatements or omissions. Parent
shall advise Target and Target shall advise Parent, as applicable, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the F-4 becomes effective
or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop
order or that any proceedings for that purpose are pending before or
threatened by the SEC, the suspension of the qualification of the ADSs for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment
of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the F-4 or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information.

  

(b) Target shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be
delivered a letter from its independent auditors, dated (i) the date that is
two business days prior to the effectiveness of the F-4 and (ii) the Closing
Date, and addressed to Parent and its directors, in form and substance
customary for "comfort" letters delivered by independent public accountants in
connection with registration statements similar to the F-4.

  

7.13 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the ADSs to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
listing on the New York Stock Exchange at or prior to the Effective Time,
subject to official notice of issuance.

  

7.14 _Notice of Certain Events_. Target shall give prompt notice to
Parent of any fact, event or circumstance as to which Target obtains knowledge
that would be reasonably likely to result in a failure of a condition set
forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ , _(b)_ or _(c)_. Parent shall give prompt notice to
Target of any fact, event or circumstance as to which Parent obtains knowledge
that would be reasonably likely to result in a failure of a condition set
forth in _Section 8.3(a)_ or _(b)_. Prior to the Closing, Target may deliver
to Parent a supplement or update to the Target Disclosure Letter that
reflects any event, condition or circumstance occurring or arising after the
Agreement Date that is not otherwise prohibited pursuant to this Agreement and
which, in the aggregate taking into account all supplemental disclosures (the
" _Supplemental Disclosures_ ") provided pursuant to this _Section 7.14_ ,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Target, in which case, prior to the Closing, the specified
representations and warranties made by Target will be deemed modified to
reflect such event as of the date that such event occurs or arises for
purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2_ have
been satisfied.

7.15 _Tax Treatment._ Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Merger to qualify, and shall not take, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to prevent any affiliate or shareholder of such party
from taking, any actions that could prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

7.16 _Affiliate Letter._ Prior to the date of the Target Meeting,
Target shall deliver to Parent a list of names and addresses of those Persons
who are, in the opinion of Target, as of the time of the Target Meeting,
"affiliates" of Target within the meaning of Rule 145 under the Securities
Act. Target shall provide to Parent such information and documents as Parent
shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such list. There shall be
added to such list the names and addresses of any other Person subsequently
identified by either Parent or Target as a Person who may be deemed to be such
an affiliate of Target. Target shall exercise its commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, prior to the date of
the Target Meeting, from each affiliate of Target identified in the foregoing
list (as the same may be supplemented as aforesaid), a letter dated as of the
Closing Date substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit B_ (the "
_Affiliate Letter_ "). Parent shall not be required to maintain the
effectiveness of the F-4 or any other registration statement under the
Securities Act for the purposes of resale by such affiliates of ADSs received
pursuant to the Merger and Parent may direct the Exchange Agent not to issue
certificates representing ADSs to any such affiliate until Parent has received
from such Person an Affiliate Letter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
_Section 7.16_ shall have no effect if Rule 145(c) under the Securities Act no
longer deems "affiliates" of Target within the meaning of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act to be "underwriters" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of
the Securities Act.

  

7.17 _Joint Venture Transaction_. During the period commencing on the
Agreement Date and ending on the 90th day following the Closing Date, none of
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
shall, directly or indirectly, participate or engage in discussions or
negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information regarding Target or
the Joint Venture or afford access to the properties, books or records of
Target or the Joint Venture to, any Person that has made an offer to purchase
all or substantially all of the capital stock or assets of Target or the Joint
Venture (" _Target_ _Proposal_ ") or to any Person that Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives knows or has reason
to believe is contemplating making a Target Proposal.
