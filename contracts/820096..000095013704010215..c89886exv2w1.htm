stock of the Company owned by him, to vote or deliver written consents with
respect to all such shares in favor of approval of this Agreement and the

written consents with respect to all such shares against any transaction that
is reasonably likely to impair the ability of Buyer, Merger Sub or the
Company to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Merger); and (ii) a Lock-Up Agreement (the "Lock-Up Agreement") with the
Principal Shareholder pursuant to which the Principal Shareholder has agreed
to certain restrictions with respect to the sale or other disposition

Merger;   

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a condition and inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement, the Company is entering into a Voting Agreement (the "Buyer Voting Agreement") with a certain shareholder of Buyer (the "Buyer Shareholder") pursuant to which, among other things, such Buyer Shareholder has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions therein, to vote or deliver written consents with respect to all shares of capital stock of Buyer owned by such shareholder in favor of approval of the issuance of the Buyer Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement; and   

 WHEREAS, Buyer intends to operate the Surviving Corporations business in Israel in substantially the same manner as the business has been operated by the Company in the past.   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the mutual covenants, promises and representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:   

ARTICLE I 
 PLAN OF MERGER    

 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law, at the Effective Time (as defined herein), Merger Sub (as the target company (Chevrat Yaad) in the Merger) shall be merged with and into the Company (as the absorbing company (Chevra Koletet) in the Merger). As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall (a) become a wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary of Buyer, (b) be governed by the laws of the State of Israel, (c) maintain a registered office in the State of Israel and (d) succeed to and assume all of the rights, properties and obligations of Merger Sub and the Company in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law. Buyer, as the sole direct or indirect shareholder of Merger Sub, shall approve or    ##### 

  

   

cause to be approved the Merger and this Agreement at the general
shareholders meeting of Merger Sub as promptly as practicable following the
execution hereof.   

 1.2 Effective Time; Closing Date. The closing of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, 101 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10178, at a time and on a date to be designated by the parties (the time and date upon which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the fifth business day after the later to occur of: (a) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied or waived as of the Closing); or (b) the 71st day after the delivery of the Merger Proposal (as defined herein) to the office of the Companies Registrar of the State of Israel (the "Companies Registrar"), or at such other time, date and location as the parties hereto shall mutually agree. On or before the Closing Date, Merger Sub and the Company shall each, in coordination with each other, deliver to the Companies Registrar a notice (the "Merger Notice") informing the Companies Registrar that the Merger was approved by the general shareholders meetings of Merger Sub and the Company, respectively. The Merger shall become effective upon the issuance by the Companies Registrar of a certificate evidencing the completion of the Merger in accordance with section 323(5) of the Israeli Companies Law. The time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein as the "Effective Time".   

 1.3 Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time, without any action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities, the following shall occur:   

 (a) Conversion of Company Shares. Each Ordinary Share, NIS 1.00 par value per share, of the Company (collectively, the "Company Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Company Shares held in the treasury of the Company or owned by Buyer or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall automatically be converted into and represent the right to receive the following (the "Merger Consideration"): (i) 0.8011 shares of common stock, without par value, of Buyer (the "Buyer Common Stock"); and (ii) $14.93 in cash, in each case payable without interest to the holder of such Company Share upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 1.4, of the certificate that formerly evidenced such Company Share. Upon the issuance of any Buyer Common Stock hereunder, and pursuant to Buyers existing Rights Agreement dated as of April 10, 1996 (as the same may be amended from time to time, the "Rights Agreement") between Buyer and State Street Bank and Trust Company, as rights agent, one Preferred Share Purchase Right issuable pursuant to the Rights Agreement or any other right issued in substitution therefor (a "Right") shall be issued together with and shall attach to each share of Buyer Common Stock issued pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, unless the Rights shall have expired or been redeemed prior to the Effective Time. References in this Agreement to Buyer Common Stock shall include, unless the context requires otherwise, the Rights.    ##### 

  

  

 (b) Buyer-Owned Stock and Stock Held in Treasury. Each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned by Buyer or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or of Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired without any conversion or consideration paid in respect thereof, and shall cease to exist.   

 (c) Stock Options. Effective as of the Effective Time, each outstanding option or right to acquire Company Shares then outstanding (each, a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not then exercisable, shall be assumed by Buyer and converted into an option to purchase shares of Buyer Common Stock in accordance with this Section 1.3(c). Each Company Stock Option so converted shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same material terms and conditions (including vesting schedule) as set forth in the applicable agreement pursuant to which such Company Stock Option was granted immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that, as of the Effective Time, (i) each Company Stock Option shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the product of the number of Company Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by 1.6022 (the "Exchange Ratio"), rounded to the nearest whole number of shares of Buyer Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price for each share of Buyer Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Company Stock Option so converted shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per Company Share at which such Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time (expressed in U.S. Dollars based on the exchange rate in effect as of the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the date hereof) by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole cent. If not otherwise covered by a registration statement on Form S-8 in place as of the Effective Time, then as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 60 days after the Closing, Buyer shall register the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Company Stock Option converted pursuant to this Section 1.3(c) by filing an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another appropriate form with the SEC (as defined herein), and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and maintain the current status of the prospectus with respect thereto for so long as such options remain outstanding. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any and all consents necessary to allow for the conversion of the Company Stock Options as provided in this Section 1.3(c).   

 (d) Articles of Association. At the Effective Time, the Articles of Association of the Company shall be the Articles of Association of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law and such Articles of Association.   

 (e) Directors and Officers. The initial directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub    ##### 

  

   

immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance
with the Articles of Association of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are duly appointed.   

 (f) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each Ordinary Share, NIS 1.00 par value per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Ordinary Share, NIS 1.00 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, evidence ownership of such shares of the Surviving Corporation.   

 (g) Adjustments to Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any forward or reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into Buyer Common Stock or Company Shares), cash dividends (other than any regular quarterly Buyer dividend of no more than $0.04 per share of Buyer Common Stock), stock issuance or sale, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Buyer Common Stock or Company Shares occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.   

 (h) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock will be issued to represent any fractional share interests in Buyer Common Stock to be delivered hereunder in exchange for Company Shares, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Shares who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender by such holder of each Certificate (as defined herein) held thereby, receive from Buyer an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) $18.638. The parties hereto acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately bargained for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting complexities that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.   

 1.4 Surrender of Certificates.   

 (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall appoint a bank or trust company that maintains an office in Israel reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the exchange of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented issued and outstanding Company Shares that were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.3 (the "Certificates").   

 (b) Buyer to Provide Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for exchange in    ##### 

  

   

accordance with this Article I, the Merger Consideration and cash in an
amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common
Stock to which holders of Company Shares may be entitled pursuant to Section
1.3(h) and any dividends or distributions to which holders of Company Shares
may be entitled pursuant to Section 1.4(d) (collectively, the "Exchange
Fund"). In the event the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to
fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent
hereunder (including pursuant to Section 1.3(h) and 1.4(d)), Buyer shall
promptly make available to the Exchange Agent the amounts so required to
satisfy such payment obligations in full. The Exchange Agent shall deliver
the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Buyer
Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions contemplated to be paid
for Company Shares pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund.
Except as contemplated by this Section 1.4, the Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose.   

 (c) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later than three business days thereafter), Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record as of the Effective Time of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (in the English and Hebrew languages) in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate to the Exchange Agent), that shall also be in such form and have such other provisions as Buyer and the Company may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions (in the English and Hebrew languages) for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.4(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive, upon surrender and without interest, the Merger Consideration into which the Company Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to Section 1.3, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.4(d).   

 (d) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date hereof with respect to Buyer Common Stock with a record date at or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Buyer Common Stock represented thereby until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.4. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver to the record holder thereof, without interest, certificates representing whole shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in exchange therefor along with payment of the amount of cash, if any, into which the aggregate number of Company Shares previously represented by such certificate surrendered shall    ##### 

  

   

have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.3(h) and the amount of any such
dividends or other distributions with a record date at or after the Effective
Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Buyer Common
Stock.   

 (e) Transfers of Ownership. If certificates representing shares of Buyer Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the persons requesting such exchange will have paid to Buyer or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes (as defined herein) required by reason of the issuance of certificates representing shares of Buyer Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Buyer or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.   

 (f) Required Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent and Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Shares such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom (i) if and to the extent required under the Israeli Tax Ordinance and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the Israeli Income Tax Ruling (as defined herein) or any other provision of Israeli law, statute, regulation, administrative ruling, pronouncement or other authority or judicial opinion or (ii) if required under section 3401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any similar provision of United States federal, state or local or foreign Tax Law, but only to the extent that any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement is treated as compensation for services. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.   

 (g) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.4, neither the Exchange Agent, Buyer nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Buyer Common Stock or Company Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   

 1.5 Companys Transfer Books Closed; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares. At the Effective Time: (a) the share transfer books of the Company shall be deemed closed, and no transfer of any certificates theretofore representing Company Shares shall thereafter be made or consummated; and (b) all holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company except for any right to receive the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.4(d). All shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.3(h) or    ##### 

  

   

1.4(d)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Company Shares.   

 1.6 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Buyer or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Buyer or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against them with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration into which the Company Shares represented by such Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have been converted pursuant to Section 1.3, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock payable to the holder thereof pursuant to Section 1.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions payable to the holder thereof pursuant to Section 1.4(d).   

 1.7 Termination of Exchange Fund. Promptly following the date that is 180 days after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to Buyer any portion of the Exchange Fund which has not been disbursed to holders of Company Shares (including all interest and other income received by the Exchange Agent in respect of the Exchange Fund), and thereafter each holder of a Certificate may surrender such Certificate to Buyer or the Surviving Corporation and (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) receive in consideration therefor the Merger Consideration into which the Company Shares represented by such Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have been converted pursuant to Section 1.3, without interest, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.4(d), but such holder shall have no greater rights against Buyer or the Surviving Corporation than may be accorded to general creditors of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation under applicable law.   

 1.8 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after the Closing Date, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, the officers and directors of the Company, Merger Sub and Buyer will take any and all such lawful and necessary action.   

ARTICLE II 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY    

 The Company represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:   

 2.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.   

 (a) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (as defined herein) is a corporation duly organized and validly existing and, where such concept is applicable, in good standing, under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the    ##### 

  

   

failure to be in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined herein)
on the Company. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is in
possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders ("Approvals")
necessary to own, lease and operate the properties it purports to own,
operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
except where the failure to have such Approvals would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and, where
such concept is applicable, is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where
the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature
of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except
where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. For the purposes of this Agreement,
"Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to any party hereto, any event,
change, circumstance or state of facts which individually or in the aggregate
has or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
business, assets, liabilities, properties, condition (financial or otherwise)
or results of operations of such party and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, materially impair the ability of such party to perform any of its
obligations hereunder or prevent or materially delay the consummation of any
of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the
term "Material Adverse Effect" shall exclude events, changes, circumstances
and states of facts (i) that result or arise from events, changes,
circumstances or states of facts generally affecting any industry in which
such party operates or the economy in any of the countries in which such
party operates, (ii) that result or arise from events, changes, circumstances
or states of facts affecting general worldwide economic or capital market
conditions, which in the case of each of the immediately preceding clause (i)
and this clause (ii) do not materially disproportionately affect such party,
(iii) specifically related to the results of pre-clinical and clinical
testing (including bioequivalence testing), United States Food and Drug
Administration ("FDA") review of regulatory submissions (except to the extent
that review issues relate to general FDA compliance considerations, such as
compliance with good manufacturing practice requirements), including the
approval by the FDA of any products of any third party that are competitive
with products of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and patent litigation
for drugs that are pending or planned to be submitted for approval under
abbreviated new drug applications or section 505(b)(2) applications, or (iv)
that result or arise from the execution of this Agreement or the announcement
of the transactions contemplated hereby.   

 (b) Section 2.1(b) of that certain Schedule dated as of the date hereof, signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company and delivered to Buyer on the date hereof (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), lists each of the Companys subsidiaries (each, a "Company Subsidiary" and, collectively, the "Company Subsidiaries"), the jurisdiction of incorporation of each Company Subsidiary and the Companys equity interest therein, and, if not directly or indirectly wholly owned by the Company, to the Knowledge (as defined herein) of the Company, the identity and ownership interest of each of the other owners of such Company Subsidiary. Except as set forth in Section    ##### 

  

   

2.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has agreed, is obligated to make or is
bound (or has bound its property) by any written or oral agreement, contract,
subcontract, lease, binding understanding, instrument, note, option,
warranty, purchase order, license, sublicense, insurance policy, benefit
plan, commitment, arrangement or undertaking of any nature under applicable
law (a "Contract") under which it is or is reasonably likely to become
obligated to make any future investment in or capital contribution to any
other entity in excess of $100,000 in the aggregate with other such
Contracts. Other than the Companys interests in the Company Subsidiaries,
and except as set forth in Section 2.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary directly or indirectly owns
any equity or similar interest in or any interest convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in,
any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
trust, association, unincorporated organization or other legal entity. All of
the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of or other equity
interests in each Company Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive
rights, and, except as set forth in Section 2.1(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, all such shares or interests owned by the Company or any Company

Except as set forth in Section 2.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of the Company Charter Documents, and no Company Subsidiary is in violation of its applicable Company Subsidiary Charter Documents.    ##### 

  

  

 2.2 Capitalization.   

 (a) The registered (authorized) share capital of the Company consists of 40,000,000 Company Shares, NIS 1.00 par value per share. As of the date hereof: (i) 31,326,116 Company Shares are issued and outstanding; (ii) except as set forth in Section 2.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no Company Shares are held in treasury by the Company or any Company Subsidiary; and (iii) 75,000 Company Shares are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options or the grant of the rights to purchase Company Shares.   

 (b) All issued and outstanding Company Shares are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are not subject to preemptive rights. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible or exercisable or exchangeable for securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which shareholders of the Company may vote.   

 (c) Section 2.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the following information with respect to each Company Stock Option outstanding as of the date of this Agreement: (i) the name of the optionee; (ii) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Stock Option; (iii) the exercise price of such Company Stock Option; (iv) the date on which such Company Stock Option was granted; and (v) the applicable vesting schedule, including the vesting commencement date.

All Company Shares subject to issuance have been duly authorized and, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the instrument pursuant to which they are issuable, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except as set forth in Section 2.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no commitments, agreements or understandings of any character to which the Company is bound obligating the Company to accelerate the vesting of any Company Stock Option as a result of the Merger. All outstanding Company Shares, all outstanding Company Stock Options, and all outstanding shares of capital stock of each Company Subsidiary have been issued and granted in compliance with (i) all laws applicable to the issuance of securities or stock options, and (ii) all requirements set forth in applicable Contracts, except where the failure to comply with any such requirements would not, individually, or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   

 (d) Except (i) as set forth in Section 2.2(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (ii) for securities that the Company owns free and clear of all Liens, options, rights of first refusal, preemptive rights, community property interests or restrictions of any nature (including any restriction on the voting of any security, any restriction on the transfer of any security or other asset, any restriction on the possession, exercise or transfer of any other attribute of ownership of any asset, but specifically excluding any restrictions under applicable securities laws) directly or indirectly through one or more Company Subsidiaries, and (iii) for shares of capital stock or other similar ownership    #####

required, in such other manner (including in a popular newspaper in the
United States) as may be required by applicable Law; (ii) within four
business days from the date of submitting the Merger Proposal to the
Companies Registrar, send a notice by registered mail to all of

Buyer and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to secure the consent of Israeli Lands Authority to the Merger, provided, that such efforts shall not require Buyer or the Company to make any payment (other than filing, processing or similar administrative fees that are not material in amount) in order to obtain such consent.   

 (b) Israeli Income Tax Ruling. As soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company, Buyer and Merger Sub shall cause their respective Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants to prepare and file with the Israeli Income Tax Commissioner an application for a ruling concerning the Israeli Tax treatment of the Merger and that will include specific arrangements concerning withholding Taxes under which Buyer will not be obligated to withhold any Taxes with respect to the Buyer Common Stock, and that will not impose any obligations on the Company, Buyer or its shareholders without Buyers prior written consent (the "Israeli Income Tax Ruling"). Each of the Company and Buyer shall cause its respective Israeli counsel to coordinate all activities, and to cooperate with each other, with respect to the preparation and filing of such application and in the preparation of any written or oral submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Israeli Income Tax Ruling. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Company and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to obtain the Israeli Income Tax Rulings as promptly as practicable. Notwithstanding any provisions contained in Section 4.1 to the contrary, the Company shall be permitted to comply with any conditions contained in the ruling described in this Section 5.4(b) or reasonable requests made by the Israeli Tax Commissioner in connection with its delivery of such ruling; provided, however, (i) that the Company shall give Buyer at least three days written notice of any such conditions or requests prior to compliance with such conditions or requests, and (ii) that in no event, unless consented to by Buyer, shall the    ##### 

  

   

Company comply with any such condition or request in the event any such
condition or request might reasonably be expected to (A) have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, (B) prohibit or impair any business practice
of the Company, any acquisition of property by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or the conduct of business by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or (C) adversely impact or delay the consummation of the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

 (c) TASE Listing. Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall take all actions necessary in order for the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be listed on the TASE immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to the Closing Date, the agreement of the TASE to list such shares of Buyer Common Stock on the TASE, and the Company shall cooperate with Buyer with respect to such listing. Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the listing of shares of Buyer Common Stock on the TASE (or any successor thereof) and to comply, in all material respects, with any applicable rules and regulations of the ISA and TASE until the date which is at least three years after the Effective Time.   

 5.5 Confidentiality; Access to Information. The parties acknowledge that the Company and Buyer have previously executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated as of October 30, 2003 (the "Non-Disclosure Agreement"), which Non-Disclosure Agreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms except as otherwise provided herein, and Buyer shall cause Merger Sub to comply with the terms thereof. Each of Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company will afford the other parties and the other parties accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to its properties, books, records and personnel during the period prior to the Effective Time to obtain all information concerning its business, including without limitation the status of product development efforts, properties, results of operations and personnel, as the other may reasonably request. The Company shall provide to Buyer the monthly balance sheets, statements of operations, retained earnings and cash flows and other financial statements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries generated by the Company in the ordinary course as such became available. Each of the parties hereto will hold, and will cause its accountants, counsel and other representatives to hold, in confidence all documents and information furnished to it by or on behalf of another party to this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement. No information or knowledge obtained by a party in any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.5 will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.   

 5.6 No Solicitation.   

 (a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective officers, directors, employees, auditors, financial advisors,    ##### 

  

   

attorneys, accountants, consultants and other agents, advisors
or representatives (collectively, "Representatives") not to, directly
or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or knowingly
facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or the
making or submission of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate or engage in
any discussions (except to notify of the existence of these provisions) or
negotiations with, or disclose or provide any non-public information or data
relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or afford access to the
properties, books or records or employees of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries to, any third party relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or
knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an
Acquisition Proposal or accept an Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into
any Contract (including any agreement in principle, letter of intent or
understanding, but excluding a non-disclosure agreement of the type described
in, and subject to compliance by the Company with, Section 5.6(b)) with
respect to or contemplating any Acquisition Proposal or enter into any
agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries respective Representatives
to, immediately cease and terminate any existing solicitation, initiation,
encouragement, activity, discussion or negotiation with any third party
conducted heretofore by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or their
respective Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.   

 (b) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in Section 5.6(a), if, at any time prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written proposal from a third party relating to an Acquisition Proposal (under circumstances in which the Company has complied with its obligations under Section 5.6(a), other than any breach of such obligations that is unintentional and immaterial) and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith that (A) such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal (as defined herein), and (B) the failure to provide nonpublic information or data concerning the Company or participate in negotiations or discussions concerning such Acquisition Proposal would result in a breach by the Board of Directors of the Company of its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under applicable Law, then, with respect to each of the immediately preceding clauses (A) and (B), after consultation with a financial advisor of internationally recognized reputation and after consultation with its outside counsel and an additional law firm with expertise in corporate transactions in the State of Israel, the Company may, subject to its giving Buyer at least three business days prior written notice of the identity of such third party and the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and the Companys intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such third party, (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and afford access to the properties, books or records or employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to such third party pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement containing terms no less restrictive than the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement and a customary standstill provision, provided that a copy of all such information is delivered    ##### 

  

   

simultaneously to Buyer if it has not previously been so furnished to Buyer,
and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding
such proposal.   

 (c) The Company shall as soon as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) notify and advise Buyer orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal or of any request for information or inquiry that may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including without limitation price, structure, form of consideration and financing status), request or inquiry, and the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall inform Buyer on a prompt and current basis of the status, material content and material details of any discussions regarding, or relating to, any Acquisition Proposal with a third party (including amendments and proposed amendments) and, as promptly as practicable, of any change in the price, structure or form of the consideration or material terms of and conditions regarding the Acquisition Proposal. In fulfilling its obligations under this Section 5.6(c), the Company shall provide promptly to Buyer copies of all material written correspondence or other material written material, including material in electronic form, between the Company and such third party.   

 (d) The Company shall promptly inform its and the Company Subsidiaries respective Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.6.   

 (e) For the purposes of this Agreement:   

 (i) "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any inquiry, offer, proposal, indication of interest, signed agreement or public announcement, as the case may be, by any third party that relates to (A) any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation or other direct or indirect business combination involving the Company or any transaction or series of transactions involving the issuance or acquisition of shares of capital stock or other equity securities of the Company representing 15% or more (by voting power) of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, (B) any tender or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person, together with all affiliates thereof, beneficially owning (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) shares of capital stock or other equity securities of the Company representing 15% or more (by voting power) of the outstanding capital stock of the Company or (C) the acquisition, license, purchase or other disposition of 15% or more of the consolidated business or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (including the capital stock or assets of any Company Subsidiary) outside the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; and   

 (ii) "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (provided, that for the purposes of this definition, (A) the applicable percentages in clauses (A) and (B) of the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be 50% as opposed to 15% and (B) any acquisition, license, purchase or other disposition referred to in clause (C) of the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be for all or a majority of the consolidated business and assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (including the capital stock or assets of any Company    ##### 

  

   

Subsidiary), the consideration for which consists entirely of (i) cash, (ii)
freely tradable (subject to customary prospectus delivery requirements and
restrictions based solely on the identity of the recipient of the securities
in such transaction) securities which have an average daily trading volume
(measured during the most recently completed three-month period prior to the
date on which such Acquisition Proposal is made) that is equal to or greater
than that of Buyers Common Stock (measured during the most
recently completed three-month period prior to the date hereof), or (iii)
some combination thereof, on its most recently amended or modified terms, if
amended or modified, which the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of
internationally recognized reputation and after consultation with the
Companys outside counsel), taking into account, among other things, all
legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of the proposal and
the third party making the proposal including but not limited to the fact
that if any cash consideration is involved, the proposal is not subject to
any financing contingency and that receipt of all governmental and regulatory
approvals required to consummate the Acquisition Proposal is likely, (1)
would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable to the
Companys shareholders (in their capacities as shareholders), from a
financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (2) is reasonably capable of being completed.   

 (f) The Company agrees not to release or permit the release of any person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality (other than those entered into in the ordinary course of business), "standstill" or similar agreement to which any of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party (except that the Company shall be permitted to release or permit the release of such person from any standstill obligation if such action is required in order for the Companys Board of Directors to exercise its rights under, and consistent with, Sections 5.6(b) and 5.7(b)) and will promptly provide Buyer with a copy of such agreements. The Company will use its best efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced each such agreement at the request of Buyer.   

 5.7 Board Recommendation.   

 (a) Subject to Section 5.7(b), neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify, modify or amend (or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify, modify or amend) in any manner adverse to Buyer, the Company Recommendation or take any action or make any statement, filing or release, in connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the Company Recommendation (it being understood that taking a neutral position or no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall each be considered an adverse modification of the Company Recommendation) or (ii) approve or recommend (or propose publicly to approve or recommend) any Acquisition Proposal (each of the foregoing is referred to herein as a "Company Change in Recommendation").   

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.7(a), if, prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that the failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation would result    ##### 

  

   

in a breach by the Board of Directors of the Company of its fiduciary duties
to the Companys shareholders under applicable Law, and (i) the Board of
Directors of the Company has consulted with its outside counsel and an
additional law firm with expertise in corporate transactions in the State of
Israel and (ii) if such determination is based on the value of the Merger
Consideration but is not being made in connection with a Superior Proposal,
the Board of Directors of the Company has consulted with a financial advisor
of internationally recognized reputation with regard to, among other things,
the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration as
of the date of such determination to the holders of Company Shares, then the
Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company Change
in Recommendation. In addition to the foregoing requirements, in the event of
a Company Change in Recommendation resulting from a Superior Proposal, the
Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company Change in Recommendation
only (i) after the Company provides to Buyer a written notice (a "Notice of
Superior Proposal") (A) advising Buyer that the Board of Directors of the
Company has received, and intends to accept, a Superior Proposal, (B)
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal,
including the amount that the Companys shareholders will receive per Company
Share (valuing any non-cash consideration at what the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent
financial advisor, to be the fair value of such non-cash consideration) and
including a copy thereof with all accompanying documentation, and (C)
identifying the person making such Superior Proposal, (ii) after cooperating
in good faith with Buyer for a period of not less than five business days to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
enable the Company to proceed with the Company Recommendation without a
Company Change in Recommendation (provided, however, that any determination
by Buyer to propose to make such adjustment to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement shall be at the discretion of Buyer at the time), and (iii) if
Buyer does not, within five business days of Buyers receipt of the Notice of
Superior Proposal, make an offer that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) to be as favorable to the Companys
shareholders as such Superior Proposal.   

 (c) Neither the Board of Directors of Buyer nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, qualify, modify or amend (or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify, modify or amend) in any manner adverse to the Company, the Buyer Recommendation or make any statement, filing or release, in connection with the Buyer Shareholders Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the Buyer Recommendation (it being understood that taking a neutral position or no position shall each be considered an adverse modification of the Buyer Recommendation) (each of the foregoing is referred to herein as a "Buyer Change in Recommendation").   

 5.8 Public Disclosure. Except for the joint announcement of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the timing and content of which have been mutually agreed by the parties hereto, no party hereto shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public announcement with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or an Acquisition Proposal without first consulting with the other parties and providing the other parties with reasonable opportunity to review    ##### 

  

   

and comment upon such press release or public announcement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if such an announcement is required by applicable law or any
listing agreement with a national securities exchange or quotation system
(including Nasdaq and the TASE) the party required to make such announcement
shall provide notice to and a copy of such as promptly as practicable in
advance of such announcement and, to the extent practicable, take the views
of the other party in respect of such announcement into account prior to
making such announcement. The parties hereto have agreed to the text of the
joint press release announcing the execution and delivery of this
Agreement.   

 5.9 Commercially Reasonable Efforts.   

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things under such partys control or which such party is required to do under this Agreement to consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions hereby, use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.   

 (b) Each of the parties hereto shall, (i) as promptly as practicable and before the expiration of any relevant legal deadline, but in no event later than fifteen business days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the notification and report form required for the transactions contemplated hereby and any supplemental information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act, which forms shall specifically request early termination of the waiting period prescribed by the HSR Act, and (ii) as promptly as practicable and before the expiration of any legal deadline, file with any other Governmental Entity, any other filings, reports, information and documentation required for the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to any other antitrust, competition or trade regulatory law of any Governmental Entity (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"). Each of the parties hereto shall furnish to each others counsel such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws.   

 (c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain promptly any clearance required under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws for the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC and the DOJ and other Governmental Entities and shall comply promptly with any    ##### 

  

   

such inquiry or request; provided, however, that neither Buyer nor any
affiliate thereof shall be required to consent to any divestiture or any
other structural or conduct relief. Each of the parties hereto shall promptly
and timely respond to a request for additional information from the DOJ or
the FTC.   

 (d) Each of the parties hereto commits to instruct its counsel to cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate and expedite the identification and resolution of any such issues and, consequently, the expiration of the applicable HSR Act waiting period and the waiting periods under any other Antitrust Laws at the earliest practicable dates. Such commercially reasonable efforts and cooperation include, without limitation, counsels undertaking (i) to keep each other appropriately informed of communications from and to personnel of the reviewing antitrust authority, and (ii) to confer with each other regarding appropriate contacts with and response to personnel of such antitrust authority.   

 (e) Each party hereto shall (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the commencement of any legal or other proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity (including the Israeli Restrictive Trade Practices Commissioner, the OCS, the Investment Center, the ISA, the Companies Registrar, the Israeli Lands Authority, the FTC, the DOJ and the SEC) with respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) promptly inform the other parties of any communication with any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any such proceeding or communication. The parties to this Agreement will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any analysis, appearance, discussion, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with any proceeding or communication relating to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any legal requirement, in connection with any such proceeding relating to any such Governmental Entity, each party hereto will permit authorized representatives of the other party to be present at each meeting or conference or telephone call relating to any such proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with any such proceeding.   

 5.10 Indemnification.   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless all current and former directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the fullest extent permitted by Law for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (including without limitation acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) in their capacities as such. Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and its directors and officers in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, any indemnification provisions under the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the    ##### 

  

   

date hereof and the indemnification resolutions adopted by the shareholders
of the Company on November 12, 1992, in each case to the maximum extent
permitted by Law.   

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will endeavor to enter into a directors and officers liability insurance policy covering those persons who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, are covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (the "Insured Parties") on terms no less favorable to the Insured Parties than those of the Companys present directors and officers liability insurance policy (such policy, a "Company DandO Policy"), for a period of seven years after the Effective Time, at a cost not to exceed $700,000. If the Company is unable to obtain such a Company DandO Policy prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, for a period of seven years after the Closing Date, a Company DandO Policy; provided, however, that in no event shall Buyer be required to expend annually more than 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage (and if the cost for such coverage is in excess of such amount Buyer shall be required only to maintain such coverage as is available for such amount).   

 (c) In the event that Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any person, Buyer shall cause proper provisions to be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10. The obligations of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.10 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 5.10 applies without the express written consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 5.10 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.10).   

 5.11 Company Affiliate Agreement. As soon as practicable after the date hereof and in any event not fewer than 30 days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a list setting forth the names of all persons the Company expects to be, as of the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting, its "affiliates" for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the delivery to Buyer of letter agreements in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto from each person identified in the list delivered by the Company pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.    ##### 

  

  

 5.12 Nasdaq Listing. Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing upon the Effective Time on Nasdaq or on such other national securities exchange as the Buyer Common Stock is listed.   

 5.13 Employee Matters.   

 (a) Following the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all Company Employee Plans and Company Employment Agreements disclosed herein in accordance with their respective terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. It is the intention of Buyer to, immediately following the Effective Time, continue the employment of Company Employees who are employed by the Company and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Post-Merger Employees"). Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide Post-Merger Employees whose employment is continued by the Surviving Corporation, for a period of one year following the Effective Time, with compensation and benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.   

 (b) To the extent permitted by Law and the terms of any employee benefit plan or arrangements maintained by Buyer or any subsidiary of Buyer in which a Post-Merger Employee becomes eligible to participate (other than equity-based compensation plans) (the "Post-Merger Plans"), Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, give Post-Merger Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and amount of benefits under Post-Merger Plans in which such Post-Merger Employee becomes eligible to participate in after the Closing Date; provided, however, that in no event shall the Post-Merger Employee be entitled to any credit to the extent that it would result in duplication of benefits.   

 (c) Buyer Restricted Stock. As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall grant to selected Post-Merger Employees shares of Buyer Common Stock (the "Buyer Restricted Stock") having an aggregate value, based on the closing price of Buyer Common Stock on the business day immediately preceding the Closing Date, of $4,100,000. The Buyer Restricted Stock shall be granted pursuant to and subject to the terms of the LTIP and, subject to the continued employment of the Post-Merger Employee, shall vest in three annual installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the Closing Date (each such date, a "Vesting Date"); provided, however, that if on or prior to the final Vesting Date, (i) the Post-Merger Employees employment is terminated by the Company (other than for cause) or (ii) if the Post-Merger Employee terminates his or her employment for "good reason" (as defined herein), then notwithstanding anything in the LTIP to the contrary all unvested Buyer Restricted Stock awarded to such Post-Merger Employee shall vest immediately upon such termination of employment. For the purposes of this Agreement, "good reason" means a reduction in such Post-Merger Employees annual base salary or the relocation of such Post-Merger Employees principal place of employment to a location more than 50 miles from such Post-Merger Employees principal place of employment immediately prior to the Effective Time.    ##### 

  

  

 (d) Special Bonuses. On the Closing Date, the Company may distribute bonuses to selected Post-Merger Employees in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2,750,000 (collectively, the "Special Bonuses"); provided, however, that the aggregate amount of Special Bonuses shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of bonuses set forth next to the names of the individuals set forth on Section 5.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.   

 (e) Retention Agreements. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may enter into retention agreements, in substantially the form made available to Buyer prior to the date hereof, with selected Company Employees (the "Retention Agreements") providing for payments to such Company Employees generally no earlier than six months, and no later than three years, following the Closing date, subject to continued employment through the payment date; provided, however, that the aggregate payments under the Retention Agreements shall in no event exceed $1,750,000.   

 (f) Mutual Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, the chief executive officers of each of Buyer and the Company shall mutually agree upon the selection of Post-Merger Employees who are eligible for Buyer Restricted Stock, Special Bonuses and Retention Payments (which employees may include the Companys three most senior executives), the apportionment of the Buyer Restricted Stock, Special Bonuses and Retention Payments, and the timing of the Retention Payments; provided, however, that shares of Buyer Restricted Stock having an aggregate value as determined in accordance with Section 5.13(c) of $1,000,000 and Special Bonuses in the aggregate amount of $1,000,000 shall not be subject to such mutual agreement and shall instead be apportioned to Post-Merger Employees as determined by the Company.   

 (g) To the extent not paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to distribute annual bonuses with respect to 2004 to eligible Post-Merger Employees, at times and in such amounts to be determined in accordance with past practice of the Company as determined by the chief executive officer of the Company or his designee.   

 (h) Nothing in this Section 5.13, express or implied, shall confer upon any Company Employee, or any legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 5.13, express or implied, shall be construed to prevent the Buyer from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any benefit plan that the Buyer may establish or maintain.   

 5.14 Section 16 Matters. Buyer and the Company agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain the Company Insiders (as defined herein) in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that the conversion of Shares into shares of Buyer Common Stock in the Merger by the Company Insiders be exempted from liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 5.14. Assuming that the Company delivers to Buyer the    ##### 

  

   

Section 16 Information in a timely fashion, the Board of Directors of Buyer,
or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution
providing that the receipt by the Company Insiders of Buyer Common Stock in
exchange for Company Shares pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16
Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to
Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act. For the purposes of this Agreement:
"Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate in all material
respects regarding the Company Insiders, the number of Shares held by each
such Company Insider and elected by such Company Insiders to be exchanged for
Buyer Common Stock in the Merger; and "Company Insiders" shall mean those
officers and directors of the Company who may be subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act on or following the
Effective Time and who are listed in the Section 16 Information.   

 5.15 Resignations. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain resignations from the directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries designated by Buyer from their positions as directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries effective as of the Effective Time.

 6.2 Additional Conditions to Obligations of the Company.

 (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Boards of Directors of Buyer and the Company;   

 (b) by either the Company or Buyer if the Merger shall not have been consummated prior to August 31, 2005 (the "Termination Date") for any reason; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date;    #####

 (g) By the Company, if any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.2 shall have become incapable of fulfillment by the Termination Date and shall not have been waived by the Company;

 Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1 shall not be available to any party that (i) is in material breach of its obligations hereunder or (ii) whose failure to fulfill its obligations or to comply with its covenants under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure to satisfy any condition to the obligations of any party hereunder.

A party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), or (i) shall give written notice of such termination to the other party, specifying the provision pursuant to which such termination is effective. In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force and effect, except (i) as set forth in this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article VIII, each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in the Non-Disclosure Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.   

 7.3 Fees and Expenses.   

 (a) Other than as specifically provided in this Section 7.3 or otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that (i) filing fees in connection with the filing with the SEC of the Form S-4 Registration Statement and the Prospectus, (ii) filing fees payable under or pursuant to the HSR Act, (iii) all printing, mailing and related expenses incurred in connection with printing and mailing of the Form S-4 Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and (iv) any filing fees in connection with filings with any Israeli Governmental Entity shall be shared equally by Buyer and the Company, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

 (i) Section 7.1(e) prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting or 7.1(j); or    

 (ii) Section 7.1(d)(i), and (A) after the date hereof and prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting at which the Company failed to obtain the requisite vote there shall be outstanding or there shall have been publicly announced a plan or proposal with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and (B)(1) within 12 months after such   ##### 

  

   

termination the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal (substituting "20%" for "15%" in the
definition thereof) or (2) within six months after such termination the
Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any
transaction or series of transactions which, had such been proposed during
the term of this Agreement, would have constituted an Acquisition Proposal
(substituting "50%" for "15%" in the definition thereof), provided that the
transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Proposal described in the
immediately preceding clause (1) or (2), as applicable, are subsequently
consummated; or   

 (iii) Section 7.1(b), to the extent resulting from a material breach by the Company, or Section 7.1(f), to the extent terminated by Buyer, and, in any such case, (A) after the date hereof and prior to or at the time of such termination, there shall be outstanding, there shall have been under consideration by the Company or there shall have been publicly announced a plan or proposal with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and (B)(1) within 12 months after termination of the Agreement the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal (substituting "20%" for "15%" in the definition thereof) or (2) within six months after such termination the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any transaction or series of transactions which, had such been proposed during the term of this Agreement, would have constituted an Acquisition Proposal (substituting "50%" for "15%" in the definition thereof), provided that the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Proposal described in the immediately preceding clause (1) or (2), as applicable, are subsequently consummated;   

then Buyer would suffer direct and substantial damages, which damages cannot
be determined with reasonable certainty and, in order to compensate Buyer for
such damages the Company shall pay to Buyer the amount of $25,000,000 by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated by
Buyer as liquidated damages (the "Termination Fee"). The Termination Fee
shall be due and payable (A) in the case of any termination by Buyer, within
three business days of termination of this Agreement and (B) in the case of
any termination by the Company, immediately prior to (and as condition to)
such termination; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii) of this Section 7.3(b), the Termination Fee shall be due and payable
immediately prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Acquisition Proposal. It is specifically agreed that the amount to be paid
pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) represents liquidated damages and not a
penalty.   

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) in circumstances under which the provisions of Section 7.3(b)(ii) are inapplicable, then the Company shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to lesser of (i) Buyers out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including without limitation all attorneys, accountants and investment bankers fees and expenses) and (ii) $5,000,000, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer within three business days of such termination.   

 (d) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii), then Buyer shall pay to the Company an amount equal to lesser of (i) the Companys out-of-pocket    ##### 

  

  

expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including without limitation all
attorneys, accountants and investment bankers fees and expenses) and (ii)
$5,000,000, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Company within three business days of such
termination.   

 (e) The remedies provided under Sections 7.3(b), 7.3(c) and 7.3(d) shall be exclusive of all other remedies at law or in equity; provided, however, that in the event of a willful breach by a party of any of its representations or warranties or willful failure to comply with any of its covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement, such remedies shall be non-exclusive and the other party shall be entitled to pursue any other remedy at law or in equity in respect of such breach or failure to comply.   

 7.4 Amendment. Subject to applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company; provided, however, that after the vote by the shareholders of the Company, there shall not be made any amendment that by law requires further approval by such shareholders without the further approval of such shareholders.   

 7.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing Date, any party hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction without the necessity of demonstrating damages or posting a bond, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.   

 8.8 Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction; provided, however, that any matter involving the internal corporate affairs of the Company or any party hereto shall be governed by the provisions of the jurisdictions of its incorporation. The rights of the shareholders of the Company, if any, shall be governed by the Laws of the State of Israel.   

 8.9 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto agree that they have jointly drafted and have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.   

 8.10 Assignment. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
