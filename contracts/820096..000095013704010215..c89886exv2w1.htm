Merger Sub as promptly as practicable following the execution hereof.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the &#147;Closing&#148;) shall take place at
the offices of Morgan, Lewis &#038; Bockius LLP, 101 Park Avenue, New York, NY
10178, at a time and on a date to be designated by the parties (the time and
date upon which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the

later to occur of: (a)&nbsp;the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article&nbsp;VI (other than those conditions which by their terms are to be
satisfied or waived as of the Closing); or (b)&nbsp;the 71st day after the delivery
of the Merger Proposal (as defined herein) to the office of the Companies
Registrar of the State of Israel (the &#147;Companies Registrar&#148;), or at such other

with each other, deliver to the Companies Registrar a notice (the &#147;Merger
Notice&#148;) informing the Companies Registrar that the Merger was approved by the
general shareholders meetings of Merger Sub and the Company, respectively. The
Merger shall become effective upon the issuance by the Companies Registrar of a
certificate evidencing the completion of the Merger in accordance with section
323(5) of the Israeli Companies Law. The time at which the Merger becomes
effective is referred to herein as the &#147;Effective Time&#148;.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time, without any action on

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversion of Company Shares. Each Ordinary Share, NIS 1.00 par value
per share, of the Company (collectively, the &#147;Company Shares&#148;) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Company
Shares held in the treasury of the Company or owned by Buyer or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or Buyer immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall automatically be converted into and represent the
right to receive the following (the &#147;Merger Consideration&#148;): (i)&nbsp;0.8011 shares
of common stock, without par value, of Buyer (the &#147;Buyer Common Stock&#148;); and
(ii) $14.93 in cash, in each case payable without interest to the holder of
such Company Share upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section&nbsp;1.4, of
the certificate that formerly evidenced such Company Share. Upon the issuance
of any Buyer Common Stock hereunder, and pursuant to Buyer&#146;s existing Rights
Agreement dated as of April&nbsp;10, 1996 (as the same may be amended from time to
time, the &#147;Rights Agreement&#148;) between Buyer and State Street Bank &#038; Trust
Company, as rights agent, one Preferred Share Purchase Right issuable pursuant
to the Rights Agreement or any other right issued in substitution
therefor (a &#147;Right&#148;) shall be issued together with and shall attach to

in the treasury of the Company or owned by Buyer or any direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or of Buyer immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired without any conversion or
consideration paid in respect thereof, and shall cease to exist.

option or right to acquire Company Shares then outstanding (each, a &#147;Company
Stock Option&#148;), whether or not then exercisable, shall be assumed by Buyer and
converted into an option to purchase shares of Buyer Common Stock in accordance
with this Section&nbsp;1.3(c). Each Company Stock Option so converted shall
continue to have, and be subject to, the same material terms and conditions
(including vesting schedule) as set forth in the applicable agreement pursuant
to which such Company Stock Option was granted immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that, as of the Effective Time, (i)&nbsp;each Company Stock
Option shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Buyer Common
Stock equal to the product of the number of Company Shares that were issuable
upon exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by 1.6022 (the &#147;Exchange Ratio&#148;), rounded to the nearest whole
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock, and (ii)&nbsp;the per share exercise price
for each share of Buyer Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Company
Stock Option so converted shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing
the exercise price per Company Share at which such Company Stock Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time (expressed in U.S. Dollars
based on the exchange rate in effect as of the close of business on the
business day immediately preceding the date hereof) by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded to the nearest whole cent. If not otherwise covered by a registration
statement on Form S-8 in place as of the Effective Time, then as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than 60&nbsp;days after the Closing, Buyer shall
register the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Company
Stock Option converted pursuant to this Section&nbsp;1.3(c) by filing an effective
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another
appropriate form with the SEC (as defined herein), and Buyer shall use
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement and maintain the current status of the prospectus with respect
thereto for so long as such options remain outstanding. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain any and all consents necessary to allow
for the conversion of the Company Stock Options as provided in this Section
1.3(c).

duly elected or appointed and qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub

per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable Ordinary Share, NIS 1.00 par value per share, of the Surviving
Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
evidence ownership of such shares of the Surviving Corporation.

be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any forward or reverse stock

fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Buyer Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder)
shall, upon surrender by such holder of each Certificate (as defined herein)
held thereby, receive from Buyer an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest
whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of (i)&nbsp;such fraction,
multiplied by (ii) $18.638. The parties hereto acknowledge that payment of the
cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately
bargained for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting complexities that
would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.

Section&nbsp;1.4(d) (collectively, the &#147;Exchange Fund&#148;). In the event the cash in
the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent hereunder (including pursuant to
Section&nbsp;1.3(h) and 1.4(d)), Buyer shall promptly make available to the Exchange
Agent the amounts so required to satisfy such payment obligations in full. The

effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificate to the Exchange Agent), that shall also be in such
form and have such other provisions as Buyer and the Company may reasonably
specify, and (ii)&nbsp;instructions (in the English and Hebrew languages) for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificate in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.3(h) and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.4(d), and
the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so
surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive, upon surrender and
without interest, the Merger Consideration into which the Company Shares
theretofore represented by such Certificates shall have been converted pursuant
to Section&nbsp;1.3, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock

that the Company&#146;s shareholders will receive per Company Share (valuing any
non-cash consideration at what the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisor, to be
the fair value of such non-cash consideration) and including a copy thereof
with all accompanying documentation, and (C)&nbsp;identifying the person making such
Superior Proposal, (ii)&nbsp;after cooperating in good faith with Buyer for a period
of not less than five business days to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with the
Company Recommendation without a Company Change in Recommendation (provided,
however, that any determination by Buyer to propose to make such adjustment to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be at the discretion of Buyer
at the time), and (iii)&nbsp;if Buyer does not, within five business days of Buyer&#146;s

Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be as favorable to
the Company&#146;s shareholders as such Superior Proposal.

the Post-Merger Employee, shall vest in three annual installments on each of
the first three anniversaries of the Closing Date (each such date, a &#147;Vesting
