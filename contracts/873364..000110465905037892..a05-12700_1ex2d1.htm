effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal (in each case, a "
_Dissenting Share_ ")) shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the applicable Merger Price or the Earn Out Payments, if any,
otherwise payable on such share pursuant to Section 2.2 of this Agreement,
but rather the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are
granted by the applicable provisions of the DGCL; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that any Dissenting Share held by a Person at the Effective Time who shall,
after the Effective Time, withdraw the demand for appraisal or lose the right
of appraisal, in either case pursuant to the DGCL, shall be deemed to be
converted into, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger

(e) _Treatment of Options_. Prior to the date hereof, the Board of Directors
of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) has adopted
appropriate resolutions and taken all other actions necessary to provide that
each outstanding stock option (each an " _Option_ ") heretofore granted under
the CompanyÂ’s 2001 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan (the " _Company Stock
Plan_ "), whether or not currently vested or exercisable at the Effective
Time, and which remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be cancelled, no longer be outstanding and cease to represent the right
to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and in consideration for such
cancellation, each holder of an Option shall, at the Effective Time, have the
right to receive an amount in cash from Parent in respect thereof equal to
the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
or related to such Option, and (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Price
applicable to the Company Common Stock over the exercise price or purchase
price, as the case may be, per share of Company Common Stock subject or
related to such Option (subject to any applicable withholding taxes, the "
_Cash Option Payment_ ") plus Earn Out Payments, if any, to be paid on such
Option in accordance with Section 2.2 as if such Option had been exercised
and converted into Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time. The Company Stock Plan and any Benefit Plan (or other plan, program or
arrangement) providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in
respect of the capital stock of the Company shall terminate upon the
Effective Time. The Company has taken all steps necessary to ensure that the
Company is not or will not be bound by any Options, other options, warrants,
rights or agreements which would entitle any person, other than the current
stockholders of Acquisition Corp. or its Affiliates, to acquire any capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(f) _Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase Company
Capital Stock that is outstanding as of the Effective Time (the " _Warrants_
") pursuant to any Warrant Agreements or otherwise shall be exercisable
solely for a payment in cash from Parent equal to the product of (x) the
total number of shares of Company Capital Stock subject or related to such
Warrant, and (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Price applicable to such
type of Company Capital Stock over the exercise price per share of
Company Capital Stock subject or related to such Warrant (the " _Cash Warrant
Payment_ ") plus Earn Out Payments, if any, to be paid to the holder of such
Warrant in accordance with Section 2.2 as if such Warrant had been exercised
for Company Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. The
Company shall take or cause to be taken, including as appropriate by its
Board of Directors or the appropriate committee thereof, all steps necessary,
if any, to give effect to the provisions of this Section 2.1(f). From and
after the Effective Time, holders of Warrants shall have no rights with
respect to their Warrants other than specifically provided in this Section
2.1(f).

5   

     
   

  



  

Agreement, (ii) on or before ten (10) days following the occurrence of such

by wire transfer of immediately available funds and (iii) cause the Payment
Agent to pay to each Stockholder (other than holders of Dissenting Shares), a
cash amount, without interest, equal to such StockholderÂ’s applicable pro-

(c) For the purposes of this Section 2.2,

  



  

(i) any distributions made by Parent pursuant to Sections 2.2(a) and (b)
shall hereinafter sometimes be referred to individually as an " _Earn Out
Payment_ " and collectively as the " _Earn Out Payments_ "; and

  



  

(ii) the occurrence of any of the events described in Sections 2.2(a) and (b)
that require payment shall hereinafter sometimes be referred to individually

(d) _Off-Set Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, ParentÂ’s obligation to pay the Earn Out Payments herein shall be
subject to the Surviving CorporationÂ’s and ParentÂ’s right to off-set against

time to time as indemnity payments pursuant to Article VII hereof.

  



  

(e) _Operations of the Business_. Except as to obligations related to the
continued development of Treanda set forth below in this Section 2.2(e), the

6   

     
   

  



  

(f) _Change of Control of Parent_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, if, following a Change of Control (as defined below) of
Parent, the business strategy of Parent or any successor to Parent or any
subsidiary thereof including the Surviving Corporation (collectively, a "
_Successor Entity_ ") changes such that the Successor Entity fails to use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (i) file an NDA for approval of Treanda
for the treatment of NHL or CLL and/or (ii) obtain FDA Approval for the
treatment of NHL or CLL (each a " _Trigger Event_ "), then the Earn Out
Payments, to the extent not already paid in accordance with this Section 2.2,
shall become immediately due and payable and Parent shall: (i) provide the
StockholdersÂ’ Representatives with written notice in accordance with Section
11.5 of this Agreement of such Trigger Event no later than five (5) days
following the occurrence of such Trigger Event, (ii) deposit with the Payment
Agent, for the benefit of the Stockholders (other than holders of Dissenting
Shares) the aggregate amount of such Earn Out Payments by wire transfer of
immediately available funds no later than ten (10) days following the
occurrence of such Trigger Event and (iii) cause the Payment Agent,
immediately following the deposit of the funds in accordance with subsection
(ii) above, to pay to each Stockholder (other than holders of Dissenting
Shares), a cash amount, without interest, equal to such
StockholderÂ’s applicable pro-rata percentage of such amount as set forth on
_Exhibit F_  hereof. " _Change of Control_ " as used in this Section 2.2(f)

immediately prior to such transaction ceasing to represent at least fifty
percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the surviving entity
immediately after such transaction; (b) any third party (other than a trustee
or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan)

or business of Parent.

  



  

(g) By approving this Agreement, the Stockholders understand and agree that
following the Effective Time: (i) except as set forth in Sections 2.2(e) and
5.13, Parent will not have any obligation or liability relating to any
business plan of the Company or be legally bound by any such plan; (ii)
Parent shall have no obligation to consult with or discuss the business of
the Surviving Corporation and Parent with the Stockholders (provided Parent
shall have the obligation to provide information to the StockholdersÂ’
Representatives in accordance with Section 2.5(c)); (iii) Parent shall have
no obligation to retain any employees of the Company; (iv) the Stockholders
shall have no claim against Parent or the Surviving Corporation in connection
with the Earn Out Payments, if any, except pursuant to this Section 2.2, and
(v) subject to Parent/Surviving CorporationÂ’s obligations under this Section
2.2, the Earn Out Payments, if any, are contingent on the occurrence of the
Earn Out Events and there is no guarantee such events will occur. Parent
makes no representation and expresses no opinion as to the value of this
Section 2.2 to the Stockholders.

  



  

Section 2.3. _Deposits of Funds at Closing_. On or before the Closing Date,
Parent shall deposit with the Payment Agent the Acquisition Price payable to
the Stockholders set forth on _Exhibit F_ minus $250,000 to be deposited
with an escrow agent for the purpose of paying the expenses, if any, incurred
by the StockholdersÂ’ Representatives in connection with this Agreement (the "
_Stockholders Â’ Representatives Escrow Fund_"). The StockholdersÂ’

  



  

7   

     
   

  



  

Representatives Escrow Fund will be withheld on a pro-rata basis from the
holders of Company Capital Stock set forth on _Exhibit F_ hereof based on
such holderÂ’s applicable percentage of the Acquisition Price and deposited
into the StockholdersÂ’ Representatives Escrow Fund to be held under the terms
of an escrow agreement to be entered into by and between the StockholdersÂ’
Representatives and an escrow agent identified by the Company. Promptly
following the earlier of (a) June 30, 2008 or (b) one (1) year following the
occurrence of the Earn Out Event set forth in Section 2.2(a), the
StockholdersÂ’ Representatives shall cause any amount remaining in the
StockholdersÂ’ Representatives Escrow Fund and not otherwise allocable to any
outstanding expenses incurred by the StockholdersÂ’ Representatives during the
Indemnity Period to be deposited with the Payment Agent and shall cause the
Payment Agent to pay to each holder of Company Capital Stock (other than
holders of Dissenting Shares), a cash amount, without interest, equal to such
holderÂ’s applicable pro-rata percentage of such remaining amount, based on
the percentages set forth in _Exhibit F_.

  



  

Section 2.4. _Payment for Certificates, Options and Warrants_.

  



  

(a) _Payment Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any
event not later than five (5) business days) after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (the " _Certificates_
") whose shares are converted in accordance with Section 2.1(c) into the
right to receive the applicable Merger Price plus Earn Out Payments, if any,
to be paid to such holder in accordance with Section 2.2 of this Agreement,
to each holder of record of an agreement representing outstanding Options for
which a Cash Option Payment is to be made in accordance with Section 2.1(e)
(the " _Option Agreements_ ") plus Earn Out Payments, if any, to be paid to
such holder in accordance with Section 2.2 of this Agreement, and to each
holder of record of a Warrant for which a Cash Warrant Payment is to be made
in accordance with Section 2.1(f) plus Earn Out Payments, if any, to be paid
to such holder in accordance with Section 2.2 of this Agreement, (i) a letter
of transmittal in substantially the form set forth on _Exhibit G_ and (ii)
customary instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates, Option Agreements or Warrant, as the case may be, in exchange
for the portions of the Merger Price deposited with the Payment Agent plus
the right to receive Earn Out Payments in accordance with Section 2.2 of this
Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate, Option Agreement, or Warrant to
the Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed
and completed in accordance with its terms, the holder of such Certificate,
Option Agreement or Warrant shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
a check representing, (i) in the case of a Certificate, such portion, if any,
of the aggregate Merger Price per share of Company Capital Stock represented
thereby which such holder has the right to receive in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.1(c) and in an amount with respect to such holder as
set forth on _Exhibit F_ plus the right to receive Earn Out Payments, if any,
in accordance with Section 2.2 of this Agreement, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled, (ii) in the case of an Option
Agreement, such portion of the Cash Option Payment represented thereby which
such holder has the right to receive in accordance with Section 2.1(e) plus
the right to receive Earn Out Payments, if any, in accordance with Section
2.2 of this Agreement, and (iii) in the case of a Warrant, such portion of

  



  

8   

     
   

  



  

the Cash Warrant Payment represented thereby which such holder has the right
to receive in accordance with Section 2.1(f) plus the right to receive Earn
Out Payments, if any, in accordance with Section 2.2 of this Agreement. If
any Merger Price is to be remitted to a person whose name is other than that
in which the Certificate for shares of Company Capital Stock surrendered for
exchange is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed, with signature
guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall have paid any transfer and/or other taxes
required by reason of the remittance of Merger Price to a person whose name
is other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered,
or the person requesting such exchange shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid
or is not applicable.  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in no
event shall the holder of any Certificate, Option Agreement or Warrant be
entitled to receive interest on any funds to be received in the Merger. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.4(a), each Certificate (other
than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at all
times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Price plus the right to receive Earn Out Payments, if any, in
accordance with Section 2.2 of this Agreement, each Warrant shall be deemed
at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
the Cash Warrant Payment plus the right to receive Earn Out Payments, if any,
in accordance with Section 2.2 of this Agreement, and each Option Agreement
shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Cash Option Payment plus the right to receive Earn Out
Payments, if any, in accordance with Section 2.2 of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. From and after
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Capital Stock
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

  



  

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Acquisition Price
deposited by Parent with the Payment Agent which remains undistributed to the
Stockholders for six (6) months after the Effective Time as well as any
portion of an Earn Out Payment deposited by Parent with the Payment Agent in
accordance with Section 2.2 of this Agreement which remains undistributed to
the Stockholders for six (6) months after the occurrence of an applicable
Earn Out Event shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any Stockholders who have not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat
and other similar laws) as general creditors for payment of their claim for

amount disputed and the basis for the dispute, together with supporting
documentation reflecting the analysis and justification thereof. Parent and
the StockholdersÂ’ Representatives shall thereafter attempt to resolve the

in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its assets and properties makes such qualification or

each outstanding Option to become fully vested and exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

Section 3.4. _No Conflicts; Governmental Requirements_.

  



  

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and, assuming the receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, the consummation

contemplated hereby, or (iii) result in a violation or breach of, conflict
with, or constitute a default (or an event which, with the passage of time or

default) under, or result in or give rise to any right of termination,
modification, cancellation or acceleration, or require any consent, approval
or notice under, any note, bond, indenture, license, lien, franchise,
mortgage, loan or credit agreement, contract, agreement, lease, permit,

a party or by which any of its assets or properties may be bound, except, in
the case of clauses (ii) or (iii) of this Section 3.4(a), for any violation,

or render unlawful the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iv) consents, approvals,
authorizations, permissions, notices or filings which have heretofore been
obtained or made, as the case may be, by the Company, are in full force and
effect and copies of which have been provided to Parent, the execution and

governmental or regulatory authority, domestic or foreign.

(a) The manufacturing, processing, distribution, labeling and storage of
clinical trial supplies performed by or, to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, on

applicable to products in pre-commercial clinical development in accordance
with industry standard practices.

  



  

(b) To the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, all pre-clinical and clinical investigations
conducted or sponsored by the Company are being conducted in material

(c) The Company has made available to Parent all material information known
to it with respect to the safety or efficacy of the Product Candidates. To
the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, the Company is not in possession of information that
would reasonably be expected to lead to the denial by FDA of an application
for regulatory approval necessary for the sale (" _Regulatory Approva_ l") in
the United States of Treanda for use as a single agent for the NHL indication
specified in the SPA Resubmission, provided that the development of Treanda
for such indication proceeds in adherence to the Treanda Development Plan
dated March 15, 2005, as updated in the SPA Resubmisson dated April 29, 2005
and by the Update to IND # 67,554 dated April 11, 2005. To the
CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, the Company is not in possession of information that

Approval in the United States of Treanda for CLL. To the CompanyÂ’s
Knowledge, if the development of SDX-101 for the indication of CLL in the
United States proceeds in adherence

  



  

14

possession of information that would reasonably be expected to lead to the
denial by FDA of Regulatory Approval in the United States of SDX-101 for CLL.

SDX-101 Development Plan dated March 17, 2005, the SPA Re-submission (with
respect to a single agent) dated April 29, 2005 and the Update to IND #

finding, warning letters or other written correspondence or notice from FDA
or any other Governmental Entity responsible for regulating the
pharmaceutical industry alleging or asserting noncompliance with any
applicable laws; (ii) has no Knowledge or reason to believe that the FDA or
other such Governmental Entity is considering such action described in
subsection (i) above; (iii) has no Knowledge of any actual or threatened
prosecution, injunction, seizure, civil fine, suspension, recall or other
enforcement action or proceeding by FDA or other Governmental Entity
responsible for regulating the pharmaceutical industry alleging that the
Company is not currently in compliance with any and all applicable laws,
regulations or orders; and (iv) has no Knowledge that any such Governmental
Entity is considering such action described in subsection (iii) above; in
each of (i) through (iv) above, except for such actions as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. To the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, none of the Company Workers is or
has been the subject of any of the foregoing pending or threatened actions or
proceedings.

  



  

(e) To the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, no data generated by it or on its behalf is
the subject of any regulatory or other action, either pending or threatened,
by the FDA or other Governmental Entity responsible for regulating the
pharmaceutical industry relating to the truthfulness of such data.

  



  

(f) To the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, it is not the subject, officially or
otherwise, of any pending or threatened investigation by the FDA pursuant to
its Fraud, Untrue, Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities Final
Policy set forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September 10, 1991) and any
amendments thereto, or by the Department of Health and Human Services Office
of Inspector General (" _OIG_ ") or United States Department of Justice ("
_DOJ_ ") pursuant to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute 42 U.S.C. Section
1320a-7(b) and the Civil False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. Section 3729 et seq.)
and the regulations promulgated pursuant to such statutes.

  



  

(g) To the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, neither it nor any of the Company Workers
has knowingly committed any act, made any statement, or failed to make
any statement, that would reasonably be expected to provide a basis for the
FDA to invoke its Fraud, Untrue, Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal
Gratuities Final Policy or that would reasonably be expected to provide a
basis for liability under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute or the Civil
False Claims Act and any regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

(h) Neither the Company nor to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, any of the Company
Workers, or any licensees, licensors or assignees of the Company Intellectual
Property has received any notice that the FDA or any other Governmental
Entity responsible for

  



  

15   

     
   

  



  

regulating the pharmaceutical industry has initiated, or threatened in
writing, or to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, orally to initiate, suspend or
terminate any Investigational New Drug Application sponsored by the Company,
or to recall, suspend or otherwise restrict the manufacture of any
pharmaceutical product of the Company.

  



  

(i) To the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, all animal studies or other preclinical
tests performed in connection with or as the basis for any regulatory
approval required for the Product Candidates either (x) have been conducted
in accordance, in all material respects, with applicable Good Laboratory
Practice requirements contained in 21 CFR Part 58, (y) were pilot safety
studies or (z) involved experimental research techniques that are not
generally performed by registered GLP testing laboratories and have employed
the procedures and controls generally used by qualified experts in animal or
preclinical study of products comparable to those being developed by the
Company.

  



  

(j) To the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, there are no proceedings pending with respect
to a violation by the Company of the FDCA, FDA regulations adopted thereunder
or any other legislation or regulation promulgated by any other Governmental
Entity responsible for regulating the pharmaceutical industry, except for
such proceedings as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(k) No employee of the Company is in violation of any term of any patent
disclosure agreement, or to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, any non-competition
agreement or any restrictive covenant (i) in favor of the Company, or (ii) to
a former employer relating to the right of any such employee to be employed
because of the nature of the business conducted by the Company or to the use
of trade secrets or proprietary information of others. To the CompanyÂ’s
Knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, no key employee or group of
employees has any plans to terminate employment with the Company.

of the Company as made available to Parent and its Representatives prior to

_Trial Event_ ") occurs on or prior to November 30, 2005, each of Parent and
Surviving Corporation further agree to pay all amounts due pursuant to such
Treanda bonus program to each participant in such Treanda bonus program who
was a non-executive employee at the Closing whether or not such employee is
employed by Parent or Surviving Corporation (" _Bonus Participants_ ") upon
the occurrence of the Trial Event, unless such non-executive employee
voluntarily resigns from the Surviving Corporation prior to the occurrence of
the Trial Event; provided, however that if the Trial Event does not occur on
or prior to November 30, 2005 primarily as a result of a delay caused by
Parent or Surviving Corporation (other than delays resulting from regulatory,
safety or quality issues outside of the control of Parent or Surviving
Corporation), the Parent and Surviving Corporation will pay all amounts due
pursuant to the Treanda bonus program to Bonus Participants, other than those
Bonus Participant that have voluntarily resigned prior to November 30, 2005.
A table listing the Bonus Participants as of Closing and the cash bonus
payments to be awarded to each Bonus Participant under the program will be
attached to Schedule 5.13(d) at Closing.

and expenses including those incurred to enforce the terms of this Agreement

as of a specified date earlier than the Closing Date, on and as of such
earlier date), of any representation or warranty made by the Company in this
Agreement or (y) any failure by the Company to perform or fulfill any of its
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,

42   

     
   

  



  

Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover any Loss otherwise
recoverable pursuant to Section 7.2(i)(x) only to the extent the aggregate of
Losses otherwise recoverable pursuant to such Section exceeds $1,000,000 in
the aggregate; _provided_ , _that_ , if all such Losses exceed $1,000,000,
the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover for all such Losses;

  



  

(b) the aggregate amount to be paid to the Indemnified Parties under Section
7.2(i)(x) in respect of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.8, 3.14, 3.15 and 3.17
shall be unlimited, subject to Sections 7.4(b) and (c); and

  



  

(c) the aggregate amount to be paid to the Indemnified Parties as a result of
claims based upon fraud or knowing misrepresentation shall be unlimited, as

Section 7.4. _Additional Indemnification Limitations_.

  



  

(a) The Indemnified PartiesÂ’ sole recourse for indemnification due to any
Loss under Section 7.2(i)(x) (in respect of Sections 3.4 through 3.7, 3.9
through 3.13, 3.16 and 3.18 through 3.29), Section 7.2(i)(y) and Section
7.2(ii) shall be solely by way of set off against the Earn Out Payments, if
any; _provided_ ,  _however_ , if an Earn Out Event triggering an Earn Out
Payment to the Company has not occurred as of the date of the Loss or Losses,
such Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to recover for any such Loss
until such time, if ever, an Earn Out Event triggering an Earn Out Payment to
the Company occurs and then only to the extent of the amount of such Earn Out
Payment.

  



  

(b) The Indemnified PartiesÂ’ sole recourse for indemnification due to Losses
under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.8, 3.14, 3.15 and 3.17 shall be solely by way
of set off against the Earn Out Payments, if any, to the extent that the
Losses pursuant to Section 7.2 are in the aggregate less than or equal to
$40,000,000; _provided_ ,  _however_ , if an Earn Out Event triggering an
Earn Out Payment to the Company has not occurred as of the date of such
Losses in an amount less than or equal to $40,000,000 in the aggregate, such
Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to recover for such Losses pursuant
to Section 7.2 until such time, if ever, an Earn Out Event triggering an Earn
Out Payment to the Company occurs and then only to the extent of the amount
of such Earn Out Payment.

  



  

(c) The Indemnified Parties shall have the right to seek recovery due to
Losses under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.8, 3.14, 3.15 and 3.17 at any time
(subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.3) directly from
the Stockholders to the extent that the Losses pursuant to Section 7.2 are in
excess of $40,000,000 in the aggregate, whether or not an Earn Out Event has
occurred and whether or not an Indemnified Party has recovered any Losses
less than or equal to $40,000,000 by way of set off or otherwise against any
Earn Out Payments; _provided_ ,  _however,_ the Indemnified Parties shall
only have the right to recover directly from the Stockholders the amount of
Losses in excess of $40,000,000 in the aggregate. For the avoidance
of doubt, in the event that there are no Losses under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3,
3.8, 3.14, 3.15 and 3.17 and Losses under other applicable Sections occur
which are, in the aggregate, in excess of $40,000,000, no amounts may be
recovered directly from the Stockholders. For example, in the

  



  

43   

     
   

  



  

event that the Losses under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.8, 3.14, 3.15 and 3.17
are, in the aggregate, equal to $10,000,000 and the Losses under other
applicable Sections are, in the aggregate, equal to $35,000,000, then only
$5,000,000 may be recovered directly from the Stockholders.

  



  

(d) Irrespective of whether an Earn Out Event has occurred and whether or not
an Indemnified Party has recovered any Losses by way of set off or otherwise
against any Earn Out Payments, the Indemnified Parties shall have the right
to seek recovery of any Losses at any time directly from the Stockholders
with respect to Losses based upon fraud or knowing misconduct, as set forth
in Section 7.8(i).

  



  

Section 7.5. _Notice of Claims_. If any of the Indemnified Parties believes
that it has suffered or incurred any Loss, it shall notify the StockholdersÂ’
Representatives promptly in writing (at its address set forth in Section
11.5), and in any event within the applicable time period specified
in Section 7.1, describing such Loss, all with reasonable particularity
and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of
which such Loss shall have occurred (a " _Claim Notice_ "). If any legal
action is instituted by a third party with respect to which any of the
Indemnified Parties intend to claim indemnity under this Section 7.5, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly give a Claim Notice to notify the
StockholdersÂ’ Representatives with respect to such legal action. In any
event, a failure or delay in notifying the StockholdersÂ’ Representatives
shall not affect the Indemnified PartyÂ’s right to indemnity, except only to
the extent such failure or delay materially and adversely prejudices the
ability to defend against any legal action.

  



  

Section 7.6. _Defense of Third Party Claims_. Because the right to indemnity
is limited as provided herein, the Indemnified Parties shall have the right
to conduct and control, through counsel of their own choosing, reasonably
acceptable to the StockholdersÂ’ Representatives, any third party legal action
or other claim, but the StockholdersÂ’ Representatives may, at their election,
participate in the defense thereof at their sole cost and expense; _provided_
,  _however_ , that if the Indemnified Parties shall fail to defend any
such legal action or other claim, then the StockholdersÂ’ Representatives may
defend, through counsel of their own choosing, such legal action or other
claim, and so long as they give Parent at least fifteen (15) daysÂ’ notice of
the terms of the proposed settlement thereof and permit Parent to then
undertake the defense thereof, except as set forth below, settle such legal
action or other claim and recover the amount of such settlement or of any
judgment and the costs and expenses of such defense. Neither Parent nor the
StockholdersÂ’ Representatives shall compromise or settle any such
legal action or other claim without the prior written consent of the other,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, except that under no
circumstances shall Parent be required to consent to the entry of an order
for injunctive or other non-monetary relief. All costs and expenses
reasonably incurred in defending any such third party legal action or other
claim, including the amount of any settlement or of any judgment, shall be
paid out as provided herein.

  



  

Section 7.7. _Dispute Resolution Negotiation_.

  



  

(a) The Stockholders and Parent shall attempt to resolve any dispute arising
out of or relating to this Agreement promptly by negotiation in good faith
between an agent

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

chosen by the StockholdersÂ’ Representatives and an executive officer of
Parent who has authority to settle the dispute. Each Party shall give the
other party involved written notice of any dispute not resolved in the
ordinary course of business. Within seven days after delivery of such
notice, the party receiving notice shall submit to the other a written
response thereto. The notice and the response shall include: (i) a statement
of each partyÂ’s position(s) regarding the matter(s) in dispute and a summary
of arguments in support thereof, and (ii) the name and title of the executive
officer who will represent Parent and any other Person who will accompany
that executive officer, in the case of Parent, or the name of the agent who
will represent the Stockholders and any other Person who will accompany that
agent, in the case of the Stockholders.

  



  

(b) Within 14 days after delivery of the notice, the designated agent of the
StockholdersÂ’ Representatives and the designated executive officer of Parent
shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place, and thereafter, as often
as they reasonably deem necessary, to attempt to resolve the dispute. All
reasonable requests for information made by one party to the other shall be
honored in a timely fashion. All negotiations conducted pursuant to
this Section 7.7 (and any of the partiesÂ’ submissions in contemplation
hereof) shall be kept confidential by the parties and shall be treated by the
parties and their representatives as compromise and settlement negotiations
under the Federal Rules of Evidence and any similar state rules.

  



  

Section 7.8. _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for (i) claims based upon fraud or
knowing misrepresentation, and (ii) injunctive relief to enforce a partyÂ’s
rights under this Agreement, (a) the remedies set forth in Article VII
hereof, including Section 7.2, constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
for breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement and (b) in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation have any obligation with respect to any breach of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in Article
III hereof.

  



  

Section 7.9. _Tax Matters_. The Company shall cause to be prepared and filed
prior to the Effective Time all federal, state and local income Tax Returns
of the Company that are required to be filed on or before the Effective Time
and shall pay, prior to the Effective Time, all Taxes required to be paid
with respect to such Tax Returns. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared
in accordance with all applicable laws and shall accurately reflect the
taxable income and operations of the Company for all taxable periods covered
by such Tax Returns. The Company shall deliver to Parent, at least 15 days
prior to the Effective Time, draft copies of all such income Tax Returns that
are required to be prepared and filed pursuant to this Section 7.9 for
ParentÂ’s review and consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The Company shall provide Parent with reasonable cooperation with
respect to its review of the Tax Returns.
