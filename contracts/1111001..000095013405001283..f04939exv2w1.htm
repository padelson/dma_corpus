&#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;), by and among INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES
CORPORATION, a New York corporation (&#147;<U>Parent</U>&#148;), NIKE ACQUISITION
CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(&#147;<U>Sub</U>&#148;), and CORIO, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
&#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Sub deems it in the best interests

subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, of Sub with and into the Company in which
the Company would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and such Boards of Directors have
approved this Agreement and declared its advisability (and, in the case of the Board of Directors
of the Company, recommended that this Agreement be adopted by the Company&#146;s stockholders);


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement
to the willingness of Parent and Sub to enter into this Agreement, Parent and certain stockholders
of the Company (the &#147;<U>Principal Stockholders</U>&#148;) are entering into a voting agreement (the
&#147;<U>Stockholders Agreement</U>&#148;) pursuant to which the Principal Stockholders are agreeing to take
certain action in furtherance of the Merger;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to
the Merger;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, certain employees of the Company
are entering into agreements with Parent;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Common Stock, par value

of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock.</U> All shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company, as treasury stock, Parent or Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>Conversion of Company Common Stock.</U> Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (x)&nbsp;shares to be
canceled and retired in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.01(b) and (y)&nbsp;the Appraisal Shares) shall
be converted into the right to receive $2.82 in cash, without interest (the &#147;<U>Merger
Consideration</U>&#148;). At the Effective Time such shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares (a
&#147;<U>Certificate</U>&#148;) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. The right of any holder of any share of Company
Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the
amount of any withholding that is required under applicable tax Law as provided in Section
2.02(f) hereof.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <U>Appraisal Rights.</U> Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (the &#147;<U>Appraisal Shares</U>&#148;) of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL (&#147;<U>Section
262</U>&#148;) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in Section&nbsp;2.01(c), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the
fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section&nbsp;262. At the
Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with

shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section&nbsp;262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is
not entitled to the relief provided by Section&nbsp;262, then the right of such holder to be
paid the fair value of such holder&#146;s Appraisal Shares under Section&nbsp;262 shall cease and
such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into,
and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of
any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do
any of the foregoing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 2.02. <U>Exchange of Certificates.</U> (a) <U>Paying Agent.</U> Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company
to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the
&#147;<U>Paying Agent</U>&#148;), and, from time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available, or cause the Surviving Corporation to make available, to the Paying Agent funds for the
benefit of the former holders of Company Common Stock in amounts and at the times necessary for the
payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates, it
being understood that any and all interest earned on funds made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over to Parent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;<U>Exchange Procedure.</U> As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i)&nbsp;a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent
or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares formerly represented by such Certificate
shall have been converted pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Parent shall not take any action that would prevent the Paying Agent from
making payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with its customary procedures. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock
transfer books of the

other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to
a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be
paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;<U>No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.</U> All cash paid upon the
surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article&nbsp;II shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of
the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or
any other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article&nbsp;II.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;<U>No Liability.</U> None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official in accordance with any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been
surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date
on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or became the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of

contingent) the right to vote (or which is convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities
having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company or any of its

practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to forebear from taking any actions that would cause the Merger and
