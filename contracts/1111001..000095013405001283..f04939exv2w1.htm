 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of January 24, 2005 (this " _Agreement_ "), by and among INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION, a New York corporation (" _Parent_ "), NIKE ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and CORIO, INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").   

 WHEREAS the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Sub deems it in the best interests of their respective stockholders to consummate the merger (the " _Merger_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, of Sub with and into the Company in which the Company would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and such Boards of Directors have approved this Agreement and declared its advisability (and, in the case of the Board of Directors of the Company, recommended that this Agreement be adopted by the Companys stockholders);   

 WHEREAS concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Sub to enter into this Agreement, Parent and certain stockholders of the Company (the " _Principal Stockholders_ ") are entering into a voting agreement (the " _Stockholders Agreement_ ") pursuant to which the Principal Stockholders are agreeing to take certain action in furtherance of the Merger;   

 WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger;   

 WHEREAS concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, certain employees of the Company are entering into agreements with Parent;   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:   

ARTICLE I    

The Merger    

 SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").    ##### 

  

 

2 

 SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 11:00 a.m., New York time, on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be not later than the second business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".   

 SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time of the Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, the parties shall file a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such subsequent date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_ ".   

 SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.   

 SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws._ (a) The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in the form of Exhibit A hereto and, as so amended, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until hereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.   

 (a) The Bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.   

 SECTION 1.06. _Directors._ The directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.   

 SECTION 1.07. _Officers._ The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.    #####

ARTICLE II    

Conversion of Securities    

 SECTION 2.01. _Conversion of Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Sub:    

 (a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.    

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company, as treasury stock, Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.    

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (x) shares to be canceled and retired in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and (y) the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $2.82 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time such shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The right of any holder of any share of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable tax Law as provided in Section 2.02(f) hereof.    

 (d) _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with    ##### 

  

 

4  

the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such
holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the
right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and
shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received
by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to
do or commit to do any of the foregoing.   

 SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and, from time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available, or cause the Surviving Corporation to make available, to the Paying Agent funds for the benefit of the former holders of Company Common Stock in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates, it being understood that any and all interest earned on funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over to Parent.   

 (b) _Exchange Procedure._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares formerly represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Parent shall not take any action that would prevent the Paying Agent from making payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with its customary procedures. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the    ##### 

  

 

5 

Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be made
to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All cash paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.   

 (d) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or became the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 (f) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal     ##### 

 

  

 6    

Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.    

ARTICLE III    

Representations and Warranties    

 SECTION 3.01. _Representations and Warranties of the Company._ Except as set forth in the letter (with specific reference to the section of this Agreement to which the information stated in such disclosure relates, _provided_ that disclosure in any section of such letter shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other Section of this Agreement to the extent that it is readily apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other Section) delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows:   

 (a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power._ Each of the Company and its subsidiaries (i) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization (except, in the case of good standing, for entities organized under the Laws of any jurisdiction that does not recognize such concept), (ii) has all requisite corporate, company or partnership power and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction (except, in the case of good standing, any jurisdiction that does not recognize such concept) in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than where the failure to be so organized, existing, qualified or licensed or in good standing (except in the case of clause (i) above with respect to the Company), individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of each of its subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date of this Agreement. The Company has made available to Parent and its representatives true and complete copies of the minutes of all meetings of the stockholders, the Board of Directors and each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and each of its subsidiaries held since January 1, 2001.   

 (b) _Subsidiaries._ Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each subsidiary of the Company. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other    ##### 

 

 

  7    

equity or voting interests in, each such subsidiary are owned by the Company,
by another wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or by the Company and
another wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of all
pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any
kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ "), except for transfer
restrictions imposed by applicable securities laws, and are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except for the capital stock
of, or other equity or voting interests in, its subsidiaries, the Company
does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity
or voting interests in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture,
association, limited liability company or other entity.    

 (c) _Capital Structure._ (i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 200,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "). At the close of business on January 19, 2005, (A) 64,602,250 shares of Company Common Stock (excluding treasury shares) were issued and outstanding, (B) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued as outstanding, (C) no shares of Company Common Stock were held by the Company as treasury shares, (D) options to acquire 17,386,811 shares of Company Common Stock from the Company (the " _Stock Options_ ") pursuant to the 1998 Stock Option Plan and the 2001 Nonstatutory Stock Plan (such plans, collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") were issued and outstanding, (E) 2,775,245 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved and available for issuance pursuant to the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ "), (F) no shares of Company Common Stock were subject to a right of repurchase by, or subject to forfeiture back to, the Company (" _Restricted Stock_ ") and (G) no rights to acquire shares of Restricted Stock from the Company, pursuant to the Company Stock Plans were issued and outstanding. No shares of Company Common Stock are owned by any subsidiary of the Company. The Company has delivered to Parent (x) a true and complete list, as of the close of business on January 24, 2005, of all outstanding Stock Options, the number of shares subject to each such Stock Option, the grant dates and exercise prices and vesting schedule of each such Stock Option and the names of the holders thereof and (y) true and complete copies of the forms of Contracts evidencing the Stock Options. All outstanding Stock Options are evidenced by Contracts substantially in one of such forms, and no outstanding Stock Option contains terms that are materially inconsistent with, or in addition to, the terms contained in such forms. As of the close of business on January 19, 2005 there were outstanding Stock Options to purchase 14,335,265 shares of Company Common Stock with exercise prices on a per share basis lower than the Merger Consideration. As of the close of business on January 19, 2005, there were outstanding rights to purchase no more than 446,634 shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPP (assuming the current offering period under the ESPP ended on such date and based on the fair market value of the Company Common Stock on such date). For the most recent bi-weekly payroll period ending prior to January 19, 2005, the aggregate amount of accumulated payroll deductions pursuant to the ESPP was $626,404.48 and the aggregate amount actually deducted for that payroll period was $48,407.14.    #####

 (ii) Except as set forth above, as of the close of business on January 19, 2005, no shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company, or options, warrants, calls or other rights to acquire or receive any such stock or interests were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. Since January 19, 2005, until the date of this Agreement, (x) there have been no issuances by the Company of shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company, other than issuances of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of Stock Options or rights under the ESPP, in each case outstanding on such date as required by their terms as in effect on the date of this Agreement and (y) there have been no issuances by the Company of options, warrants, calls or other rights to acquire shares of capital stock or other equity or voting interests from the Company, other than for rights that may have arisen under the ESPP. There are no outstanding stock appreciation rights, phantom stock awards or other similar rights (other than rights that may have arisen under the ESPP) that are linked in any way to the price of the Company Common Stock or the value of the Company or any part thereof whether or not granted in tandem with a related Stock Option.    

 (iii) All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are, and all shares that may be issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and the ESPP will be, when issued in accordance with the terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights. Except as set forth above, there are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and no securities or other instruments or obligations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in each case, the value of which is in any way based upon or derived from any capital or voting stock of the Company or which has or which by its terms may have at any time (whether actual or contingent) the right to vote (or which is convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company or any of its subsidiaries may vote. Except (A) as set forth above and (B) for rights that have arisen under the ESPP, there are no securities, options, warrants, calls, rights or other Contracts of any kind to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound, obligating the Company or any of its subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of its subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such security, option, warrant, call, right or other Contract. Each Stock Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies and the exercise price of each other Stock Option is no less than the fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock as determined on the date of grant of such Stock Option. As of the date of this Agreement, the Original Shares (as defined in the    ##### 

 

 

 9    

       | Stockholders Agreement) represent 29.45% of the shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding. There are not any outstanding contractual
obligations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to (i) repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of, or other equity
or voting interests in, the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (ii) vote
or dispose of any shares of the capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, any of its subsidiaries. The Company is not a party to any

other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its subsidiaries
and, to the knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, other
than the Stockholders Agreement, there are no irrevocable proxies and no
voting agreements with respect to any shares of the capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

 (d) _Authority; Noncontravention._ The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject, in the case of the Merger, to obtaining the Stockholder Approval and to comply with the provisions of this Agreement.

41 

and October 15, 2004 and as it may thereafter be amended from time to time),
between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ");
_provided_ that all such information is provided on a prior or substantially
concurrent basis to Parent and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.02(b) to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may,     ##### 

  

 

42 

in response to a Superior Proposal that was unsolicited and that did not
otherwise result from a breach of Section 4.02(a), cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) and concurrently enter
into an Acquisition Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f), and any
purported termination pursuant to Section 7.01(f) shall be void and of no
force or effect, unless the Company shall have complied with all the
provisions of this Section 4.02, including the notification provisions in
this Section 4.02, and with all applicable requirements of Section 5.06(b)
(including the payment of the Termination Fee prior to or concurrently with
such termination) in connection with such Superior Proposal; and _provided_
_further_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not exercise its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) until after the fifth
business day following Parents receipt of written notice (a " _Notice
of Superior Proposal_ ") from the Company advising Parent that the Board of
Directors of the Company has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the
terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal, identifying the person making
such Superior Proposal and stating that the Board of Directors of the Company
intends to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section

taking effect, any amendment to the price or any other material term of a
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new

 For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any binding written offer not solicited by or on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries made by a third party that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith to be bona fide which, if consummated, would result in such third party (or in the case of a direct merger between such third party and the Company, the stockholders of such third party) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting power of the Company Common Stock or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment to have a higher value than the consideration payable in the Merger and which proposal is determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company to be more favorable to the Companys stockholders than the Merger, in each case taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or otherwise.   

 (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company promptly shall advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for information that contemplates a possible Takeover Proposal or of any Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry the Company reasonably believes could lead to a Takeover Proposal, the terms and conditions of such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any subsequent amendment or other modification to such terms and conditions) and the identity of the person making any such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry.

43  

confer with Parent regarding the progress of negotiations concerning any such
Takeover Proposal and the material resolved and unresolved issues related
thereto, (ii) promptly advise Parent of any material amendments or proposed
amendments as to price and other material terms of any such request, Takeover
Proposal or inquiry and (iii) promptly upon receipt or delivery
thereof, provide Parent with copies of all documents and written

directors, officers, employees, representatives or advisors relating to such
Takeover Proposal exchanged between the Company or any of its officers,
directors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors, on
the one hand, and the party making a Takeover Proposal or any of its
officers, directors, investment banks, attorneys, accountants or other
advisors, on the other hand.    

 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, agree or resolve to take any action prohibited by Section 4.02(b).   

 SECTION 4.03. _Conduct by Parent._ During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, except as consented to in writing by the Company prior to such action or as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to, take any action that would or is reasonably likely to result in (i) any representation and warranty of Parent or Sub set forth in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality or material adverse effect becoming untrue (as so qualified) or (ii) any such representation and warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue in any material respect.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, absent any Legal Restraint which has the effect of preventing such action, the Company shall, subject to Parents reasonable cooperation, file with the SEC the definitive Proxy Statement on the 10th calendar day (or, if such calendar day is not a business day, the first business day     #####

not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly

the Company.

45   

reasonable efforts during such ten-business day period to obtain such a quorum
as soon as practicable and (ii) the Company may delay the Stockholders
Meeting to the extent (and only to the extent) the Company reasonably
determines that such delay is required by applicable Law to comply with
written or oral comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement
(the date on which the Stockholders Meeting would be held pursuant to this
Section 5.01(b) (without giving effect to any extension pursuant to Section
5.01(c) or 5.10(d)) the " _Meeting Date_ "). Subject to Section 4.02(b)(i),
the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend to holders of the
Company Common Stock that they adopt this Agreement, and shall include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section
5.01(b) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company or any other person of any
Takeover Proposal.    

 (c) Parent may, in its sole discretion, extend, prior to the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company, any of (x) the time period from the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement to the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company as set forth in Section 5.01(a) and (y) the time period from the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company to the date on which the Stockholders Meeting is held as set forth in Section 5.01(b) (in each of (x) and (y), after giving effect to any extension thereof resulting from the exercise by the Company of any of its rights provided for in Section 5.01(d)); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will the aggregate extensions by Parent pursuant to this Section 5.01(c) and the Company pursuant to Section 5.01(d) extend the Meeting Date by more than ten (10) calendar days.   

 (d) The Company may, in its sole discretion, extend, prior to the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company, any of (x) the time period from the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement to the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company as set forth in Section 5.01(a) and (y) the time period from the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company to the date on which the Stockholders Meeting is held as set forth in Section 5.01(b) (in each of (x) and (y), after giving effect to any extension thereof resulting from the exercise by Parent of any of its rights provided for in Section 5.01(c)); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will the aggregate extensions by the Company pursuant to this Section 5.01(d) and Parent pursuant to Section 5.01(c) extend the Meeting Date by more than ten (10) calendar days.   

 SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ (a) At Parents reasonable request, subject to the requirements of applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, afford to Parents officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, environmental consultants and other advisors and representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours upon reasonable notice, and in a manner that is not materially disruptive to the Companys business    #####

control, former auditors), other advisors and representatives and records
and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
subsidiaries to, make available to Parent and allow Parent to make copies (at
its own expense) of, (i) each report, schedule, form, statement and other
document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of any applicable Law or Judgment (other than the notification

if requested by Parent, pursuant to a joint defense agreement in customary
form entered into between Parent and the Company or each of their respective
counsel, (ii) all organizational documents, stock certificates and other
evidences of equity interests, shareholders registers and other registers of
equity interests, minute books, certificates of good standing, authorizations
to do business and certified accounts of each subsidiary of the Company and
(iii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel

investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors and
representatives to hold, any and all information received from the Company,
directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with, and subject to the
exceptions contained in, the Confidentiality Agreement.

 (c) The Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of their respective subsidiaries to, cooperate to develop an orderly transition and integration process in connection with the Merger with the objective of minimizing the disruption to,    ##### 

  

  

47  

and preserving the value of, the business of the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries during the period from and after the Effective Time. The Company
and Parent agree that such cooperation shall include taking such actions as

mutually acceptable integration plan.    

 SECTION 5.03. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Notification._ (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most reasonably expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to forebear from taking any actions that would cause the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be consummated and made effective in the most reasonably expeditious manner practicable, including using its commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all reasonable actions necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from, and the giving of any necessary notices to, Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including filings under the HSR Act and other registrations, declarations and filings with, or notices to, Governmental Entities, if any), (iii) the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity and (iv) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties. In connection with and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any party hereto be obligated to, and the Company and its subsidiaries shall not, (A) agree or proffer to divest or hold separate, or enter into any licensing or similar arrangement with respect to, any assets (whether tangible or intangible) or any portion of any business of Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or (B) litigate any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, brought by any Governmental Entity (1) challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger; (2) seeking to prohibit or limit the ownership or operation by the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates of any portion of the business or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to require any such person to dispose of or hold separate any portion of the business or    #####

its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as a result of the Merger; (3) seeking to
impose limitations on the ability of Parent or any of its affiliates to

stock of the Surviving Corporation on all matters properly presented to the
stockholders of the Surviving Corporation; or (4) seeking to prohibit Parent
or any of its affiliates from effectively controlling the business or
operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company
and Parent shall provide such assistance, information and cooperation to each
other as is reasonably required to obtain any such non-actions, waivers,
consents, approvals, orders and authorizations and, in connection therewith,
will notify the other person promptly following the receipt of any comments
from any Governmental Entity and of any request by any Governmental
Entity for amendments, supplements or additional information in respect of
any registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, such Governmental
Entity and shall supply the other person with copies of all correspondence
between such person or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Entity, on the other hand.    

 (b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) would not be satisfied or (ii) the failure of it to perform in any material respect any obligation to be performed by it under this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 6.02(b) would not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.   

 (c) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of (i) any representation or warranty made by it or Sub contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) would not be satisfied or (ii) the failure of it or Sub to perform in any material respect any obligation to be performed by such party under this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 6.03(b) would not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

 SECTION 5.04. _Equity Awards; ESPP._ (a) (i) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company agrees that the Board of Directors of    ##### 

  

  

49  

the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock
Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions (but not
including the payment of any cash or non cash consideration without Parents
consent) as may be required to effect the following:     

 (A) each Stock Option that is vested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock lower than the Merger Consideration (each, a " _Vested In-the-Money Option_ ") (other than those granted under the ESPP) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (1) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Stock Option, multiplied by (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Stock Option; and such amount shall be paid promptly after the Closing (without interest), subject to applicable withholdings and deductions for taxes;    

 (B) each Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Vested In-the-Money Option, Affected Stock Option or option granted under the ESPP) (each, a " _Substituted Stock Option_ ") shall be converted into an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Substituted Stock Option, the number of shares of Parent common stock, par value $0.20 per share (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Substituted Stock Option by a fraction (the " _Option Exchange Ratio_ "), the numerator of which is the Merger Consideration and the denominator of which is the average closing price of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions Tape on the ten trading days immediately preceding the date on which the Effective Time occurs at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to (1) the per share exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Substituted Stock Option divided by (2) the Option Exchange Ratio (each, as so adjusted, an " _Adjusted Option_ "); _provided_ that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Substituted Stock Option that is intended to be an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code), and that may not be adjusted in the foregoing manner and remain an incentive stock option, shall be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code in a manner which most closely produces the economic results obtained with respect to other Adjusted Options (it being understood that it is the intention of the parties that Substituted Stock Options so assumed by Parent qualify, to the maximum extent permissible following the Effective Time, as "incentive    ##### 

  

  

50  

stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code), to the extent that
such Substituted Stock Options qualified as "incentive stock options" prior
to the Effective Time);    

 (C) each Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price of $4.00 or more per share of Company Common Stock (each, an " _Affected Stock Option_ ") (other than those granted under the ESPP) shall be terminated prior to the Effective Time by (A) providing timely notice (to allow for the termination of the Affected Stock Options prior to the Effective Time) to holders of Affected Stock Options that neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries shall assume such Affected Stock Options or substitute Parent options for such Affected Stock Options and (B) permitting holders of Affected Stock Options to exercise such Affected Stock Options during the applicable exercise period specified by the applicable Company Stock Plan (which, in each case, shall expire on the date that is no later than one day before the Effective Time) (the " _Exercise Period_ ");    

 (D) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, make such other changes to the Company Stock Plans as Parent and the Company may agree are appropriate to give effect to the Merger;    

 (E) take such action as necessary under the Company Stock Plans to ensure that all restrictions or limitations on transfer and vesting and all repurchase rights with respect to the Substituted Stock Options, to the extent that such restrictions or limitations shall not have already lapsed, and all other terms thereof, shall remain in full force and effect pursuant to their terms with respect to the corresponding Adjusted Options after giving effect to the Merger and the assumption by Parent as set forth below, subject to any acceleration of modification thereof pursuant to any Contract disclosed on Section 3.01(m) of the Company Disclosure Letter; and    

 (F) ensure that, after the Effective Time, no Stock Options, restricted stock rights, restricted stock or other awards based on the value of Company Common Stock may be granted under any Company Stock Plan or otherwise.    

 (ii) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need of any further corporate action, Parent shall assume the Company Stock Plans, with the result that all obligations of the Company under the Company Stock Plans, including with respect to Substituted Stock Options outstanding at the Effective Time, shall be obligations of Parent following the Effective Time. Parent may assume the Adjusted Options under an existing equity incentive plan of Parent.    ##### 

  

  

51 

 (iii) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall either (i) prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate form) registering a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares subject to the Adjusted Options or (ii) assume the Adjusted Options under an existing equity incentive plan with respect to which a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate form) is currently effective. Any such registration statement shall be kept effective (and the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses required thereby shall be maintained) as long as any Adjusted Options may remain outstanding.    

 (iv) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Adjusted Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the respective Company Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Adjusted Options and that such Adjusted Options and agreements shall be assumed by Parent and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 5.04 after giving effect to the Merger).

52 

 (b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.05.   

 (c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance covering each person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that Parent may substitute therefor policies of a reputable insurance company the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable to such directors and officers than the insurance coverage otherwise required under this Section 5.05(c); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to pay annualized aggregate premiums for insurance under this Section 5.05(c) in excess of 200% of the amount of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company for the period from August 20, 2004 to, and including, August 20, 2005 for such purpose (which premiums for such period are hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be $154,530); _provided_ that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such 200% amount.   

 (d) The provisions of this Section 5.05 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.   

 SECTION 5.06. _Fees and Expenses._ (a) Except as expressly set forth in this Section 5.06, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.   

 (b) In the event that (i) (A) a Takeover Proposal has been publicly proposed by any person (other than Parent or any of its affiliates) or any such person has publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to make a Takeover Proposal, or any such Takeover Proposal or intention otherwise becomes widely known to the stockholders of the Company, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) (but only if the Stockholders Meeting has not been held by the date that is five business days prior to the date of such termination) or 7.01(b)(iii) and (C) within 12 months after such termination, the Company or any of its subsidiaries enters into a definitive    ##### 

 

53 

 

agreement providing for, or consummates, any Takeover Proposal (solely for
purposes of this Section 5.06(b)(i)(C), the term "Takeover Proposal" shall
have the meaning set forth in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained
in Section 4.02(a) except that all references to 15% shall be deemed
references to 40%), (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.01(c) or (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to Section 7.01(f), then the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to
$6,800,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of same day funds to
an account designated by Parent (x) in the case of a termination by
Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c), within two business days after such
termination, (y) in the case of a termination by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.01(f), prior to or concurrently with such termination and (z) in
the case of a payment as a result of any event referred to in
Section 5.06(b)(i)(C), upon the first to occur of such events. The Company
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 5.06(b) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amounts due
pursuant to this Section 5.06(b), and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for
the amounts set forth in this Section 5.06(b), the Company shall pay to Parent
its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit and any appeal relating thereto, together with
interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 5.06(b) at the prime rate
of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made.    

 SECTION 5.07. _Benefits Matters._ Except as set forth below, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall honor, or cause to be honored, all obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under Benefit Agreements and Benefit Plans as of the Effective Time in accordance with the terms thereof. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating such Benefit Agreements and Benefit Plans in accordance with the terms thereof and with applicable Law.   

 SECTION 5.08. _Public Announcements._ Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall not issue any press release with respect to this Agreement, the Merger the Stockholders Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby without the consent of the other party, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system, in which circumstances reasonable efforts to consult with the other party will still be required to the extent practicable. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and all communications material to employees of the Company made on the day of the public announcement of the Merger shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties. Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with each other before making, and give each other a reasonable    ##### 

 

54 

 

opportunity to review and comment upon, any public statements (other than
press releases) with respect to this Agreement, the Merger, the Stockholders
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and
shall not make any such public statement prior to such reasonably practicable
consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither consent nor consultation shall be required if such
press release or public statement relates to an Adverse Recommendation
Change.    

 SECTION 5.09. _Sub Compliance_. Parent shall cause Sub to comply with all of Subs obligations under this Agreement. Sub shall not engage in any business other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

63  

representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any
action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and
certifications in this Section 8.10.    

 SECTION 8.11. _Enforcement._ The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any Delaware State court, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.    ##### 

  

   

64  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Sub and the Company have caused this Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized, all as of the date first written above.
