  |  

amend the Scheme;

Court Meeting or EGM (i) to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement or Form S-4 is
provided to the Warner Chilcott Shareholders or to permit dissemination of
information which is material to shareholders voting at the Court Meeting or
the EGM, but only for so long as the Warner Chilcott Board determines in good
faith, after having consulted with outside counsel, that such action is
reasonably necessary or advisable to give the Warner Chilcott Shareholders
sufficient time to evaluate any such disclosure or information so provided or
disseminated, or (ii) if as of the time the Court Meeting or EGM is scheduled
(as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement), there are insufficient Warner
Chilcott Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) (A) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Court Meeting or the EGM, but

3.6

  |  

Switching to a Takeover Offer

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(a)

  |  

In the event (and only in the event) that Actavis reasonably considers (in its
good faith discretion) that a competitive situation exists or, based on facts
known at the time, may reasonably be expected to arise in connection with the
Acquisition, Actavis may elect (and with the Panel's consent, if required) to
implement the Acquisition by way of the Takeover Offer (rather than the
Scheme), whether or not the Scheme Document has been posted, subject to the
terms of this Clause 3.6.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(b)

  |  

Save where there has been a Warner Chilcott Change of Recommendation, if
Actavis elects to implement the Acquisition by way of the Takeover Offer,
Warner Chilcott undertakes to provide Actavis as promptly as reasonably
practicable with all such information about the Warner Chilcott Group
(including directors and their connected persons) as may reasonably be
required for inclusion in the Takeover Offer Document and to provide all such
other assistance as may reasonably be required by the Takeover Rules in
connection with the preparation of the Takeover Offer Document, including
reasonable access to, and ensuring the provision of reasonable assistance by,
its management and relevant professional advisers.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(c)

  |  

If Actavis elects to implement the Acquisition by way of a Takeover Offer,
Warner Chilcott agrees:

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(i)

  |  

that the Takeover Offer Document will contain provisions in accordance with
the terms and conditions set out in the Rule 2.5 Announcement, the relevant
Conditions and such other further terms and conditions as agreed (including
any modification thereto) between Actavis and the Panel; provided, however,
that the terms and conditions of the Takeover Offer shall be at least as
favourable to the Warner Chilcott Shareholders (except for the 80 per cent
acceptance condition contemplated by Paragraph 9 of Part A of Appendix III to
the Rule 2.5 Announcement) and the holders of Warner Chilcott Options and
Warner Chilcott Share Awards and Warner Chilcott Employees as those which
would apply in relation to the Scheme;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(ii)

  |  

save where there has been a Warner Chilcott Change of Recommendation, to
reasonably co-operate and consult with Actavis in the preparation of the
Takeover Offer Document or any other document or filing which is required for
the purposes of implementing the Acquisition;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(iii)

  |  

that, subject to the obligations of the Warner Chilcott Board under the
Takeover Rules, and unless the Warner Chilcott Board determines in good faith
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors
that, to do otherwise, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties of the directors of Warner Chilcott or the Takeover
Rules, the Takeover Offer shall incorporate a recommendation to the holders of
the Warner Chilcott Shares from the Warner Chilcott Board to accept the
Takeover Offer, and such recommendation will not be withdrawn, adversely
modified or qualified except as contemplated by Clause 5.3.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(d)

  |  

Save where there has been a Warner Chilcott Change of Recommendation, if
Actavis elects to implement the Acquisition by way of the Takeover Offer in
accordance with Clause 3.6(a), the Parties mutually agree:

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

  

  

     |  

(i)

  |  

to prepare and file with, or submit to, the SEC all documents, amendments and
supplements required to be filed therewith or submitted thereto pursuant to
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act in connection with the Takeover Offer,
and each Party shall have reasonable opportunities to review and make comments
on all such documents, amendments and supplements and, following accommodation
of such comments and approval of such documents, amendments and supplements by
the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, file or submit, as the case may be, such documents, amendments and
supplements with or to the SEC;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(ii)

  |  

to provide the other Party with any comments received from the SEC on any
documents filed by it with the SEC promptly after receipt thereof; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(iii)

  |  

to provide the other Party with reasonable prior notice of any proposed oral
communication with the SEC and afford the other Party reasonable opportunity
to participate therein.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(e)

  |  

If the Takeover Offer is consummated, Actavis shall cause Holdco to effect as
promptly as reasonably practicable a compulsory acquisition of any Warner
Chilcott Shares under section 204 of the Act not acquired in the Takeover
Offer for the same consideration per share.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(f)

  |  

For the avoidance of doubt and except as may be required by the Takeover Rules
(and without limiting any other provision of this Agreement), nothing in this
Clause 3.6 shall require Warner Chilcott to provide Actavis with any
information with respect to, or to otherwise take or fail to take any action
in connection with Warner Chilcott's consideration of or response to, any
Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal.

   
---|---|---

"Joint Proxy Statement") and (ii) a registration statement on Form S-4 (of
which the Joint Proxy Statement will form a part) with respect to the issuance
of Holdco Shares in respect of the Scheme and Merger (the "Form S-4"). Each of
the Parties shall use all reasonable endeavours to have the Joint Proxy
Statement cleared by the SEC and the Form S-4 to be declared effective by the
SEC, to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Acquisition and the Merger, and to mail the Joint Proxy Statement to their
respective shareholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective, to the extent required by applicable Law.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

Each of the Parties shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof,
provide the other with copies of any written comments and advise the other
Party of any oral comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement or the
Form S-4 received from the SEC. Each Party shall cooperate and provide the
other Party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 prior to
filing such with the SEC, and each Party will promptly provide the other

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Party with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Each Party shall use
all reasonable endeavours to take any action required to be taken by it under
any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the Acquisition or the
Merger, and each Party shall furnish all information concerning it and the
holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with
any such action. Each Party will advise the other Party, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective,
the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the
Holdco Shares issuable in connection with the Acquisition and the Merger for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment
of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4. If, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, any information relating to any of the Parties, or their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by either
Party, and such information should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 so that such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Party and, to the extent required
by Law an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminated to the Warner Chilcott Shareholders and the Actavis Shareholders.

  

  

     |  

(b)

  |  

Actavis shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of the Actavis Shareholders (the "Actavis Shareholders
Meeting") as promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Form
S-4 becomes effective for the purpose of obtaining the approval of this
Agreement by the holders of Actavis Shares as required by the NGCL and Article
I of the Actavis Bylaws and to approve the Actavis Distributable Reserves
Resolution (the "Actavis Shareholder Approval"). Save as required by Law,
Actavis shall not adjourn or postpone the Actavis Shareholders Meeting after
filing of the Form S-4 without the consent of Warner Chilcott (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, however,
that Actavis may, without the consent of Warner Chilcott, adjourn or postpone
the Actavis Shareholders Meeting (i) to the extent reasonably necessary to
ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement
or Form-S-4 is provided to the Actavis Shareholders or to permit dissemination
of information which is material to shareholders voting at the Actavis
Shareholders Meeting, but only for so long as the Actavis Board determines in
good faith, after having consulted with outside counsel, that such action is
reasonably necessary or advisable to give the Actavis Shareholders sufficient
time to evaluate any such disclosure or information so provided or
disseminated, or (ii) if as of the time the Actavis Shareholders Meeting is
scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement), there are insufficient
Actavis Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) (A) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Actavis Shareholders Meeting,
but only until a meeting can be held at which there are a sufficient number of
Actavis Shares represented to constitute a quorum or (B) voting for the
Actavis Shareholder Approval, but only until a meeting can be held at which
there are a sufficient number of votes of holders of Actavis Shares to obtain
the Actavis Shareholder Approval. Subject to Clause 5.4, Actavis shall (i) use
all reasonable endeavours to obtain from the Actavis Shareholders the Actavis
Shareholder Approval and (ii) through the Actavis Board, make the Actavis
Recommendation to the Actavis Shareholders and include the Actavis
Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement. Unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with Clause 9, this Agreement shall be submitted to
the Actavis Shareholders at the Actavis Shareholders Meeting for the

   
---|---|---

purpose of obtaining the Actavis Shareholder Approval, and nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to relieve Actavis of such obligation.

  

  

     |  

(c)

  |  

Actavis shall, prior to the Actavis Shareholders Meeting, keep Warner Chilcott
reasonably informed in the two (2) weeks prior to the Actavis Shareholders
Meeting of the number of proxy votes received in respect of matters to be
acted upon at the Actavis Shareholders Meeting, and in any event shall provide
such number promptly upon the request of Warner Chilcott or its
Representatives.

Holdco and converted into an option to acquire, on the same terms and

prior to the Effective Time, a number of Holdco Shares determined by
multiplying the number of Warner Chilcott Shares subject to the Warner
Chilcott Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole share (any Fractional Entitlements shall be

determined by dividing the per share exercise price of such Warner Chilcott
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded

Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share
(any Fractional Entitlements shall be treated in accordance with Clause 4.7);
provided, however, that to the extent that any Warner Chilcott Share Award

vested immediately prior to the Effective Time and, by virtue of the
occurrence of the Effective Time and pursuant to the Scheme and without any
action on the part of the holder of such Warner Chilcott Share Award, be
converted into the right to receive from Holdco the Scheme Consideration in
accordance with Clause 8.1(c)(i), less the Applicable Withholding Amount, no
later than seven calendar days following the Effective Date.

  

  

For any performance-based Warner Chilcott Share Award covered by this Clause

Warner Chilcott shall procure that a special resolution be put before the

Association of Warner Chilcott be amended so that any Warner Chilcott Shares
allotted following the EGM will either be subject to the terms of the Scheme
or acquired by Holdco for the same consideration per Warner Chilcott Share as
shall be payable to Warner Chilcott Shareholders under the Scheme (depending
upon the timing of such allotment); provided, however that nothing in such
amendment to the Articles of Association shall prohibit the sale (whether on a
stock exchange or otherwise) of any Warner Chilcott Shares issued on the
exercise of Warner Chilcott Options or vesting or settlement of Warner
Chilcott Share Awards, as applicable, following the EGM but prior to the
sanction of the Scheme by the High Court, it being always acknowledged that

Non-Solicitation Applicable to Warner Chilcott

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(a)

  |  

Subject to any actions which Warner Chilcott is required to take so as to
comply with the requirements of the Takeover Rules, Warner Chilcott agrees
that neither it nor any Subsidiary of Warner Chilcott shall, and that it shall
use all reasonable endeavours to cause its and their respective
Representatives and any person Acting in Concert with Warner Chilcott not to,
directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any
enquiry with respect to, or the making or submission of, any Warner Chilcott
Alternative Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding a Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal with, or furnish any
nonpublic information regarding a Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal to, any
person that has made or, to Warner Chilcott's knowledge, is considering making
a Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal, except to notify such person as to the
existence of the provisions of this Clause 5.3, or (iii) waive, terminate,
modify or fail to use reasonable endeavours to enforce any provision of any
"standstill" or similar obligation of any person with respect to Warner
Chilcott or any of its Subsidiaries (provided that Warner Chilcott shall not
be required to take, or be prohibited from taking, any action otherwise
prohibited or required by this subclause (iii) if the Warner Chilcott Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with Warner Chilcott's legal
advisors) that such action or inaction would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law).
Warner Chilcott shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore
with respect to any Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal, or any enquiry or
proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Warner Chilcott
Alternative Proposal, request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished in connection therewith and
immediately terminate all physical and electronic dataroom access previously
granted to any such person or its Representatives.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(b)

  |  

Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Clause 5.3(a), if Warner Chilcott
receives a bona fide written Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal or enquiry
or proposal from a person who is intending on making a Warner Chilcott
Alternative Proposal and the Warner Chilcott Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with Warner Chilcott's financial advisors and legal
counsel) that the failure to take the actions described in clauses (x) and (y)
below would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the director's
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and which Warner Chilcott Alternative
Proposal, enquiry or proposal was made after the date of this Agreement and
did not otherwise result from a breach of this Clause 5.3, Warner Chilcott may
take any or all of the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to
the third party (and any persons working in concert with such third party and
to their respective potential financing sources and Representatives) making or
intending to make such Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal (provided that all
such information has previously been provided to Actavis or is provided to
Actavis substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such
person(s)), if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, Warner
Chilcott receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement
on terms no less restrictive of such person than the Confidentiality Agreement
and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party with
respect to such Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal. Warner Chilcott will
promptly (and in any event within 24

  

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

  

hours of receipt) notify Actavis orally and in writing of the receipt of any
Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal or any communication or proposal that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal and
shall, in the case of any such notice to Actavis as to receipt of a Warner
Chilcott Alternative Proposal, indicate the material terms and conditions of
such Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal or such communication or proposal
(including any changes to such material terms and conditions) and the identity
of the person making any such Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal and
thereafter shall promptly keep Actavis reasonably informed on a reasonably
current basis of any material change to the terms and status of any such
Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal. Warner Chilcott shall provide to Actavis
as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt or delivery thereof (and in
any event within 24 hours of receipt or delivery) copies of all written
correspondence and other written material exchanged between Warner Chilcott or
any of its Subsidiaries and the person making a Warner Chilcott Alternative
Proposal (or such person's Representatives) that describes any of the material
terms or conditions of such Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal, including
draft agreements or term sheets submitted by either party in connection
therewith. Warner Chilcott shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
enter into any confidentiality agreement with any person subsequent to the
date of this Agreement that prohibits Warner Chilcott from providing such
information to Actavis.

  

  

     |  

(c)

  |  

Except as set forth in Clauses 5.3(d), (e) and (f) below, neither the Warner
Chilcott Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in
any manner adverse to Actavis), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in
any manner adverse to Actavis), the Scheme Recommendation or (B) approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or
declare advisable, any Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal (any action in
this subclause (i) being referred to as a "Warner Chilcott Change of
Recommendation") (it being agreed that (x) no "stop, look and listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act in and of itself
shall constitute a Warner Chilcott Change of Recommendation and (y) for the
avoidance of doubt, the provision by Warner Chilcott to Actavis of notice or
information in connection with a Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal or
Warner Chilcott Superior Proposal as required or expressly permitted by this
Agreement shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Warner Chilcott Change of
Recommendation) or (ii) cause or allow Warner Chilcott or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, transaction agreement, implementation agreement, option agreement,
joint venture agreement, alliance agreement, partnership agreement or other
agreement constituting or with respect to, or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal, or requiring,
or reasonably expected to cause, Warner Chilcott to abandon, terminate, delay
or fail to consummate the Acquisition (other than as contemplated by Clause
5.3(i)(i) and other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Clause
5.3(b)).

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(d)

  |  

Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Warner Chilcott
Board, at any time prior to obtaining the Warner Chilcott Shareholder
Approval, from making a Warner Chilcott Change of Recommendation if the Warner
Chilcott Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with Warner
Chilcott's outside legal counsel and financial advisors) (i) that a Warner
Chilcott Alternative Proposal constitutes a Warner Chilcott Superior Proposal
and (ii) that the failure to make a Warner Chilcott Change of Recommendation
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that Warner Chilcott shall

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  

  

have provided prior written notice to Actavis, at least three Business Days in
advance, of the Warner Chilcott Board's intention to make such Warner Chilcott
Change of Recommendation, and provided, further, that the Warner Chilcott
Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement and
the Scheme proposed by Actavis in response to such prior written notice or
otherwise, and during such three Business Day period Warner Chilcott shall
engage in good faith negotiations with Actavis regarding any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Actavis.

  

  

     |  

(e)

  |  

Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Warner Chilcott
Board, in response to an Intervening Event, from making a Warner Chilcott
Change of Recommendation at any time prior to obtaining the Warner Chilcott
Shareholder Approval if the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however,
that Warner Chilcott shall have provided prior written notice to Actavis, at
least three Business Days in advance, of the Warner Chilcott Board's intention
to make such Warner Chilcott Change of Recommendation, and provided, further,
that the Warner Chilcott Board shall take into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement and the Scheme proposed by Actavis in response to such
prior written notice or otherwise, and during such three Business Day period
Warner Chilcott shall engage in good faith negotiations with Actavis regarding
any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Actavis.
Notwithstanding any Warner Chilcott Change of Recommendation, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Clause 9, Warner Chilcott
shall hold the Court Meeting and the EGM in accordance with Clause 3.1 for
purposes of obtaining the approval of the Resolutions by the requisite
majorities of Warner Chilcott Shareholders, and nothing contained herein shall
be deemed to relieve Warner Chilcott of such obligation.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(f)

  |  

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict Warner Chilcott
or the Warner Chilcott Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the Warner
Chilcott Shareholders a position or making a statement contemplated by Rule
14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or other applicable Law, or (ii) making any disclosure to the
Warner Chilcott Shareholders if in the good faith judgment of the Warner
Chilcott Board (after consultation with Warner Chilcott's outside legal
advisors), failure to so disclose and/or take would be reasonably likely to
give rise to a violation of applicable Law; provided, however, that any
disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act that relates to the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Warner Chilcott Board
with respect to this Agreement or a Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal shall
be deemed to be a Warner Chilcott Change of Recommendation unless Warner
Chilcott in connection with such disclosure publicly states that the Warner
Chilcott Board expressly rejects the applicable Warner Chilcott Alternative
Proposal, expressly states that its recommendation with respect to this
Agreement has not changed or refers to the prior recommendation of the Warner
Chilcott Board, without disclosing any Warner Chilcott Change of
Recommendation.

As used in this Agreement, "Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal" shall mean
any bona fide proposal or bona fide offer made by any person (other than a
proposal or offer by Actavis or any of its Associates or any person Acting in
Concert with Actavis pursuant to Rule 2.5 of the Takeover Rules) for (i) the
acquisition of Warner Chilcott by scheme of arrangement, takeover offer or
business combination transaction; (ii) the acquisition by any person of 25% or
more of the assets of Warner Chilcott and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
measured by either book value or fair market value (including equity
securities

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

of Warner Chilcott's Subsidiaries); (iii) the acquisition by any person (or
the stockholders of any person) of 25% or more of the outstanding Warner
Chilcott Shares; or (iv) any merger, business combination, consolidation,
share exchange, recapitalisation or similar transaction involving Warner
Chilcott as a result of which the holders of Warner Chilcott Shares
immediately prior to such transaction do not, in the aggregate, own at least
75% of the outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity in
such transaction immediately after consummation thereof.

  

  

     |  

(h)

  |  

As used in this Agreement "Warner Chilcott Superior Proposal" shall mean a
written bona fide Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal made by any person that
the Warner Chilcott Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
Warner Chilcott's financial advisors and legal counsel) is more favourable to
the Warner Chilcott Shareholders than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, taking into account such financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such proposal as the Warner Chilcott Board considers to be
appropriate (it being understood that, for purposes of the definition of
"Warner Chilcott Superior Proposal", references to "25%" and "75%" in the
definition of Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to refer to
"50%").

The Parties agree that:

(i)

  |  

Warner Chilcott may terminate this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining
the Warner Chilcott Shareholder Approval, in order to enter into any
agreement, understanding or arrangement providing for a Warner Chilcott
Superior Proposal, provided that (x) promptly upon the Warner Chilcott Board's
determination that a Warner Chilcott Superior Proposal exists (and in any
event, within twenty-four (24) hours of such determination) Warner Chilcott
has provided a written notice to Actavis (a "Warner Chilcott Superior Proposal
Notice") advising Actavis that Warner Chilcott has received a Warner Chilcott
Alternative Proposal and specifying the information with respect thereto
required by Clause 5.3(b) and including written notice of the determination of
the Warner Chilcott Board that the Warner Chilcott Alternative Proposal
constitutes a Warner Chilcott Superior Proposal, (y) Warner Chilcott has
provided Actavis with an opportunity, for a period of three Business Days from
the time of delivery to Actavis of the Warner Chilcott Superior Proposal
Notice (as may be extended pursuant to the proviso below, the "Actavis Notice
Period"), to propose to amend (the "Actavis Right to Match") the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Acquisition, including an increase in, or
modification of, the Scheme Consideration (any such proposed transaction, a
"Actavis Revised Acquisition"), such that the Warner Chilcott Superior
Proposal no longer constitutes a Warner Chilcott Superior Proposal, and (z) at
the end of such Actavis Notice Period, the Warner Chilcott Board has
determined that the Warner Chilcott Superior Proposal continues to be a Warner
Chilcott Superior Proposal notwithstanding the Actavis Revised Acquisition and
taking into account all amendments and proposed changes made thereto during
the Actavis Notice Period. In the event that during the Actavis Notice Period
any material revision is made to the financial terms of the Warner Chilcott
Superior Proposal, Warner Chilcott shall be required, upon each such revision,
to deliver a new Warner Chilcott Superior Proposal Notice to Actavis and to
comply with the requirements of this Clause 5.3(i)(i) with respect to such new
Warner Chilcott Superior Proposal Notice, except that the Actavis Notice
Period shall be the greater of 24 hours and the amount of time remaining in
the initial Actavis Notice Period; and

in the event that a competitive situation arises pursuant to Rule 31.4 of the
Takeover Rules in relation to Actavis and a third party or parties, Warner
Chilcott shall use reasonable endeavours to obtain permission from the Panel
to provide that the auction procedure determined by the Panel shall give
effect to and be consistent with Actavis's rights and the obligations of
Warner Chilcott and the Warner Chilcott Board pursuant to this Clause 5.3(i),
and Warner Chilcott shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, keep Actavis
reasonably informed of any discussions with the Panel in respect of the
determination of such auction procedure.

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict Actavis or the

position or making a statement contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or other
applicable Law, or (ii) making any disclosure to the Actavis Shareholders if
in the good faith judgment of the Actavis Board (after consultation with
Actavis's outside legal advisors), failure to so disclose and/or take would be
reasonably likely to give rise to a violation of applicable Law; provided,
however, that any disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act that relates to the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Actavis Board with
respect to this Agreement or an Actavis Alternative Proposal shall be deemed
to be an Actavis Change of Recommendation unless Actavis in connection with
such disclosure publicly states that the Actavis Board expressly rejects the
applicable Actavis Alternative Proposal, expressly states that its
recommendation with respect to this Agreement has not changed or refers to the
prior recommendation of the Actavis Board, without disclosing any Actavis
Change of Recommendation.

person) of 25% or more of the outstanding Actavis Shares; or (iv) any merger,
business combination, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalisation or

financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal as the Actavis
Board considers to be appropriate (it being understood that, for purposes of

hereof (but excluding any forward looking disclosures set forth in any "risk
factors" section, any disclosures in any "forward looking statements" section
and any other disclosures included therein to the extent they are predictive
or forward-looking in nature) or in the applicable section of the disclosure
schedule delivered by Warner Chilcott to Actavis immediately prior to the

as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing

operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organised, validly existing,

the FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Department of
Health and Human Services, of noncompliance by, or liability of Actavis or the

     |  

(v)

  |  

Since January 1, 2011, neither Actavis nor any of the Actavis Subsidiaries has
received any written notice from the FDA or the EMA or any foreign agency with
jurisdiction over the marketing, sale, use handling and control, safety,

fact required to be disclosed to the FDA or

   
---|---|---

any other Actavis Regulatory Agency, or committed an act, made a statement, or
failed to make a statement, in each such case, related to the business of
Actavis or any of the Actavis Subsidiaries, that, at the time such disclosure
was made, would reasonably be expected to provide a basis for the FDA to
invoke its policy respecting "Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts,
Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities", set forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September
10, 1991) or for the FDA or any other Actavis Regulatory Agency to invoke any

Subsidiaries, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have an Actavis Material Adverse Effect, each such
Actavis Product or Actavis Product candidate is being or has been developed,
manufactured, stored, distributed and marketed in compliance with all
applicable Laws, including those relating to investigational use, marketing
approval, current good manufacturing practices, packaging, labeling,
advertising, record keeping, reporting, and security. There is no action or
proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Actavis, threatened, including any
prosecution, injunction, seizure, civil fine, debarment, suspension or recall,
in each case alleging any violation applicable to any Actavis Product or
Actavis Product candidate by Actavis or any of the Actavis Subsidiaries of any
Law, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be

market withdrawal or replacement, safety alert, warning, "dear doctor" letter,
investigator notice, or other notice or action to wholesalers, distributors,
retailers, healthcare professionals or patients relating to an alleged lack of
safety, efficacy or regulatory compliance of any Actavis Product. To the
Knowledge of Actavis, there are no facts which are reasonably likely to cause,

Actavis Regulatory Agency regarding (i) the recall, market withdrawal or
replacement of any Warner Chilcott Product sold or intended to be sold by

As of the date hereof, no member of the Actavis Group is a party to, or bound

binding understanding with a labour union or labour organisation. No member of
the Actavis Group is subject to a labour dispute, strike or work stoppage

materialmen's, repairmen's or other similar lien arising in the ordinary
course of business, (C) which is disclosed on the most recent consolidated
balance sheet of Actavis or notes thereto or securing liabilities reflected on
such balance sheet, (D) which was incurred in the ordinary course of business
since the date of the most recent consolidated balance sheet of Actavis or (E)
which would not reasonably be expected to materially impair the continued use

nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of any pending, and to the

and in full force and effect and (B) no uncured default of a material nature
on the part of Actavis or, if applicable, its Subsidiary or, to the knowledge

Neither Actavis nor any Subsidiary of Actavis is in breach of or default under

Subsidiaries are in full force and effect and are valid and enforceable and
cover against the risks as are customary in all material respects for

     |  

(a)

  |  

Each of Warner Chilcott and Actavis shall afford the other Party and such
other Party's Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours,
throughout the period from the release of the Rule 2.5 Announcement until the
earlier of the Effective Time and the date, if any, on which the Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Clause 9, to its and its Subsidiaries' properties,
employees, contracts, commitments, books and records, financial and operating
data, any report, schedule or other document filed or received by it pursuant
to the requirements of applicable Laws for purposes of integration planning.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Warner Chilcott nor Actavis shall be
required to afford such access if it would unreasonably disrupt the operations
of such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, would cause a violation of any
agreement to which such Party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, would
cause a risk of a loss of privilege to such Party or any of its Subsidiaries
or would constitute a violation of any applicable Law (provided that the
withholding Party shall use its reasonable endeavours to cause such
information to be provided in a manner that would not result in such violation
or loss of privilege). If any material is withheld by a Party pursuant to the
preceding sentence, such Party shall (subject to the preceding sentence)
inform the other Party as to the general nature of what is being withheld.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(b)

  |  

The Parties hereby agree that all information provided to them or their
respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be
Evaluation Material, as such term is used in, and shall be treated in
accordance with, the Confidentiality Agreement.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(c)

  |  

The Parties agree that, prior to Completion:

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(i) Warner Chilcott shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and shall direct
its Representatives to, promptly, and in any event within three (3) Business
Days, remit to the General Counsel of Actavis all significant mail,
correspondence, notices, filings, records, documentation or other written (or
descriptions of material oral) communications received by them relating to the
Specified Matters;

  

  

(ii) Warner Chilcott shall keep Actavis reasonably informed of all material
changes or developments with respect to the Specified Matters, including
without limitation any settlement related discussions, and to promptly provide
any information reasonably requested by Actavis in relation to the Specified
Matters;

  

  

(iii) to the extent permissible, Actavis shall be entitled, at its sole cost
and expense, to participate in and consult in good faith with respect to all
significant actions, decisions (including the bringing of claims or counter-
claims and the entry into settlements) and negotiations relating to the
Specified Matters and the defense thereof, including in connection with
sending notices or executing documentation (including dispute or objection
notices, settlements, pleadings or other documentation), and otherwise in
defending the Specified Matters, and Warner Chilcott shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and shall direct its Representatives to, reasonably cooperate
and consult with Actavis in connection with the foregoing, provided that to
the extent (and solely to such extent) it is not practicable to comply with
the foregoing due to exigent

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

 

  

  

circumstances Warner Chilcott shall instead promptly inform Actavis of any
such actions, decisions or negotiations;

  

  

(iv) Actavis shall have the right to review, consent to and approve (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) any
significant decisions with respect to the defense of the Specified Matter and
any Actions related thereto, including, without limitation, any discussions
relating to the settlement of the Specified Matters; and

  

  

(v) in furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, in no event will
Warner Chilcott consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Specified Matters without the prior written
consent of Actavis which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed (it being agreed that any refusal to provide consent
due to material restrictions upon the businesses of Holdco from and after
Completion shall not be deemed unreasonable);

  

  

provided, that nothing in this Section 7.1(c) shall require Warner Chilcott or
any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives to share any information or take
any action to the extent (but solely to such extent) in the opinion of outside
counsel to Warner Chilcott (following consultation with outside counsel for
Actavis) (1) the joint defense privilege is not reasonably likely to apply,
and (2) such action is reasonably likely to cause a risk of a loss of the
protections of the attorney client privilege, work-product doctrine or other
similar privilege or could constitute a violation of any applicable Law.

---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(c)

  |  

Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Warner Chilcott, Actavis and each

  |

in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Acquisition);

   
---|---|---

Business Days after the date hereof (or later if mutually agreed by the
Parties), (B) under any other Antitrust Laws or foreign investment Laws, (C)
under the Takeover Rules and the Act or (D) as required by the High Court; and

  

  

     |  

(iv)

  |  

as promptly as reasonably practicable, take reasonable actions to obtain from,
make with or provide to any third party any Clearances required to be
obtained, made or provided by Warner Chilcott or Actavis or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Acquisition); provided,
however, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in
no event shall Warner Chilcott or Actavis or any of their respective
Subsidiaries be required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any fee, penalty
or other consideration to any third party for any Clearance required in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Acquisition) under any contract or agreement.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(d)

  |  

Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, including Clause 7.2(h), each of
the Parties agrees, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to
cooperate and to use all reasonable endeavours to (i) obtain any Clearances
required in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Acquisition) under the HSR Act and any other federal,
state or foreign Law designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for
the purpose or effect of monopolisation or restraint of trade (collectively,
"Antitrust Laws"), and (ii) respond to any requests of any Relevant Authority
for information or documentary material under any Antitrust Law, and to
contest and resist any action, including any legislative, administrative or
judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the
Acquisition or the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any Antitrust Law (an "Antitrust Order"), provided that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Actavis
shall, on behalf of the Parties, control and lead all communications and
strategy relating to the Antitrust Laws (provided that Warner Chilcott is not
constrained from complying with applicable Law), provided, further, that the
Parties shall consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good
faith the views of one another, regarding the form and content of any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of either Party in connection
with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law prior to their
submission.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(e)

  |  

Subject to the provisos in Clause 7.2(d), Actavis and Warner Chilcott shall
(i) promptly advise each other of (and Actavis or Warner Chilcott shall so
advise with respect to communications received by any Subsidiary of Actavis or
Warner Chilcott, as the case may be) any written or oral communication from
any Relevant Authority or third party whose Clearance is required or
reasonably necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Acquisition); (ii) not
participate in any meeting or discussion with any Relevant Authority in
respect of any filing, investigation, or enquiry concerning this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the
other Party in advance, and, unless prohibited by such Relevant Authority,
gives the other Party the opportunity to attend; and (iii) promptly furnish
the other Party with copies of all

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

  

  

correspondence, filings, and written communications between them and their
Subsidiaries and Representatives, on the one hand, and any Relevant Authority
or its respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that materials may be
redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the businesses
of Warner Chilcott or Actavis or their respective Affiliates, (y) as necessary
to comply with contractual arrangements, and (z) as necessary to address
reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns. Actavis shall not consent to
any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any
voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at the behest of any Relevant Authority without considering in good
faith the views of Warner Chilcott and Warner Chilcott shall not consent to
any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any
voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at the behest of any Relevant Authority without the consent of
Actavis, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. With respect to any notice, documentation or other communication
required to be given by either Party to the other Party pursuant to this
Clause 7.2(e), such first Party may give such notice, documentation or other
communication to such second Party's outside counsel, instead of directly to
such second Party, if such first Party reasonably believes that doing so is
required by, or advisable pursuant to, applicable Law.

  

  

     |  

(f)

  |  

Each Party will provide as promptly as practicable such information and
documentary material as may be requested by a Relevant Authority following any
such filing or notification and shall negotiate with any Relevant Authority in
relation to any undertakings, orders, agreements or commitments which any such
Relevant Authority requires to facilitate the Acquisition and the Merger.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(g)

  |  

In the event that the latest date on which the High Court and/or the Panel
would permit Completion to occur is prior to the date that is one year after
the date of this Agreement, the Parties shall use all reasonable endeavours to
obtain consent of the High Court and/or the Panel, as applicable, to an
extension of such latest date (but not beyond the date that is one year after
the date of this Agreement). If (i) the High Court and/or the Panel require
the lapsing of the Scheme prior to the date that is one year after the date of
this Agreement, (ii) the Scheme lapses pursuant to Rule 12(b)(i) of the
Takeover Rules, (iii) Condition 1 fails to be satisfied or (iv) the Scheme
lapses pursuant to paragraph 7 of Annex I to the Rule 2.5 Announcement as a
result of the Scheme failing to have become effective on or prior to the date
that is one year after the date of this Agreement, the Parties shall (unless
and until this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Clause 9) take all actions
required in order to re-initiate the Scheme process as promptly as reasonably
practicable (it being understood that no such lapsing described in sub-clause
(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) shall, in and of itself, result in a termination of,
or otherwise affect any rights or obligations of any Party under, this
Agreement).

(h)

  |  

In furtherance and not in limitation of the other covenants contained in this
Clause 7.2, Actavis and Warner Chilcott agree to take, or cause to be taken
(including by its Subsidiaries), any and all steps and to make, or cause to be
made (including by its Subsidiaries), any and all undertakings necessary to
resolve such objections, if any, that a Relevant Authority may assert under
any Antitrust Law with respect to the Acquisition or the Merger, and to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be
asserted by any Relevant Authority with respect to the Acquisition or the
Merger, in each case, so as to enable the Completion to occur as promptly as

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

77  

  

 

 

 

  

  

practicable, including (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of any businesses, assets, equity interests,
product lines or properties of Actavis or Warner Chilcott (or any of their
respective Subsidiaries) or any equity interest in any joint venture held by
Actavis or Warner Chilcott (or any of their respective Subsidiaries), (y)
creating, terminating, or divesting relationships, ventures, contractual
rights or obligations of Actavis or Warner Chilcott or their respective
Subsidiaries and (z) otherwise taking or committing to take any action that
would limit Actavis's freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets, equity
interests, product lines or properties of Actavis or Warner Chilcott
(including any of their respective Subsidiaries) or any equity interest in any
joint venture held by Actavis or Warner Chilcott (or any of their respective
Subsidiaries), in each case as may be required in order to obtain all
Clearances required directly or indirectly under any Antitrust Law or to avoid
the commencement of any action to prohibit the Acquisition or the Merger under
any Antitrust Law, or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any action or
proceeding seeking to prohibit the Acquisition or the Merger or delay
Completion beyond the End Date. To assist Actavis in complying with its
obligations set forth in this Clause 7.2, Warner Chilcott shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into one or more agreements requested by
Actavis to be entered into by any of them prior to the Completion with respect
to any transaction to divest, hold separate or otherwise take any action that
limits Warner Chilcott's or its Subsidiaries' freedom of action, ownership or
control with respect to, or their ability to retain or hold, directly or
indirectly, any of the businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or
properties of Warner Chilcott or any of its Subsidiaries or any equity
interest in any joint venture held by Warner Chilcott or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, a "Divestiture Action"); provided, however, that the
consummation of the transactions provided for in any such agreement for a
Divestiture Action shall be conditioned upon the Completion. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Clause 7.2 shall
require, or be deemed to require, Actavis or Warner Chilcott (or any of their
respective Subsidiaries) to take any action, agree to take any action or
consent to the taking of any action (including with respect to selling,
holding separate or otherwise disposing of any business or assets or
conducting its (or its Subsidiaries) or, following consummation of the
Acquisition and the Merger, Holdco's, business in any specified manner) if
doing so would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a material adverse effect on the business, operations or financial
condition of Holdco (following consummation of the Acquisition and the
Merger).

may have under the Organisational Documents of Warner Chilcott or any of its
Subsidiaries or the Organisational Documents of Actavis or any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, any agreement, any insurance policy, the Act (or

shall survive the consummation of the Acquisition and the Merger and shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party without the written consent of such affected Indemnified
Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall be third
party beneficiaries of this Clause 7.3 and shall be entitled to enforce the

Employment and Benefit Matters

     |  

(a)

  |  

For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Holdco shall provide,
or shall cause to be provided, to each Warner Chilcott Employee (i) base
compensation that is no less favourable to such Warner Chilcott Employee than
the base compensation provided to such Warner Chilcott Employee prior to the
Effective Time; (ii) a cash bonus opportunity in accordance with the Bonus
Opportunity set forth in Section 7.4(a) of the Warner Chilcott Disclosure
Schedule; and (iii) other compensation opportunities and benefits (excluding
severance benefits) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate,
either (A) to those generally made available to similarly situated Actavis
employees under Holdco's and Actavis's compensation and benefit plans and
programs, or (B) to those provided to such Warner Chilcott Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Further, and notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Holdco shall provide, or
shall cause to be provided, during the 18-month period following the Effective
Time, severance benefits in accordance with the Severance Benefits Formula set
forth in Section 7.4(a) of the Warner Chilcott Disclosure Schedule, giving
full credit for each Warner Chilcott Employee's length of all service with the
Warner Chilcott Group and its predecessors prior to the Effective Time and all
service with Holdco and its Affiliates following the Effective Time.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(b)

  |  

For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits
under the employee benefit plans of Holdco and Actavis providing benefits to
any Warner Chilcott Employee after the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), each
Warner Chilcott Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service
with the Warner Chilcott Group and its predecessors before the Effective Time,
to the same extent as such Warner Chilcott Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Warner Chilcott
Benefit Plan in which such Warner Chilcott Employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that
the foregoing shall not apply with respect to any benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(i) each Warner Chilcott Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Warner
Chilcott Benefit Plan in which such Warner Chilcott Employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old
Plans"), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits (but not including any disability
benefits) to any Warner Chilcott Employee, Holdco shall use reasonable
endeavours to cause (1) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or
her covered dependents, unless and to the extent the individual, immediately
prior to entry in the New Plans, was subject to such conditions under the
comparable Old Plans, and (2) any eligible expenses incurred by such employee
and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the
Old Plan ending on the date such employee's participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

Holdco and Actavis hereby acknowledge that a "change of control" (or similar
phrase) for the purpose of each Warner Chilcott Benefit Plan set forth on
Schedule 7.4(c) will occur at or immediately prior to the Effective Time.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(d)

  |  

Actavis and Warner Chilcott shall cooperate in respect of consultation
obligations and similar notice and bargaining obligations owed to any
employees or consultants of Warner Chilcott or any Subsidiary of Warner
Chilcott in accordance with all applicable Laws and bargaining agreements, if
any.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(e)

  |  

Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Warner Chilcott Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Holdco or Actavis or any
Affiliate of Actavis, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of Holdco or Actavis or any Affiliate of Actavis, which rights are
hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any
Warner Chilcott Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, and without narrowing the provisions of Clause 10.14, nothing in
this Clause 7.4 shall (x) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or other
modification of any Warner Chilcott Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of
Holdco, Actavis, or (y) create any third party rights in any current or former
service provider or employee of Holdco, Actavis, Warner Chilcott or any of
their respective Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

Prior to the Effective Time, and, if the tax opinion of Davis Polk and Wardwell
LLP referred to in Clause 7.5(b) below is obtained, following the Effective
Time, none of Actavis, Holdco, Warner Chilcott or any of their Subsidiaries
shall with knowledge take or omit to take any action if such action or failure
to act would be reasonably likely to prevent or impede the receipt of the
Scheme Consideration in exchange for the Warner Chilcott Shares pursuant to
the Scheme from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. Prior to the Effective Time, Actavis, Holdco, Warner
Chilcott and their respective Subsidiaries shall use all reasonable endeavours
to take or cause to be taken any action necessary for the receipt of the
Scheme Consideration in exchange for the Warner Chilcott Shares pursuant to
the Scheme to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. If the tax opinion of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP referred
to in Clause 7.5(b) below is obtained, then each of Holdco and Warner Chilcott
will report the receipt of the Scheme Consideration in exchange for the Warner
Chilcott Shares pursuant to the Scheme as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for all Tax purposes except to the
extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code.

Warner Chilcott shall use reasonable endeavours to obtain a tax opinion of
Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, counsel to Warner Chilcott, dated the Effective
Date, and based on the facts, representations, assumptions and exclusions set
forth or described in such opinion, to the effect that the receipt of the
Scheme Consideration in exchange for the Warner Chilcott Shares pursuant to
the Scheme will qualify for United States federal income tax purposes as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Such
counsel shall be entitled to rely upon, and Warner Chilcott and Holdco shall
use reasonable endeavours to provide, customary representation letters from
each of Holdco and Warner Chilcott, in each case, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to such counsel and to Actavis, dated as of the
Effective Date.

Governance Committee of the Actavis Board pursuant to the director nomination
process set forth in Actavis's proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the

Actavis to Warner Chilcott, only four individuals who shall be members of the
Warner Chilcott Board as of the date of this Agreement shall be designated to
the Holdco Board, and the remaining position on the Holdco Board shall be
filled by a new independent director to be selected by the Governance
Committee of the Actavis Board. In the event that, prior to the Effective
Time, any designee of Warner Chilcott to the Holdco Board is unable to serve
on such board of directors, a replacement shall be similarly selected by the
Governance Committee of the Actavis Board from the existing members of the
Warner Chilcott Board as designated by Warner Chilcott.

shall be treated as having satisfied its obligation to deliver the Scheme
Consideration in full to such Person by delivering the Scheme Consideration
net of such withheld amounts and such Person shall not have any claim or
entitlement with respect to the Scheme Consideration attributable to such
withheld amounts.

consummation and implementation of the Scheme and the Acquisition. On
Completion, and in accordance with the NGCL, MergerSub shall be merged with
and into Actavis at the Merger Effective Time (as defined in Clause 8.2(b)).
Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of MergerSub shall
cease and Actavis shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation"). As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of the
Surviving Corporation shall be owned by U.S. Holdco and the Surviving
Corporation shall become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(b)

  |  

Merger Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a
certificate of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the NGCL shall
be duly executed by Actavis and MergerSub and as soon as practicable following
the Completion shall be filed on the Completion Date with the Secretary of
State of the State of Nevada (the "Certificate of Merger"). The Merger shall
become effective at the time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada or at such later time as may be
designated jointly by Actavis and Warner Chilcott and specified in such
Certificate of Merger; provided that the Merger shall become effective
substantially concurrently with the effectiveness of the Scheme, to the extent
possible (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "Merger Effective
Time").

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(c)

  |  

Effects of the Merger. At and after the Merger Effective Time, the Merger will
have the effects set forth in the Certificate of Merger and the NGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Merger
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of MergerSub shall cease and
all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Actavis and
MergerSub shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of Actavis and MergerSub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

Actavis's name.

     |  

(i)

  |  

Conversion of Actavis Common Stock. Each Actavis Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, and all rights in respect
thereof, shall be cancelled and automatically converted into and become the
right to receive one Holdco Share from U.S. Holdco and any cash in lieu of
Fractional Entitlements due to an Actavis Shareholder (the "Merger
Consideration"); provided, however, that no Fractional Entitlements shall be
due from U.S. Holdco to any Actavis Shareholders under this Clause 8.2(f)(i),
and all Fractional Entitlements that would otherwise have been due to any
Actavis Shareholders shall be aggregated and sold in the market by the
Exchange Agent

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

91  

  

 

 

 

  

  

with the net proceeds of any such sale distributed pro-rata to such Actavis
Shareholders in accordance with the Fractional Entitlements to which they
would otherwise have been entitled. As a result of the Merger, at the Merger
Effective Time, each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time represented outstanding Actavis
Shares (the "Actavis Certificates") and each holder of record of a non-
certificated outstanding Actavis Share represented by book entry ("Actavis
Book Entry Shares") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the consideration payable in respect of the
Actavis Shares represented by such Actavis Certificate or Actavis Book Entry
Share (as applicable) immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time to be
delivered in accordance with Clause 8.2(g).

  

  

     |  

(ii)

  |  

MergerSub Capital Stock. At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Parties or any of their respective
shareholders, each share of common stock of MergerSub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, and all rights in respect
thereof, shall forthwith be cancelled and cease to exist and be converted into
one hundred (100) fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation and all of which shall be held by
U.S. Holdco.

Actavis Book Entry Share, which at the Merger Effective Time were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Clause
8.2(f)(i), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title to the Actavis Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Actavis Certificates to the Exchange
Agent or, in the case of Actavis Book Entry Shares, upon adherence to the
procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal), and

92  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Actavis
Certificates and Actavis Book Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for

Certificates or Actavis Book Entry Shares (as applicable) for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the

applicable) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor: (a) that number
of Holdco Shares into which such holder's Actavis Shares represented by such
holder's properly surrendered Actavis Certificates or Actavis Book Entry
Shares (as applicable) were converted pursuant to Clause 8.2(f)(i), and the
Actavis Certificates or Actavis Book Entry Shares (as applicable) so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled, and (b) a check in an amount of U.S.
dollars (after giving effect to any required withholdings pursuant to Clause
8.2(g)(viii)) equal to any cash dividends or other distributions that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Clause 8.2(g)(iii) and the amount
of any cash payable in lieu of any Fractional Entitlements that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Clause 8.2(f)(i). No interest shall be

the Actavis Certificates or Actavis Book Entry Shares.

  

  

     |  

(iii)

  |  

Transferred Certificates; Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If payment
or issuance of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the surrendered Actavis Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition of payment or issuance that the Actavis Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the person requesting such payment or issuance shall
have paid to the Exchange Agent any transfer and other taxes required by
reason of the payment or issuance of the Merger Consideration to a person
other than the registered holder of the Actavis Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax
either has been paid or is not applicable. In the event that any Actavis
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holder's
compliance with the replacement requirements established by the Exchange
Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by the holder of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to the Actavis Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in
exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Actavis Certificate the applicable
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Actavis Shares represented by
the Actavis Certificate pursuant to this Clause 8.2.

   
---|---|---

Certificate or Actavis Book Entry Shares (as applicable) with respect to the
Actavis Shares represented thereby until such Actavis Certificate or Actavis
Book Entry Shares (as applicable) has been surrendered in accordance with this
Clause 8.2. Subject to applicable Law and the provisions of this Clause 8.2,
following surrender of any such Actavis Certificate or Actavis Book Entry
Shares (as applicable), there shall be paid to the record holder thereof by
the Exchange Agent, without interest promptly after such surrender, (a) the
number of Holdco

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

93  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Shares to which such record holder was entitled pursuant to this Clause 8.2
and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of any Fractional Entitlements that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Clause 8.2(f)(i), (b) at the
time of surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date on or after the date of the Merger Effective Time and a payment

     |  

(v)

  |  

No Further Ownership Rights in Actavis Shares. Until surrendered as
contemplated hereby, each Actavis Certificate or Actavis Book Entry Share
shall, after the Merger Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the
right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Clause 8.2, the issuance or payment of which shall be
deemed to be the satisfaction in full of all rights pertaining to Actavis
converted in the Merger. At the Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of Actavis shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Actavis Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time. If, after the Merger Effective Time, Actavis Certificates or
Actavis Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Clause 8.2.

Actavis Book Entry Shares (as applicable) as of the one-year anniversary of
the Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to Holdco or its designee, upon
demand, and the Holdco Shares included therein shall be sold at the best price
reasonably obtainable at that time. Any holder of Actavis Certificates or
Actavis Book Entry Shares (as applicable) who has not complied with this
Clause 8.2 prior to the one-year anniversary of the Merger Effective Time
shall thereafter look only to Holdco for payment of such holder's claim for
the Merger Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar applicable Laws).

who was a holder of Actavis Shares immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time such amounts as U.S. Holdco or the Exchange Agent may be required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any other provision of federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. To the

Each stock-based award, other than an Actavis Share Option or Restricted
Actavis Share ("Other Actavis Share-Based Awards"), granted under any Actavis
Share Plan and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as
of the Effective Time, cease to represent an award based on Actavis Shares and

the same terms and conditions (including the vesting terms) as were applicable

     |  

(c)

  |  

Upon:

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(i)

  |  

Actavis becoming entitled to an Actavis Reimbursement Payment, neither Warner
Chilcott nor any of its Representatives or shareholders shall have any further
liability in connection with the termination of this Agreement (for the
avoidance of doubt, other than the obligation to pay Actavis Reimbursement
Payments pursuant to the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement), whether under the
Expenses Reimbursement Agreement or this Agreement or otherwise, to Actavis,
its Representatives or its shareholders; or

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(ii)

  |  

Warner Chilcott becoming entitled to the Reverse Termination Payment, none of
the Actavis Parties nor any of their Representatives or shareholders shall
have any further liability in connection with the termination of this
Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, other than the obligation to pay the
Reverse Termination Payment), whether under the Expenses Reimbursement
Agreement or this Agreement or otherwise, to any of the Warner Chilcott
Parties or their Representatives or shareholders. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, none of the Warner Chilcott Parties or their
Representatives or shareholders (other than the Actavis Parties) shall have
any rights or claims against any Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Acquisition, the Financing or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, and no Financing Source shall have any rights or claims
against any of the Warner Chilcott Parties or their Representatives or
shareholders (other than the Actavis

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

97  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Parties) in connection with this Agreement, the Acquisition, the Financing or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise; provided that, following consummation of the
Acquisition, the foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties to the
Financing under any commitment letter related thereto. In addition, in no
event will any Financing Source be liable for consequential, special,
exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including any loss of profits,
business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortuous nature (it being
expressly agreed that the Financing Sources in their capacities as such shall
be third party beneficiaries of this Clause 9.1(c)(ii) and shall be entitled
to the protections of the provisions contained in this Clause 9.1(c)(ii) as if
they were a party to this Agreement);

  

  

provided, however, that nothing herein shall release any Party from liability
for intentional breach, for fraud or as provided for in the Confidentiality
Agreement.

  

  

     |  

(d)

  |  

For the avoidance of doubt, termination of this Agreement shall be without
prejudice to the provisions of the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement.

9.2

  |  

Certain Effects of Termination

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

In the event of a Specified Termination, then Actavis shall pay to Warner
Chilcott one hundred sixty million dollars ($160,000,000) (the "Reverse
Termination Payment") in cleared, immediately available funds as promptly as
possible (but in any event within three Business Days) thereafter; provided,
that in the event that an Actavis Change of Recommendation shall have occurred
and Warner Chilcott shall not have terminated this Agreement within five
Business Days thereafter in accordance with Clause 9.1(a)(viii), the amount of
the Reverse Termination Payment shall be reduced by the amount of the
documented, specific and quantifiable third party costs and expenses incurred
by Actavis, or on its behalf, for the purposes of, in preparation for, or in
connection with the Acquisition, including, but not limited to, arranging
financing, in each case solely to the extent incurred from and after the date
of the Actavis Change of Recommendation, up to a maximum reduction of the
Reverse Termination Payment of fifty-one million dollars ($51,000,000).

  

  

"Specified Termination" means:

  

  

     |  

(a)

  |  

this Agreement is terminated: by Warner Chilcott for the reason that the
Actavis Board or any committee thereof (A) withdraws (or modifies in any
manner adverse to Warner Chilcott), or proposes publicly to withdraw (or
modify in any manner adverse to Warner Chilcott), the Actavis Recommendation
or (B) approves, recommends or declares advisable, or proposes publicly to
approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Actavis Alternative Proposal (it
being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that the provision by Actavis to
Warner Chilcott of notice or information in connection with an Actavis
Alternative Proposal or Actavis Superior Proposal as required or expressly
permitted by the Transaction Agreement shall not, in and of itself, satisfy
this Clause 9.2(a)).

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(b)

  |  

all of the following occur:

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(i)

  |  

prior to the Actavis Shareholders Meeting, an Actavis Alternative Proposal is
publicly disclosed or any person shall have publicly announced an intention
(whether or not conditional) to make an Actavis Alternative Proposal and, in
each case, not publicly withdrawn at the time this Agreement is terminated
under the circumstances specified in Clause 9.2(b)(ii) (it being understood
that, for

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

98  

  

 

 

 

  

  

purposes of this Clause 9.2(b)(i) and Clause 9.2(b)(iii) below, references to
"25%" and "75%" in the definition of Actavis Alternative Proposal shall be
deemed to refer to "50%"); and

  

  

     |  

(ii)

  |  

this Agreement is terminated by either Warner Chilcott or Actavis for the
reason that the Actavis Shareholders Meeting shall have been completed and the
Actavis Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(iii)

  |  

a definitive agreement providing for an Actavis Alternative Proposal is
entered into within nine months after such termination (regardless of whether
such Actavis Alternative Proposal is the same Actavis Alternative Proposal
referred to in Clause 9.2(b)(i)) and such Actavis Alternative Proposal is
consummated; or

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(c)

  |  

all of the following occur:

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(i)

  |  

prior to the Actavis Shareholders Meeting, an Actavis Alternative Proposal is
publicly disclosed or any person shall have publicly announced an intention
(whether or not conditional) to make an Actavis Alternative Proposal and, in
each case, not publicly withdrawn at the time this Agreement is terminated
under the circumstances specified in Clause 9.2(c)(ii) (it being understood
that, for purposes of this Clause 9.2(c)(i) and Clause 9.2(c)(iii) below,
references to "25%" and "75%" in the definition of Actavis Alternative
Proposal shall be deemed to refer to "50%"); and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(ii)

  |  

this Agreement is terminated by Actavis for the reason that Warner Chilcott
shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or
failure to perform (A) would result in a failure of any of the conditions to
the Scheme or of the other conditions to Warner Chilcott's obligation to
effect the Acquisition and (B) is not reasonably capable of being cured by the
date that is one year after the date of this Agreement, provided that, Warner
Chilcott shall have given Actavis written notice, delivered at least 30 days
prior to such termination, stating Warner Chilcott's intention to terminate
this Agreement for such reason and the basis for such termination (provided
that this Clause 9.2(c)(ii) shall not be deemed satisfied unless such breach
or failure to perform was intentional); and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

(iii)

  |  

an Actavis Alternative Proposal is consummated, or a definitive agreement
providing for an Actavis Alternative Proposal is entered into, within nine
months after such termination (regardless of whether such Actavis Alternative
Proposal is the same Actavis Alternative Proposal referred to in Clause
9.2(c)(i)).

Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, the Takeover Rules, a court

(including, without limitation, the Panel), the Parties shall consult together
as to the terms of, the timing of and the manner of publication of any formal
public announcement which either Party may make primarily regarding the
Acquisition, the Scheme, the Merger or this Agreement. Actavis and Warner
Chilcott shall give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon any such public announcement and shall not issue any such public
announcement prior to such consultation,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

99  

  

 

 

 

  

  

except as may be required by applicable Law, the Takeover Rules, a court
order, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the SEC or any Relevant Authority
(including, without limitation, the Panel). The Parties agree that the initial
press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be in the form of the Rule 2.5 Announcement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Clause 10.1 do not apply to any
announcement, document or publication in connection with a Warner Chilcott
Alternative Proposal or Warner Chilcott Superior Proposal or a change in the
Scheme Recommendation or any amendment to the terms of the Scheme proposed by
Actavis that would effect an increase in the Scheme Consideration whether
before or after a withdrawal or adverse modification of the Scheme
Recommendation.

Amendment

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

No amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless the same shall be
evidenced in writing duly executed by each of the Parties, except that
following approval by the Warner Chilcott Shareholders or the Actavis
Shareholders there shall be no amendment to the provisions hereof which by Law
requires further approval by the Warner Chilcott Shareholders or the Actavis
Shareholders without such further approval nor shall there be any amendment or
change not permitted under applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, this Clause 10.5 and Clauses 9.1(c)(ii), 10.13(c) and
10.13(d) (and any other provision of this Agreement to the extent an
amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification of such provision would

Material Adverse Effect" may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise
modified without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources (it being

Chilcott in connection herewith, constitutes the entire agreement and

10.7

  |  

Inadequacy of Damages

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Each Party agrees that damages would not be an adequate remedy for any breach

proof of special damages, to the remedies of injunction, specific performance
or other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of this
Agreement.

(b)

  |

or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

Acquisition (including any such term, provision, covenant or condition that is
expressly subject to the consent of a Relevant Authority) is held by a court

Agreement or, as appropriate, the terms and conditions of the Acquisition, so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
equitable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible in
accordance with applicable law.

     |

to this Agreement.
