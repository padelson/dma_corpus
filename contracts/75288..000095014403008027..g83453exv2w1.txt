described in Section 3.1 and any resulting Tax Benefits. As used herein, the

"Current Liabilities" means those liabilities of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries of the type listed on Part II of Exhibit 3.6. The Current Assets

the Buyer, at the sole expense of the Company, an estimated closing statement

3.6.2.2 The Estimated Closing Statement and the estimated Net Working Capital

Estimated Closing Statement shall be subject to the approval of the Buyer,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.   3.6.2.3 The parties

Section 3.1 is based on the assumption that the Net Working Capital of the
Company shall be equal to Forty One Million Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars
($41,900,000) (the "Assumed Net Working Capital"). Accordingly, the parties
hereto agree that if the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than the
Assumed Net Working Capital (the amount of such shortfall, if any, is
hereinafter referred to as the "Estimated Working Capital Deficit"), the
Buyer shall deduct from the Cash Equity Amount, on a dollar for dollar basis,
the Estimated Working Capital Deficit. If the Estimated Net Working Capital
is greater than the Assumed Net Working Capital (the amount of such excess is
hereinafter referred to as the "Estimated Working Capital Surplus"), the
Buyer shall add to the Cash Equity Amount, on a dollar for dollar basis, the
Estimated Working Capital Surplus.   3.6.3. Preparation of Proposed Closing
Statement. Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers\' Representatives a closing
statement of the Company as of Closing Date (the "Proposed Closing
Statement"), which Proposed Closing Statement shall set forth the proposed
calculation of the Current Assets, the Current Liabilities, and the Net
Working Capital.   3.6.4. Examination of Proposed Closing Statement.
The Sellers\' Representatives shall review the Proposed Closing Statement to
confirm the accuracy of the Proposed Closing Statement and of the Buyer\'s
calculation of the Net Working Capital. In connection with such  
-13-    review, the Buyer will provide the Sellers\' Representatives and
their representatives with reasonable access to appropriate personnel, books,
records, documents and other information of the Company. If the Sellers\'
Representatives fail to give the Buyer written notice of any disputed amounts
within fifteen (15) days after the Sellers\' Representatives receive the
Proposed Closing Statement (the "Review Period"), then the Proposed Closing
Statement shall become the "Final Closing Statement" (as defined below) for
purposes hereof. If the Sellers\' Representatives give the Buyer written
notice of any disputed items within the Review Period, the Sellers\'
Representatives and the Buyer shall attempt in good faith to agree on any
adjustments that should be made to the Proposed Closing Statement in order to
reflect the Net Working Capital. If the Sellers\' Representatives and the
Buyer are unable to resolve any disputed amounts within forty-five (45) days
after the Sellers\' Representatives receive the Proposed Closing Statement,
the Buyer and the Sellers\' Representatives shall submit their final
calculations of the items in dispute to an arbitrator (the "Arbitrator") who
shall be, or shall have previously been, an audit partner in a nationally
recognized independent accounting firm and who shall be appointed
by agreement of the Buyer and the Sellers\' Representatives or, failing
such agreement, by the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "Arbitration Rules") of
the AAA. The Arbitrator shall review such final calculations and make a
selection as to which of the final calculations presented to it is, in the
aggregate, more accurate. The decision of the Arbitrator shall be made in
accordance with the Arbitration Rules and in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, including the procedures set forth on Exhibit 3.6. The
decision of the Arbitrator shall be made within thirty (30) days after being
engaged, or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable, and shall be final
and binding on the parties. The costs and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be
paid by the party whose proposed calculation is not selected by the
Arbitrator. The Buyer and the Sellers\' Representatives shall make available
to the Arbitrator all relevant books and records relating to the calculations
submitted and all other information reasonably requested by the Arbitrator.
The Proposed Closing Statement shall be revised, if necessary, to reflect the
final determination of the Net Working Capital (the final form of the
Proposed Closing Statement, including any revisions which are made thereto
pursuant to this Section 3.6.4, is referred to herein as the "Final Closing
Statement").   3.6.5. Adjustments.   3.6.5.1 If the Net Working Capital as
reflected on the Final Closing Statement is less than the Estimated Net
Working Capital (the amount of such shortfall, if any, is hereinafter
referred to as the "Working Capital Deficit"), the Sellers shall be obligated
on a joint and several basis to pay to the Buyer, on a dollar for dollar
basis, an amount equal to the Working Capital Deficit (such payment shall be
hereinafter referred to as a "Working Capital Payment"). The Working Capital
Payment, if any, shall be paid in cash by the Sellers to the Buyer within ten
(10) days of the final determination of the Final Closing Statement;
provided, however, that if any Working Capital Payment is due to the Buyer
pursuant to this Section 3.6.5.1, the Buyer shall first seek to recover up to
$2,500,000 of such payment from the Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the Buyer may, at its sole
discretion, claim all or any part of any Working Capital Payment due to it
from any Seller pursuant to this Section 3.6.5.1 either directly from such
Seller or from the Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement or may set off such amount from any Earnout Amount pursuant to the
terms of the Earnout Agreement.   -14-     3.6.5.2 If the Net Working
Capital as reflected on the Final Closing Statement is greater than the
Estimated Net Working Capital (the amount of such excess is hereinafter
referred to as the "Working Capital Surplus"), the Buyer shall pay the
Sellers, on a dollar for dollar basis, pro rata according to each Seller\'s
Seller\'s Percentage, an amount equal to the Working Capital Surplus (such
payment shall be hereinafter referred to as a "Surplus Payment"). The Surplus
Payment, if any, shall be paid in cash by the Buyer to the Sellers within ten
(10) days of the final determination of the Final Closing Statement.  
3.6.5.3 The determination of the Working Capital Payment or the Surplus
Payment, as the case may be, shall be made by the Buyer and the Sellers\'
Representatives immediately following the final determination of the Final
Closing Statement. Any amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 3.6.5
shall accrue simple interest thereon at a rate of 5% per annum commencing on
the Closing Date and continuing to and including the date of payment, and
such interest shall be paid together with the adjustment amount being
paid.  4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS. Each of the

therein, and subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial
statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments. All of such SEC
Reports, as of their   -36-    respective dates (and as of the date of
any amendment to the respective SEC Report), complied as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.   6.9. Other Information. The
Buyer has heretofore delivered to the Sellers true and complete copies of

2003 (the "Unaudited Buyer Financial Information"). The Unaudited Buyer
Financial Information has been prepared from, and is in accordance with, the
books and records of the Buyer, was prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied throughout the periods specified therein, and is correct
and complete and presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position and results of operations of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries for the
periods specified therein, subject to the absence of notes and normal year
end adjustments. The Buyer makes no representation or warranty with respect
to any financial projection or other forward looking statement contained in
any information provided or disclosed to the Sellers.   6.10. Final Closing

appropriate Governmental Authorities, a notification with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the HSR Act, supply

comply as promptly as practicable with all governmental requirements
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to obtain

Date, upon the Buyer\'s written request and at the Company\'s expense, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (but the Sellers shall

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
written consents or waivers under or with respect to the Contracts set forth
on Schedule 7.3.2.   7.4. Further Assurances. Each party, upon the request

properties, business and operating and financial conditions; provided,
however, that the Buyer and its representatives shall not unreasonably
disrupt the personnel and operations of the Company.   7.6. Stockholders
Agreement. The Company and each of the Sellers hereby agree to take all
actions necessary to cause the Stockholders Agreement to terminate as of the
Closing Date (except for the indemnification provisions set forth therein,
which shall continue in full force and effect after the Closing) and to
thereafter be of no further force and effect. The Sellers shall deliver
written evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer of such termination.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement or the
Stockholders Agreement, no provision in the Stockholders Agreement shall
limit in any way the rights of any Buyer Indemnitee or the obligation of any
Seller pursuant to Article 10 of this Agreement.   7.7. Sellers\'
Representatives. Without any further act of the Sellers and unless otherwise
specified herein, David J. Oddi and S. Anthony Margolis (acting jointly and
not separately) are hereby constituted and appointed by the Sellers as the
representatives of the Sellers (the "Sellers\' Representatives") to act as
agents for and on behalf of the Sellers, to give and receive notices and
communications, to agree to, negotiate or enter into any settlement,
compromise or submission to arbitration of any claim hereunder, or the
determination of any other matter requiring consent or approval of
the Sellers or their assigns pursuant to this Agreement, the Earnout
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement or any
other agreement entered into in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified herein, the Buyer and the
Company shall be fully   -40-    authorized to act on the joint written
consent or approval of the Sellers\' Representatives. The identity of the
Sellers\' Representatives may be changed by the Required Sellers from time to
time.   7.8. Real Property Holding Corporation Certificate. The
Company shall provide the Sellers with a certificate pursuant to Treas. Reg.
Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3) (in a form reasonably satisfactory to
the Sellers) to the effect that the Company is not, and has not been at any
time during the previous five years, a United States real property holding
corporation within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code. The certificate
shall be signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company under penalties
of perjury and dated as of the Closing Date. In connection with such
certification, the Company shall comply with the notification requirements of
Treas. Reg. Section 1.897-2(h)(2). The Sellers shall provide such certificate
to the Buyer in order for the Buyer not to withhold tax from the sales
proceeds under Section 897 and Section 1445 of the Code.   7.9.
Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees. The parties agree that
(a) at the Closing, the Buyer shall pay to the Company (or to a third party
at the direction of the Company) pursuant to Section 3.1(iii) an amount
sufficient to enable the Company to purchase "tail" coverage for a period of
six years under the directors and officers liability insurance policy of
the Company, as in effect on the Closing Date, and (b) following the Closing,
the Company shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Company to, ensure that no
change will be made to the Company\'s Charter or By-laws that would adversely
affect any director\'s or officer\'s right to indemnification under the
Delaware General Corporation Law or otherwise with respect to any periods
prior to the Closing. This Section 7.9 shall be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, the individuals who were directors, officers and employees
of the Company prior to the Closing Date, and their respective heirs and
estates. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement or the insurance
policies contemplated by this Section 7.9, no provision or indemnification
right in such insurance policies shall limit in any way the right of any
Buyer Indemnitee or the obligation of any Seller pursuant to Article 10 of
this Agreement.   7.10. Tax Matters.   7.10.1. Tax Periods Ending on or
Before the Closing Date. Subject to Section 7.10.3, the Buyer shall prepare
or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns of the
Company and the Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date which are due to be filed after the Closing Date. The Sellers
shall reimburse the Buyer, on a pro rata basis according to each Seller\'s
Seller\'s Percentage, for Taxes of the Company and the Subsidiaries with
respect to such periods reflected on a Final Tax Return (as defined below) to
the extent such Taxes are not reflected in the reserve for Tax liability
(excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) shown on the face of the Final
Closing Statement. The Sellers shall make such reimbursement within fifteen
(15) days after the later to occur of (a) the date an applicable Final Tax
Return becomes final pursuant to Section 7.10.3 hereof, or (b) the date
the Final Closing Statement becomes final pursuant to Section 3.6.4 hereof.
All Tax Returns will be prepared in a manner reasonably consistent with prior
practice of the Company and the Subsidiaries, to the extent such prior
practices are in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements.  
-41-     7.10.2. Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After
the Closing Date. Subject to Section 7.10.3, the Buyer shall prepare or cause
to be prepared and file or cause to be filed any Tax Returns of the Company
and the Subsidiaries for Tax periods which begin before the Closing Date and
end after the Closing Date. The Sellers shall pay to the Buyer, on a pro rata
basis according to each Seller\'s Seller\'s Percentage, an amount equal to
the portion of such Taxes which relates to the portion of such Taxable period
ending on the Closing Date reflected on a Final Tax Return to the extent such
Taxes are not reflected in the reserve for Tax liability (excluding any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) shown on the face of the Final Closing Statement. The
Sellers shall make such reimbursement within fifteen (15) days after the
later to occur of (a) the date an applicable Final Tax Return becomes final
pursuant to Section 7.10.3 hereof, or (b) the date the Final Closing
Statement becomes final pursuant to Section 3.6.4 hereof. For purposes of
this Section 7.10.2, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic
basis and are payable for a Taxable period that includes (but does not end
on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of
such Taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any
Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed
to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Taxable period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Taxable period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Taxable period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or
related to income or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which would be
payable if the relevant Taxable period ended on the Closing Date. Any credits
relating to a Taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing
Date shall be taken into account as though the relevant Taxable period ended
on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to
the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practice of the Company and the Subsidiaries.   7.10.3. Tax Returns. Not
less than sixty (60) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of any
Tax Return to be filed by the Buyer pursuant to Section 7.10.1 or 7.10.2, the
Buyer shall deliver to the Sellers\' Representatives a copy of such Tax
Return (a "Proposed Tax Return") for their review and comment. The Sellers\'
Representatives shall have fifteen (15) days after the date of receipt of the
Proposed Tax Return (the "Tax Review Period") to give the Buyer written
notice of any disputed amounts or positions (each a "Tax Item") with respect
to such return. If the Sellers\' Representatives fail to give written notice
of any disputed Tax Item with respect to a Proposed Tax Return during the Tax
Review Period, then the Proposed Tax Return shall become a Final Tax Return
(as defined below) for purposes hereof. If the Sellers\' Representatives give
the Buyer written notice of any disputed Tax Item within the Review Period,
the Sellers\' Representatives and the Buyer shall attempt in good faith to
agree on any adjustments that should be made to the Proposed Tax Return. If
the Sellers\' Representatives and the Buyer are unable to resolve
any disputed Tax Item within twenty (20) days after the Sellers\'
Representatives receive the Proposed Tax Return, the Buyer and the Sellers\'
Representatives shall submit (as soon as practicable, but in any event,
within two (2) days of the end of such 20 day period) their final
calculations of the Tax Item in dispute to an arbitrator (the "Tax
Arbitrator") who shall be, or shall have previously been, a tax partner in a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm and who shall be appointed
by agreement of the Buyer and the Sellers\' Representatives or, failing such
agreement, by the AAA in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the AAA.
The Arbitrator shall review the calculations of the Buyer and the Sellers\'
Representatives with respect to the disputed Proposed Tax Return  
-42-    and make a selection for each disputed Tax Item as to which of the
final calculations presented to it is, in the aggregate, more accurate. The
decision of the Arbitrator shall be made in accordance with the Arbitration
Rules and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The decision of the
Arbitrator shall be made within twenty (20) days after being engaged, or as
soon thereafter as reasonably practicable, and shall be final and binding on
the parties. The costs and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be paid by the
party whose proposed calculations are, in the aggregate, more accurate, or,
if it is not clear which party\'s calculations are, in the aggregate, more
accurate (as determined by the Arbitrator), the costs and expenses shall be
shared equally by the Buyer on the one hand and the Sellers, on a pro rata
basis based on each Seller\'s Seller\'s Percentage, on the other hand. The
Buyer and the Sellers\' Representatives shall make available to the
Arbitrator all relevant books and records relating to the calculations
submitted and all other information reasonably requested by the Arbitrator. A
Proposed Tax Return shall be revised, if necessary, to reflect the final
determination of the Tax Items with respect to such return (the final form of
the Proposed Tax Return, including any revisions which are made
thereto pursuant to this Section 7.10.3, is referred to herein as a "Final
Tax Return").   7.10.4. Tax Reimbursements by Buyer. The Buyer
shall reimburse the Sellers, on a pro rata basis according to each Seller\'s
Seller\'s Percentage, the amount, if any, by which the reserves shown on the
face of the Final Closing Statement with respect to Taxes exceed the
aggregate amount actually paid by or on behalf of the Company and/or the
Subsidiaries for Taxes that are reflected on a Final Tax Return for all Tax
periods contemplated by Section 7.10.1 and for the portion of such Tax
periods contemplated by Section 7.10.2 ending on the Closing Date. The Buyer
shall make such reimbursement within fifteen (15) days after the later to
occur of (a) the date an applicable Final Tax Return becomes final pursuant
to Section 7.10.3 hereof, or (b) the date the Final Closing Statement becomes
final pursuant to Section 3.6.4 hereof.   7.10.5. Tax Refunds. The Sellers
shall be entitled to all refunds of Taxes of the Company, and any amounts
credited against Taxes to which the Company becomes entitled, to the extent
such refunds or credits relate to Tax periods or portions thereof that end on
or before the Closing Date. The Sellers shall not be entitled to any refunds
or credits attributable to carrybacks from Tax periods or portions thereof
that began after the Closing Date. If the Buyer or the Company receives any
refund or credit to which the Sellers are entitled under this Section 7.10.5,
the Buyer shall within fifteen (15) days of receipt pay in cash (or cause the
Company to pay) the amount of such refund or credit to the Sellers in
accordance with each Seller\'s respective Seller\'s Percentage.   7.10.6.
Cooperation. The Sellers and the Buyer shall cooperate fully with each other
and make available to each other in a timely fashion such Tax data and other
information as may be reasonably required by the Sellers or the Buyer for the
preparation of any Tax Returns required to be prepared and filed by the
Required Sellers or the Buyer hereunder, or in connection with the
preparation or filing of any election, consent, certification, information
statement or similar document or in preparing for any audits or disputes with
any taxing authorities after the Closing Date. The Buyer will cause the
Company to provide to the Sellers full access, at any reasonable time and
from time to time, at the business location at which the books and records
are maintained, to such Tax data of the Company as the Sellers may from time
to time reasonably request. The Buyer agrees to retain all books and records
provided to it with respect to Tax matters pertinent to Company or
the Sellers relating to any taxable period   -43-    beginning before
the Balance Sheet Date until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by a Seller, any extensions thereof)
of the respective taxable periods. The Buyer and each Seller further agrees,
upon request, to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any
other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).   7.11. Employee Benefits.   (a) The
Buyer agrees that for purposes of participation, vesting and accrual of
vacation time and other benefits, as applicable (i) service under any
qualified defined contribution plans of the Company shall be treated as
service under the Buyer\'s qualified defined contribution plans, and (ii)
service under any other employee benefit plans of the Company shall
be treated as service under any corresponding employee benefit plans
maintained by the Buyer. The Buyer shall cause the Buyer\'s welfare benefit
plans that cover the Company\'s employees after the Closing to (i) waive any
waiting period and restrictions and limitations for pre-existing conditions
or insurability (except for pre-existing conditions that were excluded under
the Company\'s welfare benefit plans), and (ii) cause any deductible, co-
insurance or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by the Company\'s employees
under the Company\'s welfare benefit plans to be credited to such employees
under the Buyer\'s welfare benefit plans, so as to reduce the amount of any
deductible, co-insurance or maximum out-of-pocket payments payable by the
Company\'s employees under the Buyer\'s welfare benefit plans.   (b)
Following the Closing, the Buyer shall cause the Company to continue the
employment of those individuals listed on Schedule 7.11(b) hereto until at
least the first anniversary of the Closing Date on terms at least as
favorable as the terms of employment for such individuals as of the date
hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall retain the right to
terminate the employment of any such individual for appropriate cause.  
7.12. No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals. The Company and the Sellers
agree that from the date hereof through the Closing Date or the date
of termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 12.1, as the case
may be, neither the Company nor any Seller will, directly or indirectly,
through any officer, director, employee, leased employee, partner,
stockholder, agent, or Affiliate or otherwise, except in furtherance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a) solicit, initiate, or
encourage submission of proposals or offers from any Person relating to any
transactions contemplated herein or to the direct or indirect purchase of a
material amount of the assets of, or any equity interest in, or any merger,
consolidation, or business combination with, the Company (collectively, an
"Acquisition Proposal"), (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any other Person any information with respect to, or
otherwise cooperate in any way with or assist, facilitate, or encourage, any
Acquisition Proposal by any Person, (c) enter into any agreement,
arrangement, or understanding with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or (d)
sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any agreement,
arrangement, or understanding with respect to, any interest in the assets,
capital stock or other equity interests of the Company.   -44-     7.13.
Audit of Year-End Financial Statements. If requested by the Buyer, the
Company and the Sellers shall (a) use their commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Company\'s independent auditors (the "Company Auditors")
to deliver such representations, reports, and consents as are requested by
the Buyer in order to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC and
other Legal Requirements applicable to the Buyer and (b) if any pro forma
financial statements are required by such SEC rules and regulations or other
Legal Requirements (the "Required Pro Forma Financials"), use their
commercially reasonable efforts to, and use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Company Auditors to, assist with and facilitate the
completion and audit of such Required Pro Forma Financials prior to the
sixtieth (60th day) following the Closing Date.   7.14. Interim Financials;
Cooperation with Financing. During the period prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide to the Buyer consolidated monthly balance sheets,
statements of operations, stockholders\' equity (deficiency), and cash flow
within 10 Business Days after the end of each month. Further, the Company
shall provide, and shall cause the Subsidiaries to provide, all reasonable
cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Buyer\'s financing
including (a) promptly providing to the Buyer\'s financing sources all
material financial information in their possession with respect to the
Company and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
reasonably requested by the Buyer, including information and projections
prepared by the Company relating to the Company and the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, (b) causing the Company\'s senior officers

then known) the amount and basis of such claim, is delivered to the relevant
indemnifying parties on or prior to the close of business on the
second anniversary of the Closing Date.   10.5. Limitation on Remedies.
From and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of each Seller
Indemnitee and Buyer Indemnitee as against any Person, with respect to all
claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, shall be pursuant to
the indemnification provisions set forth in this Section 10, other than with
respect to such Person\'s fraud or criminal activity.   10.6. Third Party
Claims. Promptly after the receipt by any Person entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Section 10 (the "Indemnified Party") of notice of the
commencement of any action, including the commencement of any audit or other
proceedings conducted by Tax authorities, against such Indemnified Party by a
third party (such action, a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party
shall, if a claim with respect thereto is to be made against any party
obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to this Section 10
(the "Indemnifying Party"), give such Indemnifying Party written notice of
such Third Party Claim in reasonable detail in light of the circumstances
then known to such Indemnified Party. The failure to give such notice shall
not relieve any Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder except to
the extent that such failure prejudices such Indemnifying Party. Such
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third Party Claim, at
such Indemnifying Party\'s expense and with counsel of its choice reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, provided that the Indemnifying Party
conducts the defense of such Third Party Claim actively and diligently. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party agrees to reasonably cooperate in such defense at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party. So long as the Indemnifying Party is
conducting the defense of such claim actively and diligently, the Indemnified
Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and may
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim, and neither any  
-52-    Indemnifying Party nor any Indemnified Party will consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the other, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, unless (i) the proposed settlement imposes
only monetary payment obligations less than the indemnification obligations
of the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 10,
and (ii) such settlement includes a full release of the Indemnified Party in
respect of all indemnifiable Losses resulting therefrom, related thereto or
arising therefrom. In the event the Indemnifying Party does not or ceases to
conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim actively and diligently, (x)
the Indemnified Party may defend against, and, with the prior written consent
of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to, such Third Party Claim (provided that the Indemnifying Party may
retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and may participate
in the defense of such Third Party Claim), (y) the Indemnifying Party will
reimburse the Indemnified Party for the costs of defending against such Third
Party Claim to the extent provided in this Section 10 and (z) the
Indemnifying Party will remain responsible for any Losses the Indemnified
Party may suffer as a result of such Third Party Claim to the extent provided
in this Section 10.   10.7. Tax Benefits. At such time, if ever, as the
Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including, for all periods after the Closing Date,
the Company) realizes a Tax Benefit as a result of a Loss for which the Buyer
has been indemnified by the Sellers hereunder (any such Tax Benefit to be
determined after taking into consideration any Tax effect of the
indemnification payment made to Buyer with respect to such Loss), the Buyer
shall pay an amount equal to such Tax Benefit to the Sellers (on a pro rata
basis based on their respective Seller\'s Percentage) who indemnified the
Buyer with respect to such Loss.   10.8. Cash Purchase Price Adjustment. Any
indemnification payment made by the Company, the Buyer or the Sellers
pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated by the Buyer and the Sellers as
an adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price for Tax purposes.  11. CONSENT TO
JURISDICTION; JURY TRIAL WAIVER.   11.1. Consent to Jurisdiction. Each party
to this Agreement, by its execution hereof, (a) hereby irrevocably submits,
and agrees to cause each of its Subsidiaries to submit, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the state courts of the State of New York located in New York
County or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York for the purpose of any action, claim, cause of action or suit (in
contract, tort or otherwise), inquiry proceeding or investigation arising out
of or based upon this Agreement or relating to the subject matter hereof, (b)
hereby waives, and agrees to cause each of its Subsidiaries to waive, to the
extent not prohibited by applicable law, and agrees not to assert, and agrees
not to allow any of its Subsidiaries to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense or otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property
is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that any such proceeding
brought in one of the above-named courts is improper, or that this Agreement
or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such court and (c)
hereby agrees not to commence or to permit any of its Subsidiaries to
commence any action, claim, cause of action or suit (in contract, tort or
otherwise), inquiry, proceeding or investigation arising out of or based upon
this Agreement or   -53-    relating to the subject matter hereof other
than before one of the above-named courts nor to make any motion or take any
other action seeking or intending to cause the transfer or removal of any
such action, claim, cause of action or suit (in contract, tort or otherwise),
inquiry, proceeding or investigation to any court other than one of the
above-named court whether on the grounds of inconvenient forum or otherwise.
Each party hereby consents to service of process in any such proceeding in
any manner permitted by New York law, and agrees that service of process by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address
specified pursuant to Section 13.6 is reasonably calculated to give actual
notice.   11.2. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED
BY APPLICABLE LAW WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, AND AGREES TO CAUSE EACH OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO WAIVE, AND COVENANTS
THAT NEITHER IT NOR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES WILL ASSERT (WHETHER AS
PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN
RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, ACTION, CLAIM, CAUSE OF ACTION, SUIT (IN CONTRACT, TORT
OR OTHERWISE), INQUIRY, PROCEEDING OR INVESTIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR BASED
UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH
OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, IN EACH
CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING. THE BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
IT HAS BEEN INFORMED BY THE SELLERS THAT THIS SECTION 11.2 CONSTITUTES A
MATERIAL INDUCEMENT UPON WHICH THE SELLERS ARE RELYING AND WILL RELY IN
ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS RELATING HERETO OR
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A
COPY OF THIS SECTION 11.2 WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT
OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.  12.

and such breach, if curable, has continued without cure for a period of 30
days after delivery of such notice of breach.   12.1.4. The Buyer or the
Required Sellers may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to
the other at any time on or after June 30, 2003, if the Closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not have occurred by reason
of the failure of any condition set forth in Section 8, in the case of the
Buyer, or Section 9, in the case of the Required Sellers, to be satisfied
(other than through the failure of any party seeking to terminate this
Agreement to comply fully with its obligations under
this Agreement).  Further, notwithstanding anything else contained in this
Agreement, the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 12.1
shall not be available to any party (a) that is in material breach of its
obligations hereunder or (b) whose failure to fulfill its obligations or to
comply with its covenants under this Agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure to satisfy any condition to the obligations of
either party hereunder.   12.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1, all obligations of
the parties hereunder (other than obligations under Sections 11 and 12, which
shall survive termination) shall terminate without any liability of any party
to any other party, except for liabilities with respect to breaches by any
party on or prior to the date of termination of any covenants or agreements
contained herein.  13. MISCELLANEOUS.   13.1. Entire Agreement; Waivers.

extent compatible with, and possible under, applicable law. The provisions
hereof are severable, and in the event any provision hereof should be held
invalid or unenforceable in any   -55-    respect, it shall not
invalidate, render unenforceable or otherwise affect any other provision
hereof.   13.4. Successors and Assigns. All of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of

assignment by any party hereto shall be permitted without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto and any such attempted transfer or
assignment without consent shall be null and void and (b) no transfer or

or any of their representatives or  advisors to undertake any actions
required to be taken by them  thereunder (or the taking of any actions not
permitted to be taken by  them thereunder), (iii) paragraph (b) of Exhibit C

undertake  any actions required to be taken by them thereunder (or the taking
of  any actions not permitted to be taken by them thereunder), or (vi) 
Section 3(iii) thereof to the extent such failure results from the  failure

thereof is an event or condition referred to in  Section D(ii)(b) thereof),
or (iii) Section D(iii) thereof to the  extent such termination relates to
information provided in writing to  the Buyer by the Company or any of the
Sellers).   then the Buyer shall, within five (5) days of such
termination,  reimburse the Company and the Sellers for all fees and
expenses  incurred by the Company and the Sellers (up to a maximum of
