(a) The Company Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DRULPA and
the MGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Company Merger Effective Time, all the properties, rights,

assets to Merger Sub I in exchange for the Company Share Merger Consideration
to be provided to the stockholders of the Company and the assumption of all of
the Companys liabilities, followed by a distribution of the Company Share
Merger Consideration to the stockholders of the Company in
liquidation pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code, and that
this Agreement be, and is hereby adopted as, a "plan of liquidation" of the
Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (b) the Partnership Merger
shall be treated as (i) a taxable sale of the Partnership Units by the Cash-
Out Limited Partners in exchange for the cash portion of the Partnership Unit
Merger Consideration and (ii) a contribution of Partnership Units to the
Surviving Partnership by the Roll-Over Limited Partners in exchange for New
Partnership Preferred Units in a tax deferred transaction under Section 721

 



5  of the Code to the extent applicable to the exchange by each Roll-Over
Limited Partner. The parties hereto agree not to take any position on any Tax
Return that is inconsistent with the foregoing for all U.S. federal, and, if
applicable, state and local tax purposes.

ARTICLE II.

 

MERGER CONSIDERATION; COMPANY SHARES; PARTNERSHIP UNITS

 

Section 2.1 _Company Share Merger Consideration; Effect on Company
Shares_.

 

(a) _Partnership Interest of Merger Sub I_. At the Company Merger
Effective Time, by virtue of the Company Merger and without any action on the
part of any holder thereof, each unit of partnership interest of Merger Sub I
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time
shall remain as one issued and outstanding unit of partnership interest of
the Surviving Company.

 

(b) _Company Share Merger Consideration; Conversion of Company Shares_.
At the Company Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Company Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder thereof, each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (each, a " _Company Share_ ")
(other than any Company Subsidiary Shares or Excluded Shares, if any) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, shall automatically be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the sum of (i)
Twenty-Three Dollars and Seventy-Five Cents ($23.75) plus (ii) the Additional
Consideration, without interest (such sum, the " _Per Company Share Merger
Consideration_ "). The aggregate amount of cash payable to holders of Company
Shares as the Per Company Share Merger Consideration is hereinafter referred
to as the " _Company Share Merger Consideration_." The Per Company Share
Merger Consideration shall be subject to adjustments as contemplated by
_Section 5.12_.

(c) _Company Shares Owned by the Company Subsidiaries_. At the
Company Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Company Merger and without any
action on the part of any holder thereof, each issued and outstanding Company
Share that is owned by any direct or indirect Company Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (each, a " _Company Subsidiary
Share_ ") shall be automatically converted into and become one validly issued
and fully paid unit of limited partnership interest (each, a " _Surviving
Company Partnership Interest_ ") of the Surviving Company. From and after the
Company Merger Effective Time, all certificates representing Company Shares
owned by any direct or indirect Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time shall be deemed for all purposes to represent
the number of Surviving Company Partnership Interests into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(d) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned and Merger Sub I-Owned
Company Shares_. Each issued and outstanding Company Share that is owned by
Parent, Merger Sub I or any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub I immediately
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (collectively, the " _Excluded
Shares_ "), if any, shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no cash, Per Company Share Merger Consideration or other
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

 



6 (e) _Cancellation of Company Shares_. As of the Company Merger
Effective Time, all Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Company Merger Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a Company Share (other than Excluded Shares and any Company

Section 2.2 _Partnership Unit Merger Consideration; Effect on
Partnership Units_.

(a) _Partnership Unit Merger Consideration; Conversion of Partnership
Units_. At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the
Partnership Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof,
each Partnership Unit held by a Minority Limited Partner issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, shall be converted into,
and shall be canceled in exchange for, the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the Per Company Share Merger Consideration, without interest (the "
_Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration_ "); _provided_ , that in lieu of
receiving the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration with respect to
Partnership Units subject to a Unit Election, if but only if (x) the holder of
such Partnership Unit has effectively made and not revoked a valid election
pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ to receive New Partnership Preferred Units in
respect thereof and (y) the issuance of such New Partnership Preferred Units
would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act and applicable
state and foreign securities laws, then each of such holders Partnership
Units subject to a Unit Election shall be converted into one fully paid New
Partnership Preferred Unit, without interest. The aggregate amount of cash
payable as the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration together with the New
Partnership Preferred Units are hereinafter referred to as the " _Partnership
Unit Merger Consideration_ " and, together with the Company Share Merger
Consideration and the aggregate Per Company Share Merger Consideration payable
in respect of Earned Units pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_, the " _Merger
Consideration_."

 

(b) _Election of New Partnership Preferred Units_. Subject to 
_Section 2.2(b)(iv)_ and in accordance with _Section 2.2(a)_, each eligible
holder of Partnership Units shall be entitled, with respect to all or a
portion of such holders Partnership Units as specified by such holder in the
holders Form of Election, to make an unconditional election, on or prior to
the Election Date, to receive in the Partnership Merger in lieu of the Per
Partnership Unit Merger Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled, New Partnership Preferred Units (a " _Unit Election_ ") as follows:

 

(i) Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Partnership, as promptly
as practicable following the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the
stockholders of the Company and, in any event, not later than five (5)
Business Days after the date on which the Proxy Statement is first mailed to
the stockholders of the Company, and the Partnership shall mail to the
holders of Partnership Units, a form of election, which form shall be subject
to the reasonable approval of the Company (the " _Form of Election_ "). The
Form of Election may be used by each eligible holder of

 



7  Partnership Units to designate such holders election to convert any
Partnership Units specified by such holder in the holders Form of Election
held by such holder into New Partnership Preferred Units. Any such holders
election to receive New Partnership Preferred Units shall be deemed to have
been properly made only if Parent shall have received at its principal
executive office, not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date
that is five (5) Business Days before the scheduled date of the Company
Stockholders Meeting (the " _Election Date_ "), a Form of Election specifying
that such holder elects to receive New Partnership Preferred Units with
respect to the Partnership Units specified by such holder in the holders Form
of Election and otherwise properly completed and signed. The Form of Election
shall state therein the date that constitutes the Election Date. 

(ii) A Form of Election may be revoked by any holder of a
Partnership Unit only by written notice received by Parent prior to 5:00
p.m., New York City time, on the Election Date. In addition, all Forms of
Election shall be automatically revoked if the Partnership Merger has been
abandoned.

 

(iii) The reasonable determination of Parent shall be binding as
to whether or not elections to receive New Partnership Preferred Units have
been properly made or revoked. If Parent determines that any election to
receive New Partnership Preferred Units was not properly made, Parent shall
notify such holder of Partnership Units of the improper election and provide
a reasonable opportunity to such holder to cure the improper election. If,
following such reasonable period, the improperly made election remains
uncured, the Partnership Units with respect to which such election was not
properly made shall be converted into Per Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.2(a)_. Parent may, with the
agreement of the Company, make such rules as are consistent with this 
_Section 2.2(b)_ for the implementation of elections provided for herein as
shall be necessary or desirable to fully effect such elections.

 

(iv) Each eligible holder of Partnership Units, as a condition to making
a Unit Election with respect to such holders Partnership Units subject to a
Unit Election, shall (x) represent to Parent that such holder is (1) an
Accredited Investor (as such term is defined under Rule 501 promulgated under
the Securities Act) and (2) not a "benefit plan investor" within the meaning
of Section 3(42) of ERISA or other plan, account or arrangement (or entity
whose assets constitute the assets of a plan, account or arrangement) that
is subject to any Laws or regulations that are similar to the fiduciary
responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, and (y) agree to be bound by the terms of the
Amended Partnership Agreement as it will be in effect immediately following
the Partnership Merger Effective Time (which agreement shall incorporate the
terms of the New Partnership Preferred Units set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto
and any other terms determined by Parent that are not inconsistent with the
terms of the New Partnership Preferred Units and do not otherwise materially
and adversely affect the holders of New Partnership Preferred Units).

 



8 (v) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries agree to reasonably
cooperate with Parent in preparing any disclosure statement or other
disclosure information to accompany the Form of Election, including
information applicable to an offering of securities exempt from registration
under the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 506 thereunder, each of which shall
be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company.

 

(vi) Promptly after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the
Surviving Partnership shall deliver to each holder of Partnership Units
entitled to receive New Partnership Preferred Units pursuant to the terms of
_Section 2.2(a)_ and _(b)_ , a notice confirming such holders record
ownership of the New Partnership Preferred Units issuable pursuant hereto in
respect of such holders Partnership Units subject to a Unit Election.

 

(vii) Each Person that receives New Partnership Preferred Units
pursuant to the terms of _Section 2.2(a)_ and _(b)_ shall automatically be
admitted as a limited partner of the Surviving Partnership at the Partnership
Merger Effective Time.

 

(c) _Partnership Units Held by the Company and Roll-Over
Limited Partners_. At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, by virtue of
the Partnership Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
partnership interest of the Partnership, (i) each Partnership Unit held by
the Company immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall
be unaffected by the Partnership Merger and shall remain outstanding as
Partnership Units of the Surviving Partnership held by the Company and (ii)
the Roll-Over Limited Partners shall own the number of New Partnership
Preferred Units issued to them in the Partnership Merger.

 

(d) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned and Merger Sub II-Owned Partnership
Units_. At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the
Partnership Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
partnership interest of the Partnership, each Partnership Unit held by Parent,
Merger Sub II or any of their respective Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, with no consideration to be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor.

 

(e) _Cancellation of Merger Sub II Partnership Interests_. At the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Partnership Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder thereof, each partnership
interest in Merger Sub II shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist,
the holders thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, and
no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Equity-Based Awards_.

 

(a) Effective immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
each restricted stock award (each, a " _Company Restricted Stock Award_ ")
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time
shall automatically become fully vested and non-forfeitable, and all Company
Shares represented thereby shall be

 



9  considered outstanding for all purposes of this Agreement and subject to the
right to receive the Per Company Share Merger Consideration (less any
applicable income and employment Taxes).

 

(b) Immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, each
outstanding performance unit (each, a " _Company Performance Unit_ ") shall
automatically become earned and vested with respect to that number of Company
Shares subject to such Company Performance Unit determined in accordance with
the terms of the Company Performance Unit based on the achievement of the
applicable performance goals set forth in the award agreement governing such
Company Performance Unit, as measured from the beginning of the applicable
performance period through the Company Merger Effective Time (each such
earned and vested Company Performance Unit, an " _Earned Unit_ "). At the
Company Merger Effective Time, each Earned Unit shall be canceled and, in
exchange therefor, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to pay to each
former holder of any such canceled Earned Unit within five (5) days following
the Company Merger Effective Time (or at such later time as necessary to avoid
a violation and/or adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code)
an amount in cash (without interest, and less any applicable income and
employment withholding Taxes) equal to the Per Company Share Merger
Consideration for each Earned Unit. For the avoidance of doubt, each Company
Performance Unit that does not become an Earned Unit in accordance with this
_Section 2.3(b)_ shall terminate without consideration immediately prior to
the Company Merger Effective Time.

 

(c) Prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Company shall
deliver all required notices (which notices shall have been approved by
Parent, in its reasonable discretion) to each holder of Company Restricted
Stock Awards, Company Performance Units or Company LTIP Units setting forth
each holders rights pursuant to the Company Share Incentive Plan and, as
applicable, the Partnership Agreement, and stating that such Company
Restricted Stock Awards, Company Performance Units and Company LTIP Units
shall be treated in the manner set forth in _Section 2.2_ or this _Section
2.3_, as applicable.

(d) At or prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Company,
the Partnership, the Company Board or the Company compensation committee, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are
necessary to effectuate the provisions of this  _Section 2.3_. Furthermore,
the Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, (i) as of the
Company Merger Effective Time, the Company Share Incentive Plan and any
agreements thereunder shall terminate and (ii) (x) as of the Company Merger
Effective Time, no holder of a Company Restricted Stock Award or Company
Performance Unit or any participant in the Company Share Incentive Plan and
(y) as of the Partnership Merger Effective Time, no holder of a Company LTIP
Unit shall, in each case have any rights to acquire, or other rights in
respect of, the capital stock or partnership units, as applicable, of Parent,
the Company, the Partnership, the Surviving Company, the Surviving
Partnership or any of their respective Subsidiaries, except the right to
receive the payments contemplated by this _Section 2.3_ in cancellation and
settlement thereof or, in the case of Company LTIP Units, the right to
receive Partnership Unit Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.2_.

 



10 Section 2.4 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the
Company to act as Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for (i) the payment or
exchange in accordance with this  _Article II_ of the Merger Consideration
(other than any New Partnership Preferred Units to be issued in accordance
with this _Article II_ pursuant to the Unit Election, payments in respect of
Earned Units and payments in respect of Company LTIP Units) and (ii) if
Parent wishes the Paying Agent to so act ( _provided_ , _however_ , that if
Parent does not wish for the Paying Agent to so act, Parent shall so act), in
Parents discretion, the exchange of Partnership Units (other than Company
LTIP Units) for New Partnership Preferred Units in accordance with this
_Article II_ pursuant to the Unit Election. At or prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent the cash
portion of the Merger Consideration and, if applicable, immediately following
the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the New Partnership Preferred Units to
be issued in accordance with this _Article II_ pursuant to the Unit Election,
less (A) the Per Company Share Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
Earned Units and (B) the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration to be paid
and any New Partnership Preferred Units to be issued in respect of
Company LTIP Units, which amounts in respect of Earned Units and Company LTIP
Units shall be paid or delivered directly to the Surviving Company (the cash
portion of the Merger Consideration and any such New Partnership Preferred
Units so deposited being referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The
Paying Agent shall make payments of the Merger Consideration out of the
Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement, the Company Merger
Certificate, the Company Merger Articles of Merger and the Partnership Merger
Articles of Merger. The Company shall cooperate with Parent and the Paying
Agent to facilitate an orderly transfer of funds. The Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any other purpose. Any and all interest earned on cash deposited
in the Exchange Fund shall be paid to the Surviving Company.

 

(b) _Share and Unit Transfer Books_. On the Closing Date, the share
transfer books of the Company and the unit transfer books of the Partnership
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of the Company Shares or Partnership Units. From and after the
Closing Date, the holders of certificates representing ownership of the
Company Shares or, if applicable, Partnership Units outstanding immediately
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time or Partnership Merger Effective
Time, as applicable, or any book-entry shares or book-entry
units representing Company Shares or Partnership Units (each such
certificate, book-entry share or book-entry unit, a " _Certificate_ "), shall
cease to have rights with respect to such shares or units, as applicable,
except as otherwise provided for herein. On or after the Closing Date, any
Certificates presented to the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company or the
Surviving Partnership in accordance with this Agreement shall be exchanged for
the Per Company Share Merger Consideration, the Per Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration or New Partnership Preferred Units, as applicable, with respect
to the Company Shares or Partnership Units formerly represented thereby.

 

Section 2.5 _Exchange Procedures._

 



11 (a) _Procedure_. As soon as possible after the Closing Date (but in any
event within five (5) Business Days), the Surviving Company shall (i) cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or
Certificates that, immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
represented outstanding Company Shares or that, immediately prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, represented Partnership Units (other than
Company LTIP Units) whose shares or units, as applicable, were converted into
the right to receive or be exchanged for the Per Company Share Merger
Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or New Partnership
Preferred Units, as applicable, pursuant to _Section 2.1_, _Section 2.2_
and  _Section 2.3(a)_: (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the Certificates or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.5(f)_ to
the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (y)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Per Company Share Merger Consideration, Per Partnership Unit
Merger Consideration or New Partnership Preferred Units, as applicable, to
which the holder thereof is entitled, and (ii) pay (or deliver, as
applicable) the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration and any New
Partnership Preferred Units to be paid or issued to holders of Company LTIP
Units, less any applicable income and employment withholding Taxes.
Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.5(f)_ to the Paying Agent or to
such other agent or agents reasonably satisfactory to the Company as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed
and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per
Company Share Merger Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration
or New Partnership Preferred Units, as applicable, payable in respect of the
Company Shares or Partnership Units, as applicable, previously represented by
such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ , and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Shares or Partnership Units to a Person that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company or Partnership,
payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such
tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 2.5_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Closing Date to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the
Per Company Share Merger Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration or New Partnership Preferred Units, as applicable, as
contemplated by this _Section 2.5_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on
any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

(b) _No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Shares or Partnership
Units_. On the Closing Date, holders of Company Shares or Partnership Units
that are converted into the right to receive Per Company Share Merger
Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or New Partnership
Preferred Units, as applicable, shall cease to be, and shall have no rights
as, stockholders of the Company or limited partners of the

 



12  Partnership other than the right to receive the Per Company Share Merger
Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or New Partnership
Preferred Units, as applicable, provided under this _Article II_. The Per
Company Share Merger Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration
or New Partnership Preferred Units, as applicable, paid or delivered or issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates representing Company Shares
or Partnership Units, in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall
be deemed to have been paid, delivered or issued, as the case may be, in full
satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the Company Shares or
Partnership Units, exchanged therefor.

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for twelve (12)
months after the Closing Date shall be delivered to the Surviving Company and
any holders of Company Shares or Partnership Units prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time or Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable, who
have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Company and only as general creditors thereof for
payment of the Per Company Share Merger Consideration, Per Partnership Unit
Merger Consideration or New Partnership Preferred Units, as applicable, upon
compliance with the procedures set forth in  _Section 2.5(a)_ and subject to
_Section 2.5(d)_.

(d) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub I, the Surviving
Company, the Partnership, Merger Sub II, the Surviving Partnership, the
Company or the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, trustee, director,
agent or affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of
Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of the Certificates immediately prior
to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become the
property of, any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear
of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or
personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

 

(e) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. After the Closing Date,
the Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as
directed by the Surviving Company, on a daily basis. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Company.
Until the termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_, to
the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the cash
portion of the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level
required to make prompt payments of the Company Share Merger Consideration or
the cash portion of the Partnership Unit Merger Consideration as contemplated
hereby, the Surviving Company shall promptly replace or restore the portion of
the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to
make such payments.

 

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent and the taking of such
other actions as may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent, the

 



13  Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and
subject to _Section 2.5(c)_, the Surviving Company) will issue, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Per Company Share Merger
Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or New Partnership
Preferred Units, as applicable, payable in respect thereof, pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

Section 2.6 _Withholding Rights_. The Company, the Surviving
Company, the Surviving Partnership or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment (and, with respect to
the Company Restricted Stock Awards, the Company Performance Units or the
Company LTIP Units, the vesting of such Company Restricted Stock Awards, the
vesting and cancellation of such Company Performance Units or the treatment
of such Company LTIP Units as set forth in _Section 2.2_) under the Code, and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Company, the Surviving Company, the Surviving Partnership or the Paying Agent,
as applicable, and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Company, the Surviving Company, the Surviving
Partnership or the Paying Agent, as applicable.

 

Section 2.7 _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal
rights shall be available with respect to the Mergers.

 

Section 2.8 _Adjustment of Per Company Share Merger Consideration, Per
Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or New Partnership Preferred Units_.
In the event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time or Partnership Merger Effective Time, as
applicable, the Company Shares or the Partnership Units issued and
outstanding shall, through a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other
similar change in the capitalization of the Company or the Partnership, as
applicable, increase or decrease in number or be changed into or exchanged for
a different kind or number of securities, then an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Per Company Share Merger
Consideration, the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration and New
Partnership Preferred Units to provide the holders the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing set forth in this  _Section 2.8_ shall be construed to
supersede or in any way limit the prohibitions set forth in _Section 5.1_
hereof.

Section 3.5 _Company SEC Documents; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Since January 1, 2013, the Company has filed with or otherwise
furnished to (as applicable) the SEC all registration statements,
prospectuses, forms, reports, definitive proxy statements, schedules and

required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the "
_Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") (such documents and any other documents filed by the
Company with the SEC, as have been supplemented, modified or amended since
the time of filing, including those filed or furnished subsequent to the date
hereof, collectively, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective
filing (or furnishing) dates or, if supplemented, modified or amended since
the time of filing, as of the date of the most recent supplement, modification

SEC Documents filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the

to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading and (ii) complied in all material respects
with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as
the case may be, in each case as in effect on the date each such document was
filed with or furnished to the SEC. None of the Company Subsidiaries (other

(as in effect in the United States on the date of such Company Financial
Statement) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited
financial statements, as permitted by SEC rules and regulations) and (ii)
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries and the results of their

over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) intended to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries. The Company has designed disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to provide
reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

Section 3.6 _Information Supplied_. The Proxy Statement will not, at
the time the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Companys stockholders, at
the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting or at the time of any amendment
or supplement thereof, as applicable, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement,
insofar as it relates to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or other
information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein, will comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and
other applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or
warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by Parent,

the Company Subsidiaries has, or is subject to, any liabilities or

of compensation due, to any current or former Service Provider; (ii) increase
any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Employee Benefit Plan; or
(iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment (including the
funding of a trust) or vesting of any compensation or benefits from the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to any current or former Service Provider.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as set forth in 
_Section 3.11(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, no amount payable to any

date of the Company Merger Effective Time, and (iii) has not taken or omitted
to take any action which would reasonably be expected to result in the
Companys

 



26  failure to qualify as a REIT, and no challenge to the Companys status or
qualification as a REIT is pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened
in writing.  _Section 3.13(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
each Company Subsidiary and its classification for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as of the date hereof. Each entity that is listed in _Section
3.13(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter as a partnership, joint venture, or
limited liability company has been since its formation and continues to be
treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded
entity, as the case may be, and not as a corporation or an association
taxable as a corporation. Each entity that is listed in _Section 3.13(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter as a corporation has been since the date listed
in _Section 3.13(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter a "qualified REIT
subsidiary" pursuant to Section 856(i) of the Code or a "taxable REIT
subsidiary" pursuant to Section 856(l) of the Code, which date is in all cases
the later of the date of its formation, the date on which the Company
acquired an interest in such entity, or within thirty (30) days after the
calendar quarter in which the Company acquired an interest in such entity, as
indicated in _Section 3.13(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary holds any asset the disposition of which
would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of the Code (or otherwise
result in any "built-in gains" Tax under Section 337(d) of the Code and the
applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder).

 

(c) Since January 1, 2011, (i) the Company and each of the
Company Subsidiaries have not incurred any liability for Taxes under Sections
857(b), 857(f), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code or Section 337(d) of the Code (and
the applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder) and (ii) neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred any other material liability for
Taxes that have become due and that have not been previously paid other than
in the ordinary course of business. Since January 1, 2011, neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary (other than a "taxable REIT subsidiary" or any
subsidiary of a "taxable REIT subsidiary") has engaged at any time in any
"prohibited transactions" within the meaning of Section 857(b)(6) of the
Code. Since January 1, 2011, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has engaged in any transaction that would give rise to "redetermined rents,
redetermined deductions and excess interest" described in Section 857(b)(7) of
the Code. To the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred, and no
condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any
material Tax described in the preceding sentences will be imposed on the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(d) Except as provided in _Section 3.13(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, there are no Tax Protection Agreements currently in force.

material Tax or Tax matter by any Governmental Entity; (ii) has not received
any notice in writing from any Governmental Entity that such an audit,
examination, investigation or other proceeding is contemplated or pending and
does not have any knowledge that such audit, examination, investigation or
other proceeding is threatened or contemplated; (iii) has not waived any
statute of limitations in respect of material Taxes or agreed to any extension
of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency; (iv) has not

 



27  received a request for waiver of the time to assess any material Taxes,

before any Governmental Entity; (vi) to the knowledge of the Company, is not
subject to a claim or deficiency for any Tax which has not been satisfied by
payment, settled or been withdrawn; (vii) to the knowledge of the Company, is
not subject to a claim by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where the
Company or such Company Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that the Company
or such Company Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction; (viii) has no outstanding requests for any Tax ruling from any
Governmental Entity and has not received a Tax ruling; and (ix) is not the
subject of a "closing agreement" within the meaning of Section 7121 of the
Code (or any comparable agreement under applicable state, local or foreign
Tax Law).

(f) The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries (i) have complied
in all material respects with all applicable Laws, rules and regulations
relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes, (ii) have duly and timely
withheld from employee salaries, wages and other compensation and have paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Entity all material amounts required to
be withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof under all

due from or with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiaries.

(h) Except as set forth in  _Section 3.13(h)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, to the knowledge of the Company (and other than in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), there are no proposed
reassessments of any real property owned by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary that would result in a material increase in the amount of any Tax
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would be subject.

 

(i) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries: (i) has
agreed to make any material adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a) of the
Code, (ii) has any knowledge that the IRS has proposed, in writing, such an
adjustment or a change in accounting method with respect to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or (iii) has any application pending with the IRS or any
other Governmental Entity requesting permission for any change in accounting
method.

 

(j) Except as set forth in _Section 3.13(j)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any other Person on behalf of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary has requested any extension of time within which to
file any income Tax Return, which income Tax Return has since not been filed.

 



28 (k) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any Tax

arrangement, other than (i) the Tax Protection Agreements listed in _Section
3.13(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, (ii) customary Tax indemnification
provisions in commercial Contracts entered into in the ordinary course of
business not primarily relating to Taxes and (iii) any agreement or
arrangement between the Company and any Company Subsidiary, pursuant to which
it has any obligation to make any payments after the Closing.

 

(l) The Company has set forth in _Section 3.13(l)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter a list of all Reportable Transactions in which the Company
or any Company Subsidiary has participated. Each of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have disclosed to the IRS on the appropriate Tax Returns
any Reportable Transaction in which it has participated. Each of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries have retained all documents and other records
pertaining to any Reportable Transaction in which it has participated,
including documents and other records listed in Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(g) and any other documents and other records which are related to any
Reportable Transaction in which it has participated but not listed in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4(g).

 

(m) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been a

which Section 355 of the Code is applicable.

 

(n) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary: (i) is or has ever

claim, action or proceeding to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a

Section 4.7 _Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II_.

 



40 (a) All of the issued and outstanding limited partnership interests of
Merger Sub I are, and immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time
will be, owned by Parent. Merger Sub I GP, is, and immediately prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time will be, the sole general partner of Merger Sub
I. Merger Sub I was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated hereby, and it has not conducted any business prior
to the date hereof and has no, and prior to the Company Merger Effective Time
will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than
those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) All of the issued and outstanding limited partnership interests of
Merger Sub II are, and immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective
Time will be, owned by Merger Sub I or its direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary to be designated by Parent prior to the Partnership Merger
Effective Time. Merger Sub II GP, is, and immediately prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time will be, the sole general partner of Merger
Sub II. Merger Sub II was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated hereby, and it has not conducted any business prior
to the date hereof and has no, and prior to the Partnership Merger Effective
Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than
those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Merger Sub II is not treated as
a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

 

(c) None of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II or any of their
respective Subsidiaries owns any Excluded Shares or beneficially owns (as
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) any Company Shares or
Partnership Units or any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable
or exercisable for Company Shares or Partnership Units, or holds any rights
to acquire or vote any Company Shares or Partnership Units, other than
pursuant to this Agreement. None of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, or the "affiliates" or, to the
knowledge of Parent, the "associates" of any such Person, is, nor at any time
during the last five (5) years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the
Company, in each case as defined in Section 3-601 of the MGCL.

Section 4.8 _Sufficient Funds_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of the
executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Equity
Commitment Letter_ "), between Parent and the other party thereto (the "
_Equity Financing Source_ "), pursuant to which the Equity Financing Source
has committed, subject only to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest
the amounts set forth therein on the Closing Date (the " _Equity Financing_
").

 

(b) Assuming the Equity Financing is funded in accordance with the Equity
Commitment Letter, the accuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement and performance in all material respects by the
Company and the Partnership of their obligations under this Agreement, at the
Closing, Parent will have sufficient cash on hand to enable it to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, pay the Merger Consideration,
satisfy all of its other obligations under this Agreement and pay all related
out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including any obligations of the Surviving
Company, the

 



41  Surviving Partnership or their respective Subsidiaries (including the
Company Subsidiaries)) which become due or payable by the Surviving Company,
the Surviving Partnership or any of such Subsidiaries in connection with, or
as a result of, the Mergers and any repayment or refinancing of Indebtedness
required in connection therewith.

 

(c) The Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not
been (and will not be prior to the Closing or valid termination of this
Agreement) withdrawn, terminated or rescinded or otherwise amended,
supplemented or modified (or is contemplated to be amended, supplemented or
modified) in any respect. The Equity Commitment Letter, in the form delivered
to the Company, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Parent and the
Equity Financing Source, enforceable against Parent and the Equity Financing
Source in accordance with and subject to its terms and conditions, except as
enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. There
are no side letters or other Contracts or arrangements relating to the Equity
Commitment Letter. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, could constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent
under any term, or a failure of any condition, of the Equity Commitment Letter
or otherwise result in any portion of the Equity Financing contemplated
thereby to be unavailable on the date on which the Closing should occur
pursuant to _Section 1.5_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement, the performance in all material
respects by the Company and the Partnership of their obligations under this
Agreement and satisfaction of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section
6.1_ and _Section 6.2_, Parent has no reason to believe that it or the Equity
Financing Source would be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or
condition of the Equity Commitment Letter required to be satisfied by it.
Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by
the Equity Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date of this
Agreement. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to
the investing of the full amount of the Equity Financing, other than as
expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter.

 

Section 4.9 _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered the Guaranty to the Company. The Guaranty is
in full force and effect and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of
the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with and
subject to its terms and conditions, except as enforceability may be limited
by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. No event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, could constitute a default on the part
of the Guarantor under such Guaranty. The provisions of this _Section 4.9_
do not limit the express representations of the Guarantor contained in the
Guaranty.

 

Section 4.10 _Solvency_. Assuming that (a) the conditions to the
obligation of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II to consummate the Mergers
have been satisfied or waived, (b) the representations and warranties set
forth in _Article III_ are true and correct, and (c) the financial
projections or forecasts provided by the Company to Parent prior to the date
hereof have been prepared in good faith on assumptions that were and continue
to be reasonable, then at and immediately following the Company Merger
Effective Time and after giving effect to all of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the funding of the Equity Financing,
Parent, the Surviving Company and each Subsidiary of the Surviving Company,
including the 

 



42  Surviving Partnership, will be Solvent. Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub
II are not entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with
the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors.

Section 4.11 _Absence of Certain Arrangements_. None of Parent,
Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II nor any of their affiliates has entered into any
Contract with any bank or investment bank or other potential provider of debt
or equity financing on an exclusive basis in connection with any transaction
involving the Company or the Partnership (or otherwise on terms that would
prohibit such provider from providing or seeking to provide such financing to
any third party in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries), except for such actions to which the Company
has previously agreed in writing. Other than this Agreement, the Guaranty and
the Confidentiality Agreement, as of the date hereof, there are no Contracts
or any commitments to enter into any Contract between Parent, Merger Sub I or
Merger Sub II or any of their respective controlled affiliates, on the one
hand, and any director, officer, employee or stockholder of the Company or
the Partnership, on the other hand, relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the operations of the Surviving Company after the Company
Merger Effective Time or the Surviving Partnership after the Partnership
Merger Effective Time. 

Section 4.12 _Acknowledgement of No Other Representations and
Warranties_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II expressly
acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in _Article III_ , none of the Company, the Partnership,
the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates or
Representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty, either
express or implied, concerning the Company, the Partnership or the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, operations, assets,
liabilities, results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise) or
prospects or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, except with respect to the representations
and warranties contained in _Article III_ or any breach of any covenant or
other agreement of the Company or the Partnership contained herein, none of
the Company, the Partnership, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective affiliates, employees, stockholders or any other Person or their
Representatives shall have any liability to Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub
II or their respective affiliates or Representatives on any basis (including
in contract or tort, under federal or state securities Laws or otherwise)
based upon any information or statements (or any omissions therefrom) provided
or made available by the Company, the Partnership, the Company Subsidiaries or
their respective affiliates or Representatives to Parent, Merger Sub I,
Merger Sub II or their respective affiliates and Representatives in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby.

of the Company or the Partnership prior to the Company Merger Effective Time
or the Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable. Prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time or the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Company or
the Partnership, as applicable, shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete unilateral control and supervision
over its business operations.

Section 5.2 _Access to Information_.

(a) During the Interim Period, the Company shall, and shall cause each
Company Subsidiary to, (i) give Parent and its authorized Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, and upon reasonable advance
notice, to all properties, facilities, personnel and books and records of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the operation of any business conducted by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary and (ii) permit such inspections as Parent may
reasonably require and promptly furnish Parent with such financial and
operating data and other information with respect to the business, properties
and personnel of the Company and each Company Subsidiary as Parent may

reasonable procedures as they may establish; and _provided_ _further_ that the
Company shall not be required to (or to cause any Company Subsidiary to)
afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that the Company
believes in good faith that doing so would: (i) result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege; (ii) violate any obligations of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary with respect to confidentiality to any third party or
otherwise breach, contravene or violate any then effective Contract to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is party; (iii) result in a competitor
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary receiving information that is
competitively sensitive; or (iv) breach, contravene or violate any applicable
Law ( _provided_ that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to

events set out in clauses (i) through (iv)). No investigation under this
_Section 5.2(a)_ or otherwise shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the Company or the Partnership or the conditions
to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement and shall not limit or
otherwise affect the rights or remedies available hereunder.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto will hold and will cause its authorized
Representatives to hold in confidence all documents and information

may disclose Confidential Information (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) subject to the confidentiality and use restrictions applicable to
"Representatives" (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) set

not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, and (ii) Parents
potential debt financing sources.

 

Section 5.3 _Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare a proxy statement (together with any amendments thereof
or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and, after consultation
with, and approval by, Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), file the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain and furnish the information
required to be included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement, respond, after
consultation with Parent, promptly to any comments made by the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement; and (ii) promptly upon the earlier of (x)
receiving notification that the SEC is not reviewing the preliminary Proxy
Statement and (y) the conclusion of any SEC review of the preliminary Proxy
Statement, cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys
stockholders and, if necessary, after the definitive Proxy Statement shall
have been so mailed, promptly circulate amended or supplemental
proxy materials and, if required in connection therewith, resolicit proxies;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such amended or supplemental proxy materials
will be filed with the SEC or mailed by the Company without affording Parent a
reasonable opportunity for consultation and review, and the Company shall
consider in good faith any comments on such materials reasonably proposed by
Parent. The Company will promptly notify Parent of the receipt of comments
from the SEC and of any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to
the preliminary Proxy Statement or definitive Proxy Statement or for
additional information, and will promptly supply Parent with copies of all
written correspondence between the Company or its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to
the preliminary Proxy Statement, the definitive Proxy Statement, the Mergers
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to
responding to any comments of the SEC or members of its staff, the Company
shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to consult and review such
response and the Company shall consider in good faith any comments on such
response reasonably proposed by Parent. Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub
II will cooperate with the Company in connection with the preparation of the
Proxy Statement, including furnishing to the Company any and all information
regarding Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II and their respective
affiliates as may be required to be disclosed therein. The Proxy Statement
shall contain the Company Recommendation, except to the extent that the
Company Board shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, as
permitted by and determined in accordance with _Section 5.6_.

 

(b) If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting any event
or circumstance relating to the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or directors, should be discovered
by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, which, pursuant to Exchange Act,
should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement,
so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading,

 



50  the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other
party hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the Companys stockholders. All documents that
the Company is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the
Mergers will comply as to form and substance in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

 

Section 5.4 _Company Stockholders  Meeting_. The Company shall,
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the
SEC for mailing to the Companys stockholders in accordance with _Section
5.3(a)_, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the holders
of the Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") for the
purpose of seeking the Company Requisite Vote. The Company, through the
Company Board, shall recommend to holders of the Company Common Stock that
they give the Company Requisite Vote (the " _Company Recommendation_ ") and
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit the Company Requisite
Vote (including by soliciting proxies from the Companys stockholders),
except in each case to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected
an Adverse Recommendation Change, as permitted by and determined in accordance
with _Section 5.6_. The Company shall keep Parent updated with respect to
proxy solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent. Unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not
submit to the vote of its stockholders any Company Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting after
consultation with Parent (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
holders of Company Common Stock within a reasonable amount of time in advance
of a vote on this Agreement and the Company Merger or (B) if additional time
is reasonably required to solicit proxies in favor of the approval of this
Agreement and the Company Merger; _provided_ , that, in the case of this
clause (B), without the consent of Parent, in no event shall the Company
Stockholders Meeting (as so postponed or adjourned) be held on a date that
is more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the Company
Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled. Unless this Agreement shall
have been terminated in accordance with  _Article VII_ , the obligation of
the Company to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting and mail the Proxy Statement (and any amendment or
supplement thereto that may be required by Law) to the Companys stockholders
shall not be affected by an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

Section 5.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of
the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Mergers; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding; (iii) promptly
inform the other parties of any communication to or from any Governmental
Entity or third party regarding the Mergers; and (iv) promptly furnish the
other with copies of notices or other communications received by Parent or
the Company, as the case may be, or any of their Subsidiaries, from any third
party or any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Each party hereto will have the right to review in

 



51  advance, and each party will consult and cooperate with the other parties
and will consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection
with, any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding, each party
hereto will permit authorized Representatives of the other parties to be
present at each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have access to and be
consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding. 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party
hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the Mergers and
to cause to be satisfied all conditions precedent to its obligations under
this Agreement, including, consistent with the foregoing, (i) preparing and
filing as promptly as practicable with the objective of being in a position
to consummate the Mergers as promptly as practicable following the date of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, all documentation to effect all necessary or
advisable applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other documents and
to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, waivers, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, rulings, authorizations and clearances
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Governmental Entity or third
party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any that are required to be obtained under any federal, state or
local Law (including filings, if any, required under the HSR Act) or Contract
to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which any of
their respective properties or assets are bound, (ii) defending all lawsuits
or other legal proceedings against it or any of its affiliates relating to
or challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers ("
_Transaction Litigation_ "), and (iii) effecting all necessary or advisable
registrations and other filings required under the Exchange Act or any other
federal, state or local Law relating to the Mergers. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any consents
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from any
Person (other than from a Governmental Entity) (i) without the prior written
consent of Parent, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall pay or
commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any
cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or
other obligation and (ii) none of Parent or any of its affiliates shall be
required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is
being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur
any liability or other obligations. In the event that the Company fails to
obtain any such consent, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts, and shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent,
to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and Parent and their
respective affiliates and businesses resulting, or which would reasonably be
expected to result, after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, from the
failure to obtain such consent.

(c) Each party shall keep the other parties reasonably informed
regarding any Transaction Litigation unless doing so would, in the reasonable
judgment of such party, jeopardize any privilege of the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries with respect thereto. The Company shall promptly advise Parent
orally and in writing of the initiation of and

 



52  any material developments regarding, and shall reasonably consult with and
permit Parent and its Representatives to participate in the defense,
negotiations or settlement of, any Transaction Litigation, and the Company
shall give consideration to Parents advice with respect to such Transaction
Litigation. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Company
Subsidiaries nor any of its or their Representatives to, compromise, settle
or come to a settlement arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation or
consent thereto unless Parent shall otherwise consent in writing (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

(d) Each of the Company and Parent shall (i) take all action necessary so
that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to Parent, Merger Sub I,
Merger Sub II, this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) if any Takeover Statute becomes applicable to
Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, this Agreement, the Mergers or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby, take all action necessary so that
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on Parent, Merger
Sub I, Merger Sub II, this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent
and use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the New
York Stock Exchange to cause the delisting of the Company Common Stock from
the New York Stock Exchange as promptly as practicable after the Company
Merger Effective Time and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under
the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.

Section 5.6 _Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals;
Adverse Recommendation Change_.

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this  _Section 5.6_, (i) from
and after the date of this Agreement, the Company agrees that it shall, and
shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and its and their officers and
directors to, and shall direct its and their other Representatives to,
immediately cease any solicitations, discussions, negotiations or
communications with any Person that may be ongoing with respect to any Company
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) during the Interim Period, the Company
agrees that it shall not, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries
and its and their officers and directors not to, and shall not authorize and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and their other
Representatives, not to, directly or indirectly through another Person, (A)
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry,
discussion, offer or request that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal (an " _Inquiry_ "), (B) engage in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any third party any
non-public information in connection with, or knowingly facilitate in any way
any effort by, any third party in furtherance of any Company Acquisition
Proposal or Inquiry, (C) approve or recommend a Company Acquisition Proposal,
(D) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, share purchase agreement,
asset purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement or other
similar definitive agreement providing for or relating to a Company
Acquisition Proposal

 



53  or requiring the Company or the Partnership to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any of the
foregoing referred in this clause (D), an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ "), or (E) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.6_ but
subject to the Companys compliance with provisions of this _Section 5.6_,
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company may,
directly or indirectly, through any Representative, in response to an
unsolicited written  _bona fide_ Company Acquisition Proposal by a third
party made after the date of this Agreement (that did not result from a breach
of this _Section 5.6_, it being agreed that the Company Board may correspond
in writing with any Person making such a written Company Acquisition Proposal
to request clarification of the terms and conditions thereof so as to
determine whether such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal) (i) furnish non-public
information to such third party (and such third partys Representatives)
making such Company Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that (A)
prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives from the third
party an executed confidentiality agreement on customary terms no more
favorable in any material respect to such Person than the Confidentiality
Agreement (such confidentiality agreement, an " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), and (B) any non-public information concerning the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries that is provided to such third party (or its
Representatives) shall, to the extent not previously provided to Parent,
be provided to Parent as promptly as practicable after providing it to such
third party (and in any event within 48 hours thereafter)), and (ii) engage in
discussions or negotiations with such third party (and such third
partys Representatives) with respect to the Company Acquisition Proposal if,
in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.

 

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than
48 hours) after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any request
for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary by
any third party that informs the Company that it is considering making, or has
made, a Company Acquisition Proposal, or any Inquiry from any Person seeking
to have discussions or negotiations with the Company relating to a possible
Company Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed
in writing, and shall identify the Person making such Company Acquisition
Proposal or Inquiry and shall indicate the material terms and conditions of
any Company Acquisition Proposals, Inquiries, proposals or offers, to the
extent known (including, if applicable, providing copies of any written
Inquiries, requests, proposals or offers and any proposed agreements related
thereto, which may be redacted to the extent necessary to protect confidential
information of the business or operations of the Person making such
Company Acquisition Proposals, Inquiries, proposals or offers). The Company
shall also promptly, and in any event within 48 hours, notify Parent, orally
and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any
Company Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information to any Person
in accordance with _Section 5.6(b)_, notify Parent of any change to the
financial and other material terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition
Proposal and otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and
terms of any such proposals, offers, discussions or

 



54  negotiations on a current basis, including by providing a copy of all
proposals, offers, drafts of proposed agreements or correspondence relating
thereto. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall, after the date
of this Agreement, enter into any confidential or similar agreement that would
prohibit it from providing such information to Parent.

 

(d) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.6(d)_, neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or
qualify in any manner adverse to Parent (or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent), the Company
Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt or recommend (or publicly propose to
approve, adopt or recommend) any Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to
include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any of the actions
described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this _Section 5.6(d)_, an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (iv) approve, adopt, declare advisable
or recommend (or agree to, resolve or propose to approve, adopt, declare
advisable or recommend), or cause or permit the Company to enter into, any
Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement entered into in accordance with this _Section 5.6_).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company Board shall be
permitted to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change (x) upon the incurrence
of an Intervening Event that the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors duties
under applicable Law, or (y) if the Company Board has received an
unsolicited written _bona fide_ Company Acquisition Proposal (and the Company
is not in breach of this _Section 5.6_) that, in the good faith determination
of the Company Board, after consultation with outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after having complied
with, and giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by
Parent pursuant to _Section 5.6(e)_, and such Company Acquisition Proposal is
not withdrawn.

 

(e) The Company Board shall only be entitled to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change as permitted under _Section 5.6(d)_ if (i) the Company
has provided a prior written notice (a " _Notice of Change of Recommendation_
") to Parent that the Company intends to take such action, identifying the
Person making the Superior Proposal and describing the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, that
is the basis of such action, including, if applicable, copies of any written
proposals or offers and any proposed agreements related to a Superior
Proposal (it being agreed that the delivery of the Notice of Change of
Recommendation by the Company shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation
Change), (ii) during the three (3) Business Day period following Parents
receipt of the Notice of Change of Recommendation, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to
the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, so that, in the case of a Superior Proposal,
such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, or, in the
case of an Intervening Event, in order to obviate the need to make such
Adverse Recommendation Change; and (iii) following the end of the three (3)
Business Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, taking
into account any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent in
response to the Notice of Change of Recommendation or otherwise, that

 



55  (A) the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Change of
Recommendation continues to constitute a Superior Proposal or (B) in the case
of an Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors duties under applicable Law. Any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material amendment of such a Superior Proposal
shall require a new Notice of Change of Recommendation, and the Company shall
be required to comply again with the requirements of this _Section 5.6(e)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that references to the three (3) Business Day period
above shall then be deemed to be references to a two (2) Business Day period
following receipt by Parent of any such new Notice of Change of
Recommendation.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.6_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board, directly or
indirectly through its Representatives, from (i) disclosing to the Companys
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors
duties under applicable Law (for the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that
the issuance by the Company or the Company Board of a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9
and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute an
Adverse Recommendation Change) or is required by applicable Law;  _provided_
, _however_ , that neither the Company nor the Company Board shall be
permitted to recommend that the stockholders of the Company tender any
securities in connection with any tender offer or exchange offer that is a
Company Acquisition Proposal or effect an Adverse Recommendation Change with
respect thereto, except as permitted by _Section 5.6(d)_.

 

(g) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Company Subsidiary
to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any standstill or
confidentiality agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party, except to allow the applicable party to make a Company Acquisition
Proposal to the Company Board. The Company and the Company Board shall not
take any actions to exempt any person from the "Aggregate Stock Ownership
Limit" or the "Common Stock Ownership Limit" or establish or increase an
"Excepted Holder Limit," as such terms are defined in the Company Charter
unless such actions are taken concurrently with the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(c)(i)_.

 

Section 5.7 _Resignations_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at the Closing evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation or removal effective as
of the Company Merger Effective Time, of those directors (or persons
occupying similar positions in any limited liability company or other entity)
and/or officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary designated by Parent
to the Company in writing at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the resignation or removal of any such
officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall not, in and of itself,
constitute a resignation or termination of such officers employment with the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, as applicable, for any purpose, and shall
not affect any rights that such officer may have with respect to severance
payments and benefits in the event of

 



56  a termination of the officers employment in connection with a change in
control of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making
any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Mergers and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior consent of the other party; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may,
without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make
such public statement as may be required by applicable Law or the applicable
rules of any stock exchange or quotation system if the party issuing such
press release or making such public statement has provided the other party
with an opportunity to review and comment (and the parties shall cooperate as
to the timing and contents of any such press release or public statement)
upon any such press release or public statement; _provided_ _further_ that
such consultation and consent shall not be required with respect to any
release, communication or announcement in connection with an Adverse
Recommendation Change made in accordance with this Agreement.

 

Section 5.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership to, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current
or former director or officer of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and each fiduciary under benefit plans of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries (each an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively,
the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against (i) all losses, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, claims, damages
or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the next sentence, amounts paid
in settlement, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Company Merger Effective Time (and whether asserted or claimed prior to,
at or after the Company Merger Effective Time) to the extent that they are
based on or arise out of the fact that such person is or was a director,
officer or fiduciary under benefit plans, including payment on behalf of or
advancement to the Indemnified Party of any expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such
indemnification and/or advancement (the " _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), and
(ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they are based on or arise out
of or pertain to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Company Merger Effective Time,
and including any expenses incurred in enforcing such persons rights under
this _Section 5.9_; _provided_ , that (x) none of the Surviving Company or
the Surviving Partnership shall be liable for any settlement effected
without their prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); and (y) except for legal counsel engaged
for one or more Indemnified Parties on the date hereof, none of the Surviving
Company or the Surviving Partnership shall be obligated under this _Section
5.9(a)_ to pay the fees and expenses of more than one legal counsel (selected
by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified
Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single legal action except to
the extent that, on the advice of any such Indemnified Partys counsel, two or
more of such Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting interests in the
outcome of such action. In the event of any such loss, expense, claim, damage
or liability (whether or not asserted before the Company Merger Effective
Time), the Surviving Company or the Surviving

 



57  Partnership, as applicable, shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties promptly, and in any event within
ten (10) days, after statements therefor are received and otherwise advance
to such Indemnified Party upon request, reimbursement of documented expenses
reasonably incurred ( _provided_ that, if legally required, the person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advance if it is
determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction that such person is not legally entitled to indemnification under
applicable Law).

 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to maintain the Companys
officers and directors liability insurance policies (accurate and complete
copies of which have been previously provided to Parent) in effect on the date
hereof (the " _D andO Insurance_") for a period of not less than six (6)
years after the Closing Date; _provided_ that the Surviving Company may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms no less advantageous to such former directors or officers so
long as such substitution does not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with
respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time;
_provided_ _further_ that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Company be
required to pay annual premiums in the aggregate of more than an amount equal
to 300% of the current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance
(the " _Maximum Amount_ "), to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant
hereto; _provided_   _further_ that if the amount of the annual premiums
necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum
Amount, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to procure and maintain for
such six-year period as much coverage as can be reasonably obtained for the
Maximum Amount. Parent shall have the option to cause coverage to be extended
under the Companys DandO Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy or
policies on terms and conditions no less advantageous than the Companys
existing DandO Insurance, subject to the limitations set forth in the provisos
above in this _Section 5.9(b)_, and such "tail" policy or policies shall
satisfy the provisions of this  _Section 5.9(b)_.

(c) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this
_Section 5.9_ shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the Mergers
and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 5.9_
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9_, each of
whom (including his or her heirs, executors or administrators and his or
her Representatives, successors and assigns) may enforce the provisions of
this _Section 5.9_) without the consent of the Indemnified Party (including
the successors, assigns and heirs of such Indemnified Party) affected thereby.
In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets
to any Person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Company, then, and in each
such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Company shall assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

(d) For a period of not less than six (6) years from the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership shall
provide to

 



58  the Indemnified Parties the same rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses as provided to the Indemnified Parties under the
provisions of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries charter, bylaws or
similar organizational documents as in effect as of the date hereof and the
Surviving Companys and the Surviving Partnerships charter, bylaws or similar
organizational documents shall not contain any provisions contradictory to
such rights. The contractual indemnification rights set forth in _Section
5.9(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter in existence on the date of this
Agreement with any of the current or former directors, officers or employees
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be assumed by the Surviving
Company and the Surviving Partnership without any further action, and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms following
the Company Merger Effective Time.

(e) The provisions of this  _Section 5.9_ are in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such person may have by contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement,
including this _Section 5.9_, is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company, any Company Subsidiaries or the Indemnified Parties, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section
5.9_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such
policies.

 

Section 5.10 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, for the period
ending on the first anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time (or, if
shorter, during any applicable period of employment), Parent shall provide or
cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company and the Surviving
Partnership, to provide (i) to each individual who is an employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time and who continues employment with the Surviving Company or any
Subsidiary of the Surviving Company following the Company Merger Effective
Time (including, upon their return to active employment, employees who are not
actively at work on account of illness, disability or leave of absence) (each,
a " _Company Employee_ "), base salary at a rate that is no less favorable
than the rate of base salary provided to such Company Employee immediately
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, (ii) to each Company Employee, an
annual cash bonus opportunity that is no less favorable than the annual
cash bonus opportunity provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to
the Company Merger Effective Time, and (iii) to the Company Employees,
collectively, other compensation and benefits (including severance benefits,
paid-time off and health insurance) that are substantially comparable, in the
aggregate, to the other compensation and benefits (excluding equity-based
compensation, restricted cash awards and other long-term compensation)
provided to the Company Employees, collectively, immediately prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time.

(b) With respect to each benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement
maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company and
the Surviving Partnership, following the Closing and in which any of the
Company Employees participate (each, a " _Parent Plan_ "), and except to the
extent necessary to avoid duplication of benefits,

 



59  service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary and the predecessor of
any of them shall be treated as service with Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership,
for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting (if
applicable) and entitlement to benefits including any paid time off and
severance plans (but not for accrual of or entitlement to pension
benefits, post-employment welfare benefits, special or early retirement
programs, window separation programs, or similar plans which may be in effect
from time to time), to the extent such service was recognized by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary as of the date hereof. Parent shall take all
necessary actions so that each Company Employee shall after the Company Merger
Effective Time continue to be credited with the unused paid time off credited
to such employee through the Company Merger Effective Time under the
applicable paid time off policies of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries
(subject to the same forfeiture conditions and accrual limits applicable prior
to the Company Merger Effective Time).

 

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership, as the case may be, to (i)
waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions, actively at
work requirements, waiting periods or any other restriction that would prevent
immediate or full participation under the health and welfare plans of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries applicable to such Company Employee with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to all Company Employees
and their dependents under any Parent Plan that is a welfare plan that such
Company Employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date,
other than limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements, waiting
periods or other restrictions that are already in effect with respect to such
employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date under any
Company Employee Benefit Plan and (ii) provide each such Company Employee and
his or her dependents with full credit for any co-payments and deductibles
satisfied prior to the Closing Date for the plan year within which the
Company Merger Effective Time occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible
or out-of-pocket requirements, and for any lifetime maximums, under any
welfare plans that such employees are eligible to participate in after the
Closing Date.

(d) At and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company and the Surviving Partnership to honor in accordance with their terms
the agreements listed in _Section 5.10(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(e) If the Company Merger Effective Time occurs prior to the date on
which the Company pays annual bonuses for the 2015 performance year, then
within fifteen (15) days following the Company Merger Effective Time, the
Company shall pay a bonus to each employee of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary who is otherwise eligible to receive such a bonus for 2015 (the "
_2015 Bonus_ "). The amount of any such 2015 Bonus shall be calculated in good
faith (i) with respect to quantitative performance, based on the actual
performance of the Company and the Company Employee through the Company
Merger Effective Time (or, if earlier, December 31, 2015) and (ii) with
respect to qualitative performance, assuming maximum performance.

 

(f) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.6_, no provision of
this  _Section 5.10_, express or implied, (i) is intended to confer any
rights, benefits, remedies,

 



60  obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person (including any Company
Employee and any dependent or beneficiary thereof) other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns, (ii) shall constitute an
amendment of, or an undertaking to amend, any Company Employee Benefit Plan or
any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or (iii) is intended to prevent Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any Company Employee Benefit Plan in
accordance with its terms or terminating the employment of any Company
Employee.

 

Section 5.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement,
the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, if (i) any representation or warranty made by
it contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that the
applicable closing conditions would reasonably be expected to be incapable of
being satisfied by the Outside Date or (ii) it fails to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of
the parties under this Agreement and shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

Section 5.12 _Dividends_. During the Interim Period, the Company
may make distributions to its stockholders and the Partnership may make
distributions to the Company to allow the Company to make distributions to its
stockholders, in each case (a) reasonably necessary for the Company to
maintain its status as a REIT under the Code, (b) to avoid the payment of
income or excise tax under Sections 857 or 4981 of the Code or (c) in
accordance with _clause (ii)(B)_ of _Section 5.1(c)_. If the Company declares
a distribution pursuant to  _clause (a)_ or _(b)_ of the immediately
preceding sentence, the Per Company Share Merger Consideration shall be
decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of such distribution.

 

Section 5.13 _Taxes_.

 

(a) REIT Matters. The Company shall take all actions, and refrain from
taking all actions, as are necessary to ensure that the Company (i) will
qualify for taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for its
current taxable year and any other taxable year that includes the Closing
Date, and (ii) will not become liable for U.S. federal income Tax under
Section 857(b) or 4981 of the Code. During the Interim Period, the Company
shall accommodate all reasonable requests of Parent with respect to
maintenance of the Companys REIT status for the Companys 2015 taxable year
and, if applicable, 2016 taxable year.

 



61 (b) _Mitigation of Taxes_. Parent and the Company shall, upon written
request, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including with respect to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement).

 

(c) _FIRPTA Certificate_. On the Closing Date, prior to the Company
Merger, the Company shall deliver to Merger Sub I a duly executed certificate
of non-foreign status, dated as of the Closing Date, substantially in the form
of the sample certification set forth in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B).

 

Section 5.14 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted to take such steps as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable to cause dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the Mergers by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.15 _Other Transactions_. Parent shall have the option, in
its sole discretion and without requiring the further consent of any of the
Company, the Company Board or any board of trustees, board of directors,
stockholders, members or partners of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, upon reasonable notice to the Company, to request that the
Company, immediately prior to the Closing, (a) convert or cause the conversion

corporations into limited liability companies and one or more Company
Subsidiaries that are organized as limited partnerships into limited liability
companies, on the basis of organizational documents as reasonably requested by
Parent, (b) sell or cause to be sold stock, partnership interests, limited
liability company interests or other equity interests owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company in one or more wholly-owned Company Subsidiaries at
a price and on such other terms as designated by Parent, and (c) sell or
cause to be sold any of the assets of the Company or one or more wholly-owned
Company Subsidiaries at a price and on such other terms as designated by
Parent or exercise any right of the Company or a Company Subsidiary to
terminate or cause to be terminated any Contract to which the Company or a
Company Subsidiary is a party; _provided_ , that (i) neither the Company nor
any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action in
contravention of (A) any organizational document of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, (B) any Company Material Contract, or (C) applicable
Law, (ii) any such actions or transactions shall be contingent upon all of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ having been satisfied (or, with respect
to _Section 6.2_, waived) and receipt by the Company of a written notice from
Parent to such effect and that Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II are
prepared to proceed immediately with the Closing and any other evidence
reasonably requested by the Company that the Closing will occur (it being
understood that in any event the transactions described in clauses (a), (b)
and (c) will be deemed to have occurred prior to the Closing), (iii) such
actions (or the inability to complete such actions) shall not affect or modify
in any respect the obligations of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II under
this Agreement, including the amount of or timing of payment of the Merger
Consideration, (iv) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries
shall be required to take any such action that could adversely affect the
classification of the Company as a REIT or could subject the Company to any
"prohibited transactions" taxes or other material

 



62  Taxes under Code Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 and (v) neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to take any such action that
could result in any United States federal, state or local income Tax being
imposed on the non-managing members of the Partnership. Such actions or
transactions shall be undertaken in the manner (including in the order)
specified by Parent which actions or transactions shall be implemented
immediately prior to or concurrent with the Closing. Without limiting the
foregoing, none of the representations, warranties or covenants of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed
breached or violated by, any of the transactions contemplated by this
_Section 5.15_ or required by Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.15_. Parent
shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries in performing their obligations under this _Section 5.15_, and
Parent shall indemnify the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for any and
all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries arising therefrom (and in the event the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, Parent
shall promptly reimburse the Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries not previously
reimbursed).

 

Section 5.16 _Cooperating Regarding Existing Loans_.

 

(a) Promptly following Parents request, the Company shall deliver to
each of its and the Company Subsidiaries lenders under the Existing Loan
Documents (and any other party whose consent is required under the Existing
Loan Documents) (the " _Existing Lenders_ ") a notice prepared by Parent, in
form and substance reasonably approved by the Company, requesting that such
Existing Lender deliver to Parent a written statement or documents (the "
_Assumption Documents_ ") (i) confirming (A) that, other than the Existing
Loan Documents, there are no documents or agreements to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is currently bound in favor of such Existing Lender
with respect to the Existing Indebtedness, (B) the amount of the Existing
Indebtedness, (C) the date to which interest and principal has been paid, and
(D) the amount of any escrows being held by such Existing Lender under the
Existing Loan Documents; and (ii) consenting to (A) the assumption of the
Existing Indebtedness and the consummation of the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (B) to the modifications of
the Existing Loan Documents that Parent may reasonably request after the date
hereof; _provided_ that the Company shall be informed of any such request or
modification; _provided_ , _further_ , that, in the event Parent requests
Assumption Documents in accordance with this _Section 5.16_, (x) the
consummation of the Mergers shall not be conditioned on, or delayed or
postponed as a result of the receipt of (or failure to receive) such
Assumption Documents from all or any portion of the Existing Lenders and (y)
the Assumption Documents will be effective as of or immediately prior to and
conditioned on the occurrence of the Partnership Merger Effective Time.
Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with any indebtedness that
Parent intends not to repay or cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
not to repay at the Closing, the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries
shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in connection with maintaining such
continuing indebtedness. In furtherance of the foregoing, at the option of
Parent, (1) Parent shall have the right to approach any such lender regarding
maintaining the indebtedness (provided that the Company is provided a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the

 



63  discussions and Parent shall provide the Company with updates on the status
of discussions upon the Companys reasonable request) and make all
determinations and decisions regarding such indebtedness and any payment of
costs or fees relating thereto and (2) the Company shall provide Parent with
reasonable access to any such lender and shall, if required by Parent, provide
reasonable cooperation in connection with such indebtedness, in each case, in
the same manner and with the same conditions as provided in _Section
5.17(a)_.

 

(b) Parent shall pay all fees and expenses payable in connection with the
Assumption Documents, including premiums for any endorsements to or re-date
of the title insurance policy previously issued to the Existing Lenders,
servicing fees, rating agency fees, assignment and assumption fees, attorneys
fees and disbursements and processing fees required to be paid to the
Existing Lenders as a condition to issuance of the Assumption Documents
(collectively, the " _Assumption Expenses_ "). If applicable, Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for any
reasonable out-of-pocket Assumption Expenses incurred by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation under this
_Section 5.16_.

 

Section 5.17 _Financing_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, prior to the Closing, the Company shall,
and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to, cause its and the Company Subsidiaries Representatives
to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested in writing by Parent in
connection with Parent arranging financing with respect to the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or the Company Real Properties effective as of or after
(and conditioned on the occurrence of) the Partnership Merger Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Financing_ "), including using commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) furnish such financial, statistical and other pertinent

and the Company Subsidiaries control and customarily prepared by or for the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, (ii)

Company Subsidiary shall be required to enter into any agreement related to
any Financing that is not effective as of or immediately prior to and
conditioned on the occurrence of the Partnership Merger Effective Time), (vi)
as may be reasonably requested by Parent, following the obtainment of the 

 



64  Company Requisite Vote, form new direct or indirect Company Subsidiaries
pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company,
(vii) as may be reasonably requested by Parent, following the obtainment of
the Company Requisite Vote and provided such actions would not adversely
affect the Tax status of the Company or Company Subsidiaries or cause the
Company to be subject to additional Taxes that are not indemnified by Parent
under the last sentence of this _Section 5.17(a)_, transfer or otherwise
restructure its ownership of existing Company Subsidiaries, properties or
other assets, in each case, pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory

to obtaining required third party consents with respect thereto (which the
Company shall use reasonable efforts to obtain), leased by the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries ( _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) neither
Parent nor its Representatives shall have the right to take and analyze any
samples of any environmental media (including soil, groundwater, surface
water, air or sediment) or any building material or to perform any invasive
testing procedure on any such property, (B) Parent shall schedule and
coordinate all inspections with the Company in accordance with _Section
5.2(a)_, and (C) the Company shall be entitled to have representatives
present at all times during any such inspection); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would
unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries or require the Company to agree to pay any fees,
reimburse any expenses, or give any indemnities prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time (except those fees and expenses that the Company is
reimbursed for by Parent). None of the representations, warranties or
covenants of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed to apply
to, or deemed breached or violated by, any of the actions taken by the Company
at the request of Parent set forth in this _Section 5.17(a)_. Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable legal fees and disbursements)
incurred by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in performing their
obligations under this _Section 5.17(a)_, and indemnify the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries for any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries arising therefrom
(and in the event the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not consummated, Parent shall promptly reimburse the

 



65  Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries not previously reimbursed).

 

(b) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Company obtained pursuant to _Section 5.17(a)_ by Parent or its
Representatives shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Company agrees that Parent and its
Representatives may initiate contact with and pursue potential debt financing
sources in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in
each case subject to the confidentiality and use restrictions applicable
to "Representatives" (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) set forth
in the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 5.18 _Senior Notes_.

 

(a) At the request of Parent, the Partnership shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to commence as promptly as practicable following the later
of (1) the tenth (10th) Business Day prior to the estimated date that the
definitive Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC and (2) the date of receipt
of the Offer Documents from Parent pursuant to _Section 5.18(c)_ below and
written instructions from Parent, offers to purchase and related consent
solicitations with respect to all of the outstanding securities issued
pursuant to (i) the 2.625% Senior Notes Indenture, (ii) the 3.85% Senior
Notes Indenture, (iii) the 4.25% Senior Notes Indenture and/or (iv) the 6.125%
Senior Notes Indenture (collectively, the " _Senior Notes_ ") on terms and
conditions as determined by Parent and as are reasonably acceptable to the
Company (such offers to purchase and related consent solicitations,
collectively, the " _Debt Offers_ "); _provided_ that (i) this Agreement shall
have not been terminated in accordance with _Article VII_ , (ii) the Company
shall have received from Parent the completed Offer Documents which shall be
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, and (iii) at the
time of such commencement, Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II shall have
otherwise performed or complied with all of their agreements and covenants
required by this Agreement to be performed on or prior to the time that the
Debt Offers are to be commenced. The Debt Offers and Offer Documents shall
comply in all respects with the terms and conditions of the indentures
governing the Senior Notes and applicable Laws (including the rules and
regulations of the SEC), and the Debt Offers shall be conditioned upon the
consummation of the Mergers. The Partnership shall waive any of the conditions
to the Debt Offers (other than that the Mergers shall have been consummated
and that there shall be no Law prohibiting consummation of the Debt Offers)
as may be reasonably requested by Parent in writing and shall not waive any
condition to the Debt Offers or make any changes to the Debt Offers other than
as agreed by Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Partnership shall not
be required to make any change to the terms and conditions of the Debt Offers
after commencement thereof that decreases the price or consent fee payable per
Senior Note or imposes any condition that is adverse to the holders of Senior
Notes unless agreed by the Company. At the request of Parent, the Partnership
shall terminate the Debt Offers as to any or all series of Senior Notes.

 

(b) The Company and the Partnership agree that, promptly following the
consent date specified in the Offer Documents (as it may reasonably be
extended at the request of Parent), assuming the requisite consents are
received, each of the Company and the

 



66  Partnership and any other Company Subsidiaries as may be necessary shall
execute supplemental indentures to the indentures governing the Senior Notes,
which supplemental indentures shall, subject to and conditioned upon the
consummation of the Mergers, implement the amendments described in the Offer
Documents and shall become operative upon acceptance of the Senior Notes for
payment pursuant to the Debt Offers concurrently with the Company Merger
Effective Time. Concurrently with the Company Merger Effective Time, the
Surviving Partnership at Parents direction shall accept for payment and,
after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Partnership to promptly pay for the Senior Notes that have been validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Offers and, subject to
receipt of the requisite consents, pay for consents validly delivered and not
validly revoked prior to the consent date in accordance with the Debt Offers.

(c) If Parent requests to cause the Partnership to commence the Debt
Offers, Parent, at its sole expense, shall prepare all necessary and
appropriate documentation in connection with the Debt Offers, including the
offers to purchase, related consents and letters of transmittal and other
related documents (collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent, the
Company and the Partnership shall, and shall cause the other Company
Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of
the Offer Documents. The Offer Documents (including all amendments or
supplements thereto) and all mailings to the holders of the Senior Notes in
connection with the Debt Offers shall be subject to the prior review of, and
comment by, the Company and Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable in form
and substance to each of them. If at any time prior to the completion of the
Debt Offers any information in the Offer Documents should be discovered by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other,
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer
Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party in writing,
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be prepared by Parent, at its sole expense, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, and disseminated by or on behalf of the
Partnership to the holders of the applicable Senior Notes. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _(b)_ , the Company and the Partnership shall
comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other applicable Law to the extent such Laws are applicable in connection
with the Debt Offers. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable Law
conflict with this _(b)_ , the Company and the Partnership shall comply with
the applicable Law and shall not be deemed to have breached their
obligations hereunder by such compliance.

(d) In connection with the Debt Offers, Parent may select one or more
dealer managers or solicitation agents, information agents, depositaries and
other agents (in each case as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company)
to provide assistance in connection therewith and the Company and
the Partnership shall, and shall cause the other Company Subsidiaries to,
enter into customary agreements (including indemnities) with such parties so
selected and on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to the Company and
Parent. Parent shall promptly pay all of the fees and expenses of each and
any dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent, depositary or other
agent retained in connection with the Debt Offers,

 



67  and Parent further agrees to reimburse the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for all of their reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including
reasonable fees and expenses of their Representatives) incurred in connection
with the Debt Offers promptly upon request by the Company. Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and
their respective Representatives (other than any direct indemnification of
any dealer manager or solicitation agent, which shall be indemnified under
the applicable dealer manager or solicitation agent agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall indemnify the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with any dealer manager or solicitation agent
agreement) from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries in connection with the
Debt Offers and the Offer Documents; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that Parent
shall not have any obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any such party or
person to the extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred
arises from disclosure regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
supplied by such party or person or included in any Company SEC Document that
is determined to have contained a material misstatement or omission.

 

(e) To the extent that, as of the Closing Date, (i) Parent has requested
that the Debt Offers be commenced and the requisite consents contemplated by
the consent solicitations included in the Debt Offers have not been validly
delivered (without having been properly withdrawn) in accordance with the Debt
Offers with respect to any series of Senior Notes by the holders thereof or
(ii) Parent has not requested that the Debt Offers be commenced, then, at the
written request of Parent, the Partnership shall reasonably cooperate with
Parent, including by adopting resolutions and providing officers
certificates and/or company instructions, in effecting, at the Partnership
Merger Effective Time, the giving of notices of optional redemption of the
applicable Senior Notes and the satisfaction and discharge of the 6.125%
Senior Notes Indenture, the 3.85% Senior Notes Indenture, the 4.25% Senior
Notes Indenture and/or the 2.625% Senior Notes Indenture or the covenant
defeasance of the applicable Senior Notes issued under the foregoing in each
case in accordance with and to the extent permitted by the terms and
conditions of the applicable indenture; _provided_ , that Parent shall have
provided written notice to the Company confirming that all conditions set
forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ have been satisfied (or with
respect to _Section 6.2_ waived) and that Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub
II are prepared to proceed immediately with the Closing; and _provided_
_further_ that, Parent shall concurrently and irrevocably deposit with the
applicable trustee under the applicable indenture at the Closing, as trust
funds in trust for the sole benefit of holders of the Senior Notes, cash in an
amount sufficient to effect such satisfaction and discharge or covenant
defeasance in accordance with the indentures governing the Senior Notes.

 

Section 5.19 _Transfer Rights_. The Company shall not, and shall not
permit any Company Subsidiary to, exercise, or authorize the exercise of, any
Transfer Rights. In the event a notice exercising a Transfer Right is received
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary from a Third Party (a "
_Transfer Right Notice_ "), the Company shall provide Parent with prompt
written notice of such exercise, together with the Transfer Right Notice and
all underlying documentation received by the Company or the applicable Company
Subsidiary relating to same.

 



68  The Company shall, and shall cause the applicable Company Subsidiary to,
respond to the Transfer Right Notice in accordance with the reasonable
directions of Parent, to the extent such directions are consented to by the
Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and shall
take all reasonable actions in connection therewith as Parent shall reasonably
request, to the extent such actions are consented to by the Company (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, whether or not the
Mergers are consummated, all expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such expenses.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated

 

(i) by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_,

 

(ii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(i),_ or

 

(iii) (A) by the Company or Parent pursuant to  _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ or
_Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ and
(B)(x) a Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been received by the Company
or its Representatives or any Person shall have publicly proposed or publicly
announced an intention (whether or

 



73  not conditional) to make a Company Acquisition Proposal (and, in the case of
a termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_, such Company Acquisition
Proposal or publicly proposed or announced intention shall have been made
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting) and (y) within twelve (12) months
after a termination referred to in this _Section 7.3(b)(iii)_ the Company
enters into a definitive agreement relating to, or consummates, any Company
Acquisition Proposal (with, for purposes of this clause (y), the references to
"15%" in the definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" being deemed to be
references to "50%"),

then the Company shall pay as directed by Parent an amount equal to one
hundred sixty million dollars ($160,000,000) (the " _Company Termination Fee_
") by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent, (1)
in the case of a payment as a result of any event referred to in _Section
7.3(b)(i)_, within two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination
by Parent, (2) in the case of a payment as a result of any event referred to

the Company and (3) in the case of a payment as a result of any event
referred to in _Section 7.3(b)(iii)_, within two (2) Business Days after the
earlier of entering into a definitive agreement relating to the Company
Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (y) of _Section 7.3(b)(iii)_ and
consummation of such Company Acquisition Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt,
in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee
on more than one occasion.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_, then Parent
shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company an amount equal to the Parent
Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by
the Company promptly but in no event later than three (3) Business Days after
such termination. " _Parent Termination Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to
four hundred sixty million dollars ($460,000,000).

 

(d) The Company and Parent agree that the agreements contained in this 
_Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent, Merger
Sub I and Merger Sub II in the circumstances in which the Company Termination
Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Mergers, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. If Parent receives the
full payment of the Company Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.3(b)_ under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee was
payable, the receipt by Parent of the Company Termination Fee shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy for any and all losses or damages suffered by
Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or any of their respective affiliates or
Representatives in connection with this Agreement (and the termination
hereof), the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination. In
the event that Parent or the Company, as the case may be, is required to
commence litigation to seek all or a portion of the amounts payable under this
_Section 7.3_, and it prevails in such litigation, it shall be entitled to
receive, in addition to all

 



74  amounts that it is otherwise entitled to receive under this _Section 7.3_,
all reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees) which it has incurred in
enforcing its rights hereunder.

Section 7.4 _Payment of Amount or Expense_.

 

(a) In the event that Parent is obligated to pay the Parent Termination
Fee pursuant to  _Section 7.3(c)_ (the " _Section 7.3 Amount_ "), Parent
shall pay to the Company from the applicable Section 7.3 Amount deposited into
escrow, if any, in accordance with the next sentence, an amount equal to the
lesser of (A) the Section 7.3 Amount and (B) the sum of (1) the maximum
amount that can be paid to the Company without causing the Company to fail to
meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as
if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections
856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), as determined by
the Companys independent certified public accountants, plus (2) in the event
the Company receives either (X) a letter from the Companys counsel indicating
that the Company has received a ruling from the IRS described in _Section
7.4(b)(ii)_ or (Y) an opinion from the Companys outside counsel as described
in _Section 7.4(b)(ii)_, an amount equal to the Section 7.3 Amount less the
amount payable under clause (1) above. To secure Parents obligation to pay
these amounts, Parent shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to
the Section 7.3 Amount with an escrow agent selected by the Company and on
such terms (subject to _Section 7.4(b)_) as shall be mutually agreed upon by
the Company, Parent and the escrow agent as reflected in an escrow agreement
among such parties, provided that the payment or deposit into escrow shall be
at the Companys option. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Section 7.3
Amount pursuant to this _Section 7.4(a)_ shall be made at the time Parent is
obligated to pay the Company such amount pursuant to _Section 7.3(c)_ by wire
transfer of same day funds.

 

(b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Section 7.3 Amount in
escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Company unless the
escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter
from the Companys independent certified public accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Company without
causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and
(3) of the Code in such year determined as if the payment of such amount did
not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from the Companys
accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release
such amount to the Company, or (ii) a letter from the Companys counsel
indicating that the Company received a ruling from the IRS holding that the
receipt by the Company of the Section 7.3 Amount would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or alternatively, the Companys
outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by
the Company of the Section 7.3 Amount would either constitute Qualifying
Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code), in which case the escrow agent shall release
the remainder of the Section 7.3 Amount to the Company. Parent agrees to amend
this _Section 7.4_ at the reasonable request of the Company in order to (x)
maximize the portion of the Section 7.3 Amount that may be distributed to the
Company hereunder without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements
of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve the Companys chances
of securing a favorable ruling described in this _Section 7.4(b)_ or (z)
assist

 



75  the Company in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel
as described in this _Section 7.4(b)_. Parent shall be deemed to have
satisfied its obligations pursuant to this _Section 7.4_ so long as it
deposits into escrow the Section 7.3 Amount, notwithstanding any delay or
reduction in payment to the Company, and shall have no further liability with
respect to payment of the Section 7.3 Amount. The portion of Section 7.3
Amount that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as
soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing
limitations of this _Section 7.3_. The Company shall fully indemnify Parent
and hold Parent harmless from and against any liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by it resulting directly or indirectly from the escrow agreement.

Section 8.4 _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance
of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Maryland (other
than with respect to issues relating to the Company Merger that are required
to be governed by the DRULPA), in each case without regard to its rules of
conflict of laws.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby (i) irrevocably submits to and
agrees to be subject to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State
of Maryland and/or the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, for
the purpose of any claim, action, suit or proceeding (whether based in
contract, tort or otherwise), directly or indirectly, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the actions of the parties hereto in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, (ii)
irrevocably agrees that all such claims, actions, suits or proceedings may
and shall be brought before, and determined by, only a state or federal court
sitting in or for the State of Maryland with subject matter jurisdiction over
such claim(s), action(s), suit(s) or proceeding(s), (iii) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, and (iv) agrees that it will not
(except for a suit on the judgment as expressly permitted by _Section
8.4(d)_) bring any claim, action, suit or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court
other than the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland or a Maryland
state court.

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the service of the
summons and complaint and any other process in any other claim, suit, action
or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on
behalf of itself or its property, in the manner provided by _Section 8.3_ and
nothing in this  _Section 8.4_ shall affect the right of any party hereto to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

(d) Each party hereto agrees that a final judgment in any claim, suit,
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 

(e) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE), DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING OUT OF

 



78  OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR
THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH SUCH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III)
EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.4(E).

 

Section 8.5 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. The parties
hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article,
Section, exhibit or schedule, such reference shall be to an Article or
Section of, or an exhibit or schedule to, this Agreement, unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings for this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used
in any certificate or other instrument made or delivered pursuant hereto
unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement
are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and
to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term.
Any Law defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that
is referred to herein means such Law as from time to time amended, modified
or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession of
comparable successor Laws. References to a Person are also to its successors
and permitted assigns. All references to "dollars" or "$" refer to currency
of the United States of America.

 

Section 8.6 _Parties In Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its successors
and permitted assigns, and, except as provided in _Section 5.9_, nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon
any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further
agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under _Section 5.9_ shall
not arise unless and until the Company Merger Effective Time occurs. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties may be
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with

 



79   _Section 8.10_ without notice or liability to any other Person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 

Section 8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 8.8 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm, for which monetary
damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the Company or the Partnership do not perform any of the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of them hereunder to consummate the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with the
Agreements specified terms or otherwise breaches such provisions.
Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that Parent, Merger Sub I and
Merger Sub II shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief to prevent and/or remedy a breach of this Agreement by
the Company and the Partnership and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which Parent, Merger
Sub I or Merger Sub II are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the Company
and the Partnership agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief on the basis that
any of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II has an adequate remedy at Law or
that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at Law or in equity. Any of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent a breach or breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with the request for or grant of any such order or injunction.
Each of the Company and the Partnership agree not to assert that a remedy of
specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable
for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide
an adequate remedy. The parties hereto agree that neither the Company nor the
Partnership shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent and/or remedy a breach of this Agreement by
Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II or to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof and that the Companys and the Partnerships sole and
exclusive remedy relating to a breach of this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub
I or Merger Sub II or otherwise shall be the remedy set forth in _Section
7.3(c)_;

 



80   _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be entitled to seek
specific performance to prevent any breach by Parent of _Section 5.2(b)_.

 

(b) The parties further agree (i) the seeking of remedies pursuant to 
_Section 8.8(a)_ shall not in any respect constitute a waiver by any of
Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II seeking such remedies of its respective
right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to it under this
Agreement, including under _Section 7.3_, in the event that this Agreement
has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in _Section
8.8(a)_ are not available or otherwise not granted and (ii) nothing set forth
in this Agreement shall require Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II to
institute any proceeding for (or limit any of Parents, Merger Sub Is or
Merger Sub IIs right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance
under this  _Section 8.8_ prior or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under _Article VII_ (and pursuing damages after such
termination), nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding by any of
Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II seeking remedies pursuant to _Section
8.8(a)_ or anything set forth in this _Section 8.8_ restrict or limit
Parents right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
_Article VII_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be
available then or thereafter.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
maximum aggregate liability of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II
together for any losses, damages, costs or expenses of the Company or the
Partnership or their affiliates relating to the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, or a breach of this
Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II or otherwise, shall be
limited to an amount equal to (i) the amount of the Parent Termination Fee,
plus (ii) the aggregate amount of Assumption Expenses payable or reimbursable
pursuant to _Section 5.16(b)_, plus (iii) Parents indemnification, payment
and reimbursement obligations pursuant to the last sentence of _Section
5.15_, the last sentence of  _Section 5.17(a)_ and _Section 5.18(d)_
(collectively, the " _Liability Limitation_ "), and in no event shall the
Company or the Partnership or any of their affiliates seek any amount in
excess of the Liability Limitation in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any other document or theory
of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to
be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in equity, in
contract, tort or otherwise. Each of the Company and the Partnership agrees
that it has no right of recovery against, and no personal liability shall
attach to, any of the Parent Parties (other than Parent, Merger Sub I or
Merger Sub II to the extent provided in this Agreement and Blackstone Real
Estate Advisors L.P. to the extent provided in the Confidentiality Agreement),
through Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II or otherwise, whether by
or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or
limited liability company veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of
Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II against any Parent Party, by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any applicable Law, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, except
for its rights to recover from the Guarantor (but not any other Parent Party)
under and to the extent provided in the Guaranty and subject to the Liability
Limitation and the other limitations described therein. Recourse against the
Guarantor under the Guaranty shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Company, the Partnership and their respective affiliates against
the Guarantor and any other Parent Party (other than Parent, Merger Sub I or
Merger Sub II to the extent provided in this Agreement and Blackstone Real
Estate Advisors

 



81  L.P. to the extent provided in the Confidentiality Agreement) in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of
any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
Without limiting the rights of the Company against Parent, Merger Sub I or
Merger Sub II hereunder and Blackstone Real Estate Advisors L.P. under the
Confidentiality Agreement, in no event shall the Company or its affiliates
seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this
Agreement against, or seek to recover damages from, any Parent Party (other
than the Guarantor to the extent provided in the Guaranty and subject to the
Liability Limitation and the other limitations described therein).

 

Section 8.9 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by action
taken by the Company, the Partnership, Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II
at any time before or after approval of the Mergers by the Company Requisite
Vote but, after such approval, no amendment shall be made which requires the
approval of any such stockholders under applicable Law without obtaining such
further approvals. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of the parties hereto.

 

Section 8.10 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing
Date, each party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (ii) waive any breaches or
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
parties contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered
pursuant hereto, or (iii) subject to _Section 8.9_, waive compliance by the
other parties with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of any party hereto to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by the Company, the Partnership, Parent, Merger Sub I or
Merger Sub II in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise of any other right hereunder.

 

Section 8.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall be considered one and the same
agreement. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by facsimile or by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be
sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

FORM OF

ARTICLE 17 

SERIES B CUMULATIVE PREFERRED UNITS

 

Section 17.1. _Designation and Number_

 

A series of units of Partnership Interests in the Partnership designated as
the "5.5% Series B Cumulative Preferred Units" (the " _Series B Preferred
Units_ ") is hereby established. The number of Series B Preferred Units shall
be [●]. The Series B Preferred Units shall be uncertificated.

 

Section 17.2. _Distributions_

 

A. Holders of Series B Preferred Units shall be entitled to
receive, when, as and if authorized by the General Partner in its sole
discretion, out of Available Cash, cumulative preferential cash distributions
in an amount equal to 5.5% per annum on the _[$23.75_ \+ _amount
of Additional Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement]_ liquidation
preference of each Series B Preferred Unit (the " _Distribution Rate_ "). Such
distributions shall accrue and be cumulative from the Closing Date (as defined
in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 7, 2015, by and
among the Partnership and the other parties thereto (as amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_
")) and shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last calendar day (or,
if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding day that is a Business
Day) of each March, June, September and December of each year (each a "
_Distribution Payment Date_ "), commencing on the first such date after the
Closing Date. The period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding
the first Distribution Payment Date, and each subsequent period from and
including a Distribution Payment Date to but excluding the next succeeding
Distribution Payment Date, is hereinafter called a " _Distribution Period._ "
Distributions shall be payable to holders of Series B Preferred Units of
record as they appear in the transfer books of the Partnership at the close
of business on the applicable record date (each, a " _Record Date_ "), which
shall be the 15th day of the calendar month in which the applicable
Distribution Payment Date falls or such other date designated by the General
Partner for the payment of distributions that is not more than thirty (30) nor
less than ten (10) days prior to such Distribution Payment Date. The amount of
any distribution payable for any Distribution Period, or portion thereof,
shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day
months.

 

B. Distributions on the Series B Preferred Units which are due
but unpaid will accumulate quarterly, whether or not there is sufficient
Available Cash for such distributions, whether or not the Partnership has
earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of
such distributions and whether or not such distributions are authorized.
Accrued but unpaid distributions on the Series B Preferred Units will
accumulate as of the Distribution Payment Date on which they first become
payable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Partnership shall make quarterly distributions of cash (the " _Tax Liability
Distributions_ ") to the holders of Series B Preferred Units, as distributions
on the Series B Preferred Units, in an amount sufficient to enable such
holders to pay, on a quarterly basis, U.S. federal, state and local income
taxes arising from the allocations made (or estimated to be made) to such
holders pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent that
distributions otherwise paid to the holders of Series B Preferred Units in
such quarter and prior quarters in such fiscal year are not sufficient for
such holders to pay such taxes, which payments shall be made within thirty
(30) days after the close of each applicable quarter. Subject to the
following sentence, the amount of any such Tax Liability Distribution shall
equal the product of (x) the highest marginal combined U.S. federal, state and
local income tax rate applicable to an individual holder of Series B
Preferred Units residing in California (after giving effect to income tax
deductions (if allowable) for state and local income taxes and the character
of the applicable income) for such fiscal period and (y) the
aggregate amounts of net taxable income or gain of the Partnership that were
actually allocated or are estimated to be allocated to such holder for federal
income tax purposes for such fiscal period and any prior fiscal period (only
to the extent no Tax Liability Distribution or other distribution was
previously made with respect to such fiscal period). For the  avoidance of doubt, any Tax Liability Distributions shall reduce the amount
of any accrued but unpaid distributions with respect to the Series B Preferred
Units.

 

C. If any Series B Preferred Units are outstanding, if and so
long as the Partnership is in arrears with regard to the payment of any
distributions upon the Series B Preferred Units in respect of any completed
Distribution Period, (i) no distributions (other than distributions made in
Series B Junior Units (as defined below) or options, warrants or rights to
subscribe for or purchase Series B Junior Units) shall be authorized or paid
or set apart for payment nor shall any other distribution be authorized or
made upon any Series B Junior Units unless distributions sufficient to make
up such arrearage shall have been or contemporaneously are authorized and paid
or authorized and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for
payment for all past Distribution Periods, and (ii) no Series B Junior Units
shall be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or
any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption
of any such Partnership Interests) by the Partnership (except by conversion
into or exchange for Series B Junior Units or options, warrants or rights to
subscribe for or purchase Series B Junior Units).

 

D. If any Series B Preferred Units are outstanding, if and so
long as distributions are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full
payment is not so set apart) upon the Series B Preferred Units and all other
Partnership Interests ranking on parity with the Series B Preferred Units as
to dividends and other distributions, all distributions authorized upon the
Series B Preferred Units shall be authorized and paid pro rata so that the
amount of distributions authorized and paid per Series B Preferred Unit and
any such other Partnership Interest shall in all cases bear to each other the
same ratio that accumulated distributions per Series B Preferred Unit and any
such other Partnership Interest bear to each other. No interest shall be
payable in respect of any distribution payment or payments on Series B
Preferred Units which may be in arrears.

 

E. No distributions on the Series B Preferred Units other than
Tax Liability Distributions shall be authorized by the General Partner or paid
or set apart for payment by the Partnership at such times as any agreement of
the Partnership, including any agreement relating to its indebtedness,
prohibits such authorization, payment or setting apart for payment or
provides that such authorization, payment or setting apart for payment would
constitute a breach thereof or a default thereunder, or if such authorization
or payment shall be restricted or prohibited by law. The Partnership shall
not enter into any agreement that prohibits the authorization, payment or
setting apart for payment of any Tax Liability Distributions or provides that
any such action would constitute a breach thereof or default thereunder.

F. Holders of Series B Preferred Units shall not be entitled to
any distribution, whether payable in cash, property or Partnership Interests
in excess of full cumulative distributions on the Series B Preferred Units as
described above. Any distribution authorized on the Series B Preferred Units
shall first be credited against the earliest accumulated but unpaid
distribution due with respect to such Series B Preferred Units which remains
payable.

 

G. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, so long as
(i) the Partnership is not in arrears with regard to the payment of any
distributions upon the Series B Preferred Units in respect of any completed
Distribution Period and (ii) the Partnership shall have made all
redemption payments then due to be paid to holders of the Series B Preferred
Units under Section 17.4 hereof, the Partnership shall be permitted at any
time to make cash distributions and distributions in-kind of assets,
properties or securities to holders of Partnership Interests other than
Series B Preferred Units, and the holders of Series B Preferred Units shall
not be entitled to participate in any such distributions.

 

Section 17.3. _Liquidation Preference_

 

A. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the affairs of the Partnership, before any distribution or
payment shall be made to holders of Series B Junior Units, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including Section 13.2 hereof,
each holder of Series B Preferred Units shall be entitled to receive and be
paid out of the assets of the Partnership legally available for distribution
to the Partners pursuant to this Agreement a liquidation preference per Series
B 

 



2  Preferred Unit equal to _[$23.75_ \+ _amount of Additional Consideration
pursuant to the Merger Agreement]_ , plus an amount equal to any accrued and
unpaid distributions to but excluding the date of payment on the Series B
Preferred Units held by such holder.

 

B. In the event that, upon any such voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the legally available assets of the
Partnership are insufficient to pay the full amount of the liquidating
distributions on all outstanding Series B Preferred Units, then such assets
shall be allocated among the holders of Series B Preferred Units in
proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise
respectively be entitled, pursuant to Section 17.3.A.

 

C. After payment of the full amount of the
liquidating distributions to which they are entitled pursuant to Section
17.3.A, the holders of Series B Preferred Units, as such, will have no right
or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Partnership, shall cease to be
Partners in respect of such Series B Preferred Units and the Series B
Preferred Units shall be deemed cancelled.

 

D. The consolidation or merger of the Partnership with or into
any other partnership, corporation, trust or entity or of any other
partnership, corporation, trust or other entity with or into the Partnership
or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of, the property
or business of the Partnership, shall not be deemed to constitute a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership for purposes of this
Section 17.3.

 

Section 17.4. _Redemption at Holder s Option for Cash_

 

A. Commencing on the earlier of (i) the date the amount of "Total
Capital" as reflected in the Partnerships unaudited consolidated balance
sheets for a calendar quarter is less than $100 million (a " _Total Capital
Shortfall Event_ ") and (ii) December 31, 2016 (or at any earlier time that
the Partnership is a Subsidiary of a Person that is subject to taxation as a
REIT with Publicly Traded common stock, or upon the earlier death of a holder
of Series B Preferred Units, solely in respect of such holders estate), each
holder of Series B Preferred Units (or such deceased holders estate only, as
applicable) shall have the right (the " _Preferred Redemption Right_ ") to
require the Partnership to redeem on the Preferred Redemption Date (as
defined below) all or any portion of the Series B Preferred Units held by such
holder at a redemption price per Series B Preferred Unit, payable in cash,
equal to _[$23.75_ \+ _amount of Additional Consideration pursuant to the
Merger Agreement]_ plus an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid
distributions to but excluding the Preferred Redemption Date (the "
_Redemption Price_ ") to be paid by the Partnership. The Preferred Redemption
Right shall be exercised pursuant to a Notice of Redemption (as defined
below) delivered to the General Partner by the holder of Series B Preferred
Units who is exercising the redemption right. Except in the event of a Total
Capital Shortfall Event or in the event of the death of a holder of Series B
Preferred Units (in which event the Preferred Redemption Right shall be
exercisable solely by such holders estate), the Preferred Redemption Right
shall only be available, and a Notice of Redemption in respect thereof may
only be delivered, once per quarter during the first month of each fiscal
quarter of the Partnership commencing January 2017. For purposes of this
Article 17, (i) " _Preferred Redemption Date_ " means the second to last
Business Day of the fiscal quarter of the Partnership in which the General
Partner receives the applicable Notice of Redemption pursuant to this Section
17.4 or, if the second to last Business Day of such fiscal quarter is less
than ten (10) Business Days from the date on which the General Partner
receives the applicable Notice of Redemption pursuant to Section 17.4, then
the second to last Business Day of the next subsequent fiscal quarter of the
Partnership and (ii) " _Publicly Traded_ " means listed or admitted to
trading on New York Stock Exchange LLC, NYSE MKT LLC, The Nasdaq Stock Market
LLC or another national securities exchange, or any successor to the
foregoing.

 

B. In the event any applicable redemption date shall not be a
Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price need not be made on such
redemption date but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the
same force and effect as if made on such applicable redemption date and no
interest, additional distributions or other sum shall accrue on the amount
payable for the period from and after such redemption date to such next
succeeding Business Day.

 



3 C. On and after the Preferred Redemption Date, all distributions
on the Series B Preferred Units designated for redemption in the Notice of
Redemption shall cease to accrue and all rights of the holder thereof, except
the right to receive the Redemption Price, shall cease and terminate, such
Series B Preferred Units shall not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose
whatsoever, and such holder shall cease to be a Limited Partner in respect of
such Series B Preferred Units.

 

D. At its election, the Partnership, prior to a Preferred
Redemption Date, may irrevocably deposit the Redemption Price of the Series B
Preferred Units so called for redemption in trust for the holder thereof with
a bank or trust company, in which case (i) the Partnership shall notify
the applicable holder of such Series B Preferred Units in writing that the
Redemption Price has been so deposited, (ii) on and after the applicable
Preferred Redemption Date, all distributions on the Series B Preferred Units
designated for redemption in the Notice of Redemption shall cease to accrue
and (iii) on and after the date of such Notice of Redemption and the date such
funds have been set aside, all rights of the holders of such Series B
Preferred Units except the right to receive the Redemption Price, shall cease
and terminate, such Series B Preferred Units shall not be deemed to be
outstanding for any purpose whatsoever, and such holder shall cease to be a
Limited Partner in respect of such Series B Preferred Units.

E. In the event the General Partner (or its direct or indirect
parent) is (as the result of any merger, acquisition or otherwise) a REIT with
Publicly Traded equity securities, the General Partner shall have the right,
without the consent of any Partner or other Person, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, to amend this Section 17.4 and any provision of
this Agreement as necessary to provide the REIT the option, in lieu of paying
the Redemption Price in cash, to issue an amount of Publicly Traded stock
in such public REIT with a fair market value at the time of redemption, as
determined by the General Partner in good faith, equal to the Redemption Price
to any redeeming holders of Series B Preferred Units who consent to such
substitution with respect to such particular redemption; _provided_ that this
right of substitution shall be available only if the shares of stock to be
issued to such holder of Series B Preferred Units pursuant hereto are
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission for immediate resale
by the redeeming holder of Series B Preferred Units.

 

F. For purposes of this Article 17, " _Notice of Redemption_ "
means a notice substantially in the following form:

"The undersigned hereby irrevocably (i) elects to redeem all of the
undersigneds Series B Preferred Units in BioMed Realty, L.P. in accordance
with the terms of Article 17 of the Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of
Limited Partnership of BioMed Realty, L.P., as may be further
amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, and,
the redemption right referred to in Section 17.4 thereof, (ii) surrenders such
Series B Preferred Units and all right, title and interest therein, for
redemption pursuant to such provisions, and (iii) directs that the Redemption
Price deliverable upon exercise of such redemption right pursuant to Section
17.4 thereof be delivered to the undersigned at the address specified below.

4 Section 17.5. _Redemption at Partnership s Option_

 

A. Commencing on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Partnership shall have the right, in its sole discretion and from time to time
(the " _Partnership Redemption Right_ "), to redeem all or any portion of the
Series B Preferred Units then outstanding ( _provided_ , that the Partnership
Redemption Right shall not be exercised for less than all of the Series B
Preferred Units if, after the exercise of such Partnership Redemption Right,
Series B Preferred Units with less than $5 million in aggregate liquidation
preference would remain outstanding), for a cash redemption price per Series
B Preferred Unit equal to the Redemption Price. The Partnership shall exercise
the Partnership Redemption Right by providing each record holder of Series B
Preferred Units not less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days
prior written notice of the applicable date of redemption. Such notice shall
include (i) the number of Series B Preferred Units to be redeemed from each
such holder, (ii) the applicable Redemption Price, (iii) the applicable date
of redemption and (iv) that distributions on the Series B Preferred Units to
be redeemed shall cease to accrue on and after such redemption date. No
failure to give or defect in such notice or defect in the mailing thereof
shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Series
B Preferred Units except as to any holder of Series B Preferred Units to whom
notice was defective or not given. 

B. If the Partnership redeems less than all of the outstanding
Series B Preferred Units pursuant to any exercise of the Partnership
Redemption Right under this Section 17.5, the Series B Preferred Units to be
redeemed may be determined by the General Partner pro rata from the record
holders of Series B Preferred Units (with any appropriate adjustments in the
General Partners sole discretion to avoid redemption of fractions of
Partnership Interests), or by any other equitable manner determined by the
General Partner in its reasonable discretion.

C. In the event any applicable redemption date shall not be a
Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price need not be made on such
redemption date but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the
same force and effect as if made on such applicable redemption date and no
interest, additional distributions or other sum shall accrue on the amount
payable for the period from and after such redemption date to such next
succeeding Business Day.

 

D. On and after the redemption date (unless the Partnership
defaults in payment of the Redemption Price), all distributions on the Series
B Preferred Units designated for redemption in the notice of redemption shall
cease to accrue and all rights of the holder thereof, except the right to
receive the Redemption Price, shall cease and terminate, such Series B
Preferred Units shall not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose
whatsoever, and such holder shall cease to be a Limited Partner in respect of
such Series B Preferred Units.

 

E. At its election, the Partnership, prior to the redemption
date, may irrevocably deposit the Redemption Price of the Series B Preferred
Units so called for redemption in trust for the holder thereof with a bank or
trust company, in which case (i) the Partnership shall notify the
applicable holder of such Series B Preferred Units in writing that the
Redemption Price has been so deposited, (ii) on and after the applicable
redemption date, all distributions on the Series B Preferred Units designated
for redemption in the notice of redemption shall cease to accrue and (iii) on
and after the date of such notice of redemption and the date such funds have
been set aside, all rights of the holder thereof, except the right to receive
the Redemption Price, shall cease and terminate, such Series B Preferred
Units shall not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever, and
such holder shall cease to be a Limited Partner in respect of such Series B
Preferred Units.

 

Section 17.6. _Ranking_

 

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, including any amendments made
hereto after the Closing Date, the Series B Preferred Units shall, with
respect to distribution rights and rights upon voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership, rank senior to all
other series or classes of Partnership Interests (all of which are referred
to collectively as " _Series B Junior Units_ ").

 



5 Section 17.7. _Voting Rights_

 

A. The holders of Series B Preferred Units shall have no voting
rights whatsoever on any matter relating to the Partnership, whether under
this Agreement, the Act, at law, in equity or otherwise, except as expressly
set forth in this Section 17.7.

 

B. So long as Series B Preferred Units with at least $5 million
in aggregate liquidation preference remain outstanding, the affirmative vote
or consent of the holders of at least a majority of the Series B Preferred
Units, outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, at a meeting
(voting as a separate class) or in writing (without prior notice and without
a vote) will be required to amend, alter or repeal the provisions of this
Article 17 or the Applicable Provisions, whether by merger or consolidation or
otherwise (an " _Event_ "), so as to permit the Partnership to either (i)
authorize, create or issue any class or series of Partnership Interests
ranking senior to or on a parity with the Series B Preferred Interests with
respect to rights to the payment of distributions and the distribution of
assets upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Partnership (" _Senior/Parity Units_ "), (ii) reclassify any authorized
Partnership Interests into Senior/Parity Units, (iii) authorize, create or
issue any obligation or security convertible into or exchangeable for or
evidencing the right to purchase any Senior/Parity Units or (iv) materially
and adversely affect any other right, preference, privilege or voting power
of the Series B Preferred Units or the holders thereof with respect to this
Article 17 or the Applicable Provisions; _provided_ _however_ , that so long
as (a) the Series B Preferred Units remain outstanding with the terms thereof
materially unchanged (taking into account that the Partnership may not be the
surviving entity), or (b) the holders of the Series B Preferred Units receive
equity securities of the surviving entity (taking into account that the
surviving entity may not be a partnership or formed in Maryland), with rights,
preferences, privileges and voting powers substantially the same as those of
the Series B Units, the occurrence of such Event shall not be deemed for
purposes of clause (iv) to materially and adversely affect such rights,
preferences, privileges or voting power of holders of Series B Preferred
Units, and in such case such holders shall not have any voting rights with
respect to the occurrence of such Event so long as no such vote would be
required under any of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii). Holders of Series B
Preferred Units shall not be entitled to vote with respect to (1) any
amendment, supplement or modification of any term or provision of this
Agreement, other than as expressly provided in the immediately preceding
sentence, or (2) the creation or issuance of any Series B Junior Units. Except
as set forth herein, holders of Series B Preferred Units, whether in their
capacities as Partners or otherwise, shall not have any voting rights
whatsoever, including any voting right that may otherwise arise under this
Agreement, the Act, at law, in equity or otherwise, and the consent of the
holders shall not be required for any action, including the taking of any
partnership action, including an Event, regardless of the effect that such
partnership action or Event may have upon the powers, preferences, voting
power or other rights or privileges of the Series B Preferred Units. For
purposes of this Article 17, " _Applicable Provisions_ " means the following
provisions of this Agreement: Section 2.4 (Power of Attorney), Section 4.1
(Capital Contribution of the Partners), Section 8.1 (Limitation of
Liability), Section 8.2 (Management of Business), Section 8.3 (Outside
Activities of Limited Partners), Section 9.1 (Records and Accounting), Section
9.3 (Reports), Article 10 (Tax Matters), Section 11.1 (Transfer), Section
11.3 (Limited Partners Right to Transfer)(other than the proviso to the first
sentence of Section 11.3A), Section 11.4 (Substituted Limited Partners) and
Article 12 (Admission of Partners) and, in each case, the definitions
relating thereto.

 

C. The foregoing voting provisions of this Section 17.7 shall not
apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote
would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding Series B
Preferred Units shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper
notice pursuant to Section 17.4 or Section 17.5 and sufficient funds, in cash
or securities, as applicable, shall have been deposited in trust for the
holders thereof with a bank or trust company to effect such redemption
in accordance with Section 17.4.D or Section 17.5.E.

 

D. In any matter in which the holders of Series B Preferred Units
may vote or act by written consent (as expressly provided herein), each Series
B Preferred Unit shall be entitled to one vote.

 



6 Section 17.8. _Transfer Restrictions_

 

The Series B Preferred Units are subject to the restrictions on "transfer"
contained in _Article 11_.

 

Section 17.9. _No Conversion Right_

 

The Series B Preferred Units shall not be convertible into any other class or
series of interest in the Partnership or capital stock of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

Section 17.10. _No Sinking Fund_

 

No sinking fund shall be established for the retirement or redemption of
Series B Preferred Units.

 

Section 17.11. _Allocations_

 

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law (i) each holder of Series B
Preferred Units shall be deemed to have a Capital Account as of the Closing
Date equal to the product of _[$23.75_ \+ _amount of Additional Consideration
pursuant to the Merger Agreement]_ multiplied by the number of Series
B Preferred Units held by such holder; (ii) the Partnerships Net Income
shall first be allocated to the holders of the Series B Preferred Units during
each Partnership Year until the aggregate amount of Net Income allocated to
each of the holders of Series B Preferred Units is equal to the sum of all
distributions paid to such holder pursuant to Section 17.2 from the Closing
Date to the date of such allocation plus any Net Losses allocated to such
holder pursuant to this Section 17.11 from the Closing Date to the date of
such allocation; (iii) all remaining Net Income of the Partnership shall be
allocated to the holders of Partnership Interests other than the Series B
Preferred Units; (iv) all Net Losses of the Partnership shall be allocated to
the holders of the Partnership Interests other than the Series B Preferred
Units until the Adjusted Capital Account Balance of each such holder of such
Partnership Interests has been reduced to zero; (v) Net Losses of the
Partnership next shall be allocated to the holders of Series B Preferred Units
until the Adjusted Capital Account Balance of each such holder of such Series
B Preferred Units has been reduced to zero; and (vi) any remaining Net Losses
of the Partnership shall be allocated to the General Partner. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if a holder of Series B Preferred Units receives a distribution
pursuant to Section 17.2 and after such distribution and allocations of Net
Income pursuant to this Section 17.11 for the then-current fiscal year, the
Adjusted Capital Account Balance of such holder in the then-current fiscal
period would be less than the amounts such holder would be entitled
to receive upon a liquidation of the Partnership, items of gross income and
gain will be allocated to match the distribution to the extent that the
cumulative Net Income allocated pursuant to this Section 17.11 for the then-
current and prior fiscal periods and gross income and gain allocated pursuant
to this Section 17.11 for prior fiscal periods (both reduced by any Net Loss
allocated under this Section 17.11 that has offset such allocations) are less
than cumulative distributions made under Section 17.2 for the then-current
and prior fiscal periods. Allocations to Partners in accordance with Article 6
of this Agreement shall take into account allocations required to be made
