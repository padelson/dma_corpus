Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



   1. | _Submission of Offer_. Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation
(" _Buyer_ ") is pleased to submit this final, binding and irrevocable offer
(this " _Offer_ ") to DePuy Synthes, Inc. (" _Seller_ ") for the acquisition
of the Transferred Assets, and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, of
the Business (in each case, as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement
referred to below) (the " _Acquisition_ "), on the terms and subject only to
the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement attached to this
Offer as _Exhibit 1_ and duly executed and delivered by Buyer (including the
Schedules and Exhibits thereto, the " _Asset Purchase Agreement_ "). Buyer
hereby confirms that if the Principal Closing Date occurred on the date
hereof, the conditions set forth in Section 5.02(a) of the Asset Purchase
Agreement would be satisfied and that Buyer will not take any action prior to
the earlier of (x) the Offer Acceptance (as defined below) and (y) the Offer
Termination Time (as defined below) which would cause such condition to not be
satisfied. Buyer hereby further agrees that it will comply with, and will
cause its Affiliates that are or will be parties to any Transaction Document
to comply with, the covenants set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement during
the period from the date of this Offer to the Offer Termination Time (or, if
this Offer is accepted by Seller in the manner contemplated herein, to the
time as set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement). Capitalized terms used in
this Offer shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Asset Purchase
Agreement unless otherwise defined herein. 
---|---

11:59 P.M., New York time, on the earlier of (a) the second business day after
the date on which each of the Specified Consultation Processes (as defined
below) have concluded, or are deemed having concluded according to applicable
Law, and (b) May 15, 2017; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Specified
Consultation Processes have not concluded, or deemed having
concluded according to applicable Law, by such date and Buyer or Seller, as
the case may be, shall have complied in all material respects with its
obligations with respect to Specified Consultation Process pursuant to
paragraph 7 below, then Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall be
permitted to extend this date from time to time in consecutive increments of
up to 30 days each, but in any event not beyond 11:59 P.M., New York time, on
August 14, 2017 (this time, as such time may be so extended by Buyer or
Seller, the " _Offer Termination Time_ "). The party extending the Offer
Termination Time shall provide notice to the other party of any extension of
the Offer Termination Time no later than one business day prior to the then
current Offer Termination Time. 
---|--- 



   3. |

_Offer Acceptance and Extension_. Seller may accept this Offer by executing
and delivering to Buyer a countersignature to the Asset Purchase Agreement no
later than the Offer Termination Time. Delivery 
 Agreement may be made by Seller to Buyer in accordance with the notice
provisions set forth in Section 11.07 of the Asset Purchase Agreement (the "
_Offer Acceptance_ "). Seller agrees that, no later than the second business
day after the date on which each of the competent employees representative
bodies of Seller and its Affiliates in the jurisdictions specified in Exhibit
2 have concluded, or are deemed having concluded according to applicable Law,
the Specified Consultation Processes, Seller shall promptly make a decision
whether or not to accept the Offer, and following such decision, Seller shall
promptly communicate such decision to Buyer and, in the event such decision is
to accept the Offer, promptly deliver the Offer Acceptance. For purposes of
this Offer, the information and/or consultation processes with the
competent employees representative bodies of Seller and its Affiliates in
connection with the Acquisition are collectively referred to as the "
_Consultation Processes_ "; the Consultation Processes in the jurisdictions
specified in Exhibit 2 are referred to as the " _Specified Consultation
Processes_ ". 
---|--- 



   4. | _Acknowledgement_. Buyer hereby confirms to Seller that this
Offer is binding in accordance with its terms, and, except in the event of
termination of this Offer pursuant to paragraph 8, may not be revoked by
Buyer in any respect or for any reason prior to the Offer Termination Time
(other than in the case of a breach by Seller of the terms of paragraph 5
below). Each of Seller and Buyer hereby acknowledges that the other party is
relying on this Offer and the promises, representations, warranties and
covenants contained herein. 
---|--- 



   5. |

_Exclusivity_. Seller hereby agrees that, during the period beginning on the
date hereof and continuing until the earlier of (x) the Offer Acceptance and
(y) the Offer Termination Time (the " _Exclusivity Period_ "), Seller will
not, nor will it permit any of its Affiliates or its or their directors,
officers or employees, or any attorney, accountant or other representative
retained by any of them (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing non-public information), or take any other action designed or
reasonably likely to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative
Proposal (as defined below), (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or otherwise
cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in any effort or attempt
by any Person with respect to, any Alternative Proposal or (iii) enter into
or approve any agreement with respect to any Alternative Proposal. For
purposes of this paragraph 5, the term " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer, or any expression of interest by any third party
relating to Sellers or any Selling Affiliates willingness or ability to
receive or discuss a proposal or offer, other than a proposal or offer by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, for an acquisition or other business
combination relating to twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the assets of the
Business. None of Seller or any of its Affiliates shall release any third
party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality agreement with
respect to the Business to which it is a party and which was entered into with
respect to any potential Alternative Proposal. Seller and its Affiliates
shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to, with respect to
third parties with whom discussions or negotiations with respect to an
Alternative Proposal have been terminated on or prior to the date of this
Offer, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the return or destruction of,
in accordance with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement,
confidential information previously furnished by Seller or any of its
Affiliates, or its or their Representatives, with respect to the Business.
Seller will promptly notify Buyer orally (and then in writing within twenty-
four (24) hours) after it or any of its Affiliates has received any proposal,
inquiry, offer or request relating to or constituting, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal, any request
for discussions or negotiations, or any request for information relating to
the Business in connection with an Alternative Proposal or a potential
Alternative Proposal or for access to the properties or books and records
thereof of which Seller or any of its Affiliates is or becomes aware, or any
amendments to the foregoing. Such notice to Buyer shall indicate the identity
of the person making such proposal and the terms and conditions of such
proposal, if any. Seller shall also promptly provide Buyer with (i) a copy of
any written notice or other written communication from any person informing
Seller or any of its Affiliates that it is considering making, or has made a
proposal regarding, an Alternative Proposal, (ii) a copy of any Alternative
Proposal (or any amendment thereof) received by Seller or any of its
Affiliates and (iii) such other details of any such Alternative Proposal that
Buyer may reasonably request. Thereafter, Seller shall promptly keep
Buyer reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of any material
change to the terms of any such Alternative Proposal. 

---|--- 
 



2 contemplated hereby and by the Asset Purchase Agreement, Buyer and Seller each
hereby agree to comply with the restrictions set forth in Section 6.04 of the
Asset Purchase Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without limiting
either partys ability to make such disclosures as may be required by
applicable Law, in connection with the Consultation Processes Seller may make
available to the applicable employees representative bodies of Seller and its
Affiliates such information as Seller determines is reasonably necessary to
effect such Consultation Processes. 
---|--- 
 



   7. _Consultation_  | _Process_. 
---|--- 



     | a. | Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, comply in
all material respects with all appropriate requirements and procedures in
connection with the Consultation Processes and shall convene meetings of the
competent employees representative bodies as soon as reasonably practicable
with a view to obtaining expeditious delivery of the opinions of such
competent employees representative bodies. Seller shall keep Buyer regularly
informed of the status of matters relating to the delivery of such opinions,
including furnishing Buyer promptly of copies of notices or details of any
substantive material communications obtained by Seller whether orally or in
writing as part of the Consultation Processes. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Seller undertakes to inform Buyer in writing as
soon as possible (and in any event no later than two (2) business days) after
any Consultation Process has concluded, or is deemed concluded according to
applicable Laws; provided, that, notwithstanding anything in this Offer Letter
or in the Asset Purchase Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall not enter
into any agreements, understandings, or commitments with, or for the benefit
of, the employees representative bodies of Seller and its Affiliates, that
could reasonably be expected to result in any liability to Buyer and its
Affiliates on or following the Applicable Closing Date prior to providing
Buyer with reasonable notice and obtaining Buyers consent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld). 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | Without limiting the generality of paragraph 1 of this Offer,
Buyer hereby agrees to cooperate and use its commercially reasonable efforts
to assist Seller (as set forth in Section 6.05 of the Asset
Purchase Agreement) in effecting the Consultation Processes, including
providing such information (including information in respect of Buyers
employee benefit plans, if any) to, and attending such meetings with, the
applicable employees representative bodies, in each case as may be required
by applicable Laws or practices or as may be reasonably requested by Seller or
such employees representative bodies or their respective agents or advisors
in connection with the Consultation Processes. 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | Seller agrees to, and to cause Affiliates that are or will be
parties to any Transactions Documents to comply with Article VI and Section
8.01(b) of the Asset Purchase Agreement during the period from the date of
this Offer to the Offer Termination Time (or, if this Offer is accepted by
Seller in the manner contemplated herein, to the time as set forth in the
Asset Purchase Agreement), as if it and such Affiliates signed the Asset
Purchase Agreement.  
---|---|--- 



     | d. | Seller hereby confirms that, if the Principal Closing Date
occurred on the date hereof, the conditions set forth in Section 5.01(a) of
the Asset Purchase Agreement would be satisfied, and Seller hereby agrees to
not take any action prior to the earlier of (x) the Offer Acceptance and (y)
the Offer Termination Time which would cause such condition to not be
satisfied. 
---|---|--- 
 



   8. _Termination_. | This Offer may be terminated: 
---|--- 



     | a. | by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller; or 
---|---|--- 



     | b. |

by Buyer, by written notice to Seller (such notice to be delivered in
accordance with the notice provisions set forth in Section 11.07 of the Asset
Purchase Agreement), at any time 

---|---|--- 
 



3 in any material respect any of Sellers covenants or agreements contained in
paragraph 5; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may only terminate this
Offer pursuant to this clause (b) if at the time of termination Buyer is not
in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this
Offer. 
---|--- 
 



   9. | _Offer Termination Fee_. 
---|--- 



     | a. | If (i) this Offer is terminated by Buyer pursuant to clause
(b) of paragraph 8 or (ii) (A) any Person shall have made an Alternative
Proposal after the date hereof but prior to the Offer Termination Time, (B)
Seller fails to deliver the Offer Acceptance by the Offer Termination Time and
(C) within twelve (12) months after the Offer Termination Time, Seller or any
of its Affiliates shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect
to any Alternative Proposal or shall have consummated a transaction
contemplated by any Alternative Proposal, then, in each of the cases of clause
(i) or (ii), Seller shall pay to Buyer, in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to a bank account designated in writing by Buyer, an amount equal to
four percent (4%) of the Purchase Consideration (the " _Termination Fee_ ").
Any payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to clause (i) shall be made no
later than five (5) business days following the termination of this Offer by
Buyer, and payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to clause (ii) shall be
made no later than five (5) business days following the earlier of the date on
which Seller or its Affiliate executes the definitive agreement with respect
to the Alternative Proposal or the date on which Seller or its Affiliate
consummates any transaction contemplated by any Alternative Proposal. In the
event that Seller shall have made the Expense Reimbursement payment to Buyer
pursuant to paragraph 9(b) below, then the amount of any Termination Fee shall
be reduced by the amount of such Expense Reimbursement payment. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | b. | If the Offer Acceptance has not been made for any reason
prior to the Offer Termination Time, Seller shall promptly (but in any event
not more than five (5) business days following the Offer Termination Time)
pay to Buyer, in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank
account designated in writing by Buyer, an amount of cash in respect of
Buyers expenses equal to one percent (1%) of the Purchase Consideration (the
" _Expense Reimbursement_ "). 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in this paragraph 9 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Offer, and that, without these agreements, neither Seller
nor Buyer would have entered into this Offer. Accordingly, if Seller fails to
promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this paragraph 9, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Buyer commences any action which results in an award of,
or a judgment against Seller for, the Termination Fee or the Expense
Reimbursement (or any portion thereof), Seller shall pay Buyers reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of
enforcement) in connection with such action. 
---|---|--- 



     | d. | Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event
that this Offer terminates because the Specified Consultation Processes shall
have not concluded, or deemed having concluded according to applicable Law,
by the Offer Termination Time, Buyer has materially breached its obligations
with respect to the Consultation Processes pursuant to clause (b) of paragraph
7 of the failure of Consultation Process, and such breach was the proximate
cause of the failure of the Consultation Processes to conclude, or deemed to
conclude according to applicable Law, by the Offer Termination Time (and
Seller shall have complied with its obligations with respect to such
Consultation Processes), then Buyer shall not be entitled to receive the
Termination Fee pursuant to clause (ii) of paragraph 9(a) or the Expense
Reimbursement pursuant to paragraph 9(b). 
---|---|--- 



   10. |

_Date of the Asset Purchase Agreement; Anti-Trust Filings_. Buyer and Seller
hereby agree that, upon acceptance of the Offer and the execution and
delivery of the Asset Purchase Agreement by Seller, (x) the date of the Asset
Purchase Agreement as used therein shall be deemed to be the date hereof and

Purchase Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof.  
---|--- 



   11. | _Governing Law and Dispute Resolution_. This Offer shall be
governed by the law of the State of New York without reference to any
provisions thereof that would require the application of the laws of any
other jurisdiction. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising from or related
in any way to this Offer or the interpretation, application, breach,

11.13 of the Asset Purchase Agreement. 
---|--- 



   12. | _Incorporation by Reference_. The provisions set forth in
Sections 11.04  11.11 and 11.15 of the Asset Purchase Agreement are hereby

enclosed original copies of this letter only to confirm (i) Sellers

ARTICLE II

_Closings_

 

SECTION 2.01. _Closings._ (a) The closing of the purchase and sale of the
Transferred Assets relating to the Principal Country Units and the assumption
of the Assumed Liabilities relating to the Principal Country Units (the "
_Principal Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and
Moore LLP in New York, New York, at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on the
second business day (or such other date as the parties may mutually agree upon
in writing) following the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, waiver) of the conditions set forth in Article V with respect
to the Principal Closing (excluding those conditions intended to be satisfied
at the Principal Closing but subject to their satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, waiver at such time); _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event shall Buyer be obligated to consummate the Principal
Closing prior to the second business day immediately following the final day
of the Marketing Period (or such date during the Marketing Period specified by
Buyer on at least three (3) business days written notice to Seller (it being
understood that such date may be conditioned upon the simultaneous completion
of the Financing)). The date on which the Principal Closing occurs is referred
to in this Agreement as the " _Principal Closing Date_ ". The Principal
Closing shall be deemed to take effect at 12:00 A.M., local time (in each
Principal Country Unit), on the day immediately following the Principal
Closing Date. The parties hereto specifically acknowledge that time is of the
essence because Sellers intention to exit the Business is or will become
known to its employees, customers, suppliers and others having dealings with
Seller.

 



19 (b) The closing of the transfer of the Transferred Assets relating to each
Non-Principal Country Unit and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities
relating to such Non-Principal Country Unit will occur as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Principal Closing Date on the date agreed to by Buyer
and Seller within the period specified in _Exhibit E_ to the Transition
Services Agreement, so long as the conditions set forth in Article V with
respect to such Non-Principal Country Unit (excluding those conditions
intended to be satisfied at such Closing but subject to their satisfaction or,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver at such time) have
been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waived by such
date (each such date, a " _Non-Principal Country Unit Closing Date_"). During
the period from the Principal Closing Date until the occurrence of the
applicable Non-Principal Country Unit Closing, none of the assets or
liabilities of the applicable Non-Principal Country Unit shall be transferred
to or assumed by Buyer, as the case may be, and Seller shall hold and operate
such Non-Principal Country Unit in a manner consistent with Sellers
obligations under Section 6.01. The parties shall enter into a distribution
arrangement giving effect to the foregoing with respect to such Non-Principal
Country Unit pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement.

 

SECTION 2.02. _Transferred/Excluded Assets; Assumed/Excluded Liabilities_. (a)
_ Transferred Assets._ Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Applicable Closing, Seller will, and will
cause the relevant Selling Affiliates to, sell, convey, assign and transfer to
Buyer, and Buyer will purchase, acquire and accept, all of Sellers and its
Affiliates right, title and interest in the Transferred Assets related to the
applicable Country Unit, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted
Liens. Accordingly, Seller will, or will cause the relevant
Selling Affiliates to, execute and deliver at the Principal Closing a general
assignment and bill of sale in the form of _Exhibit B_ (the " _General
Assignment_ "), a general patent assignment in the form of _Exhibit C_ (the "
_Patent Assignment_ ") and a general trademark assignment in the form of
_Exhibit D_ (the " _Trademark Assignment_ "), the other deliverables set forth
in Section 2.08 and at each Applicable Closing such other instruments of
conveyance, assignment and transfer as Buyer reasonably requests, in each case
to convey to Buyer all of Sellers or each Selling Affiliates right, title
and interest in and to the applicable Transferred Assets. All risk of loss
with respect to the Transferred Assets (whether or not covered by insurance)
shall be on Seller up to the time of the Applicable Closing, whereupon such
risk of loss with respect to the Transferred Assets conveyed at such Closing
shall pass to Buyer.

(b) _Excluded Assets._ Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, Buyer
is not purchasing, pursuant to this Agreement or any of the Transactions,
Sellers (or any of its Affiliates) right, title or interest in any asset
that is not a Transferred Asset. Specifically, Sellers (and any of its
Affiliates) right, title or interest in any Excluded Asset is not being
conveyed to Buyer.

(c) _Assumed Liabilities._ At the Applicable Closing, Buyer shall assume the
Assumed Liabilities related to the applicable Country Unit and shall agree to
pay, perform and discharge when due the liabilities and obligations of Seller
(and its

 



20  Affiliates) in respect of the Assumed Liabilities related to the applicable
Country Unit. Buyer will execute and deliver to Seller at the Principal
Closing an assumption agreement in the form of  _Exhibit E_ (the "
_Assumption Agreement_ ") and at each Non-Principal Country Unit Closing such
other agreements and instruments as Seller reasonably requests (the form and
substance of which shall be mutually agreed between the parties), whereby
Buyer agrees to assume and undertakes to pay, perform and discharge as and
when due, the Assumed Liabilities related to the applicable Country Units. For
the avoidance of doubt, Buyers assumption of the Assumed Liabilities under
this Section 2.02(c) shall not limit, restrict or otherwise modify the
obligations of Seller set forth in Article X of this Agreement.

 

(d) _Excluded Liabilities._ Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall
assume or be obligated to pay, perform or otherwise discharge, whether
presently existing or arising hereafter, any Excluded Liability. Seller and
its Affiliates, as the case may be, will remain liable to pay, perform and
discharge when due, all Excluded Liabilities.

 

(e) _Country Transfer Agreements._ To the extent required by applicable Law,
the transfer of each Country Unit will be effected pursuant to a short-form
agreement or one or more instruments of transfer, such as a bill of sale,
share transfer agreement, business transfer agreement, real estate transfer
agreement or other asset assignment document, which agreement shall be
prepared by Seller and shall be on terms consistent with the applicable terms
of this Agreement and in the form of _Exhibit F_ , with only such changes as
may be required by local Law (each, a " _Country Transfer Agreement_ "). If
required, the parties shall enter into the Country Transfer Agreements as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof and not later than the
relevant Applicable Closing.

 

(f) _Designation of Affiliates._ To the extent that any of the Transferred
Assets are under the control of any of Sellers Affiliates, Seller shall
cause its Affiliates to promptly take such legal action as may be necessary to
consummate the transfer to Buyer and its Affiliates of such Transferred Assets
under terms and conditions of this Agreement. Prior to, and in any event at
least 30 days in advance of, any Applicable Closing, Buyer may designate one
or more Affiliates to, at the Applicable Closing, (i) acquire all or part of
the Transferred Assets, (ii) assume all or part of the Assumed Liabilities or
(iii) pay a designated portion of the Cash Consideration pursuant to Section
2.03, in each case related to the applicable Country Unit, as the case may be,
in which event all references herein to Buyer will be deemed to refer to
such Affiliates, as appropriate; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
designation will in any event limit or affect the obligations of Buyer under
this Agreement to the extent not performed by such Affiliates.

 

(g) _Transferred Assets Subject to Third-Party Consent._ To the extent that
the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery or attempted sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to Buyer (or one of its
Affiliates) of any Transferred Asset is prohibited by any applicable Law or
would require any governmental or third party authorizations, approvals
(including Anti-Trust Approvals), consents or waivers

 



21  and such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers shall not have been
obtained prior to the Applicable Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute
a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or any attempted sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, thereof. For a period of
eighteen months after the Applicable Closing Date, the parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other to obtain promptly such
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers and to give any notices
required for the transfer of such Transferred Asset and to obtain from third
parties an approval or consent to establish a new contract with Buyer or its
designated Affiliate with respect to the portion of any Commingled Contract
related to the Business, pursuant to which Buyer or its designated Affiliate
will have access to the rights and benefits of such Commingled Contract with
respect to the Business on substantially the same terms and conditions
provided to Seller and its Affiliates prior to the Applicable Closing, or to
assign such portion to Buyer or its designated Affiliate; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither party shall be required to pay any consideration or
make any concession therefor. If such authorization, approval, consent or
waiver is obtained, Seller shall promptly assign, transfer, convey or deliver
any such Transferred Asset or, if applicable, that portion of any Commingled
Contract, as the case may be, to Buyer or its designee pursuant to Section
2.02(f) at no additional cost. Pending the earlier of obtaining such
authorization, approval, consent or waiver or the expiration of such eighteen-
month period, the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with
each other in any reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to provide to
Buyer all economic benefits and burdens of any such Transferred Asset. During
such time period, Seller and its applicable Affiliates shall comply with all
applicable covenants and obligations with respect to such Transferred Asset,
including the payment of any costs or expenses in connection therewith, which
shall be performed by Seller or its applicable Affiliate for Buyers account
and Buyer shall promptly (but in no event later than thirty (30) days
following receipt of an invoice from Seller) reimburse Seller for any such
out-of-pocket costs, expenses or payments made by Seller or its applicable
Affiliate in respect of such Transferred Asset. Subject to Sellers compliance
with this Section 2.02(g), Buyer further agrees that no representation,
warranty or covenant of Seller contained in this Agreement shall be breached
or deemed breached, and no condition to Buyers obligations to close the
Transactions shall be deemed not satisfied, solely as a result of the failure
to obtain any authorization, approval, consent or waiver, except that Seller
shall comply with the covenant set forth on Schedule 2.02(g) (it being
understood that this sentence shall not be deemed to impair the rights of
Buyer in respect of any breach of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.07).

(h) _Buyer_ __ _s Recording and Similar Responsibilities._ Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.02, it shall be Buyers
responsibility (i) to prepare the applicable country patent assignments and
trademark assignments from Seller or its applicable Affiliates to Buyer and
to record such assignments following execution thereof by Seller or its
applicable Affiliate, (ii) to apply for its own marketing authorizations for
the Products to the relevant regulatory authorities where it is not within
the power of Seller to cause, by giving notice to the applicable regulatory
authority, the transfer directly to Buyer (or to a third party designee of
Buyer) of the existing marketing authorizations that are Transferred Assets
and (iii) to bear the fees and other costs in accordance with Section
2.06(d). Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide all
reasonable assistance to Buyer in connection with the foregoing at Buyers
expense.

 



22 (i) _Japan Corporate Split._ Seller may elect to transfer, assign and convey
to Buyer on the Applicable Closing Date the Transferred Assets and Assumed
Liabilities relating to Japan by way of an "absorption-type company split"
pursuant to Japan Corporate-Split Law. If Seller so elects, Seller and Buyer
shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, execute and deliver a Country
Transfer Agreement or other document (it being understood that, in the event
of any conflict between this Agreement and any Country Transfer Agreement or
other document, the terms of this Agreement shall control), and to take such
other actions, as may be necessary or desirable to give effect to the
foregoing, including, if applicable, using commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate on any public notice of demerger.

 

SECTION 2.03. _Purchase Price._ (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Principal Closing:

 

Buyer shall (or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates as Buyer may
designate pursuant to Section 2.02(f) to) pay or cause to be paid to Seller
(or one or more of its Affiliates as Seller may designate), in immediately
available funds by wire transfer to one or more bank accounts designated in
writing by Seller at least five business days prior to the Principal Closing
Date, cash in U.S. dollars (subject to Section 2.03(b)) as directed by Seller
in an amount exclusive of any Transfer Taxes equal to One Billion Forty-Five
Million dollars and 00/100 cents ($1,045,000,000.00), _minus_ the Estimated
Excluded Inventory Amount (the " _Cash Consideration_ ").

(b) Buyer shall pay the portion of the Cash Consideration applicable to the
Country Units identified on _Schedule 2.03(b)_ in the applicable Foreign
Currency set forth on such Schedule. The conversion rate from U.S. dollars to
the applicable Foreign Currency shall be the closing rate provided by
Bloomberg at 5:00 A.M. New York City time two (2) business days prior to the
Principal Closing Date. In the event that the portion of the Cash
Consideration allocated to any Non-Principal Country Unit pursuant to Section
2.05 is required by applicable Law to be paid in a Foreign Currency on the
Applicable Closing Date and the portion of the Cash Consideration allocable to
such Country Unit was previously paid by Buyer in U.S. dollars, on the
Applicable Closing Date, (i) Buyer or its Affiliates will pay to Seller an
amount in the applicable Foreign Currency equal to (x) the portion of the Cash
Consideration allocated to such Non-Principal Country Unit in U.S. dollars
multiplied by (y) the Exchange Rate with respect to each Foreign Currency as
of two (2) business days prior to the Applicable Closing Date and (ii)
simultaneously with Buyers or its Affiliates payment pursuant to the
immediately preceding clause (i) Seller or its Affiliates shall refund to
Buyer the portion of the Cash Consideration allocated to such Country Unit
pursuant to Section 2.05 in U.S. dollars.

 



23 (c) The Cash Consideration shall be subject to the adjustment provisions of
Section 2.04 and the Cash Consideration shall be allocated as described in
Section 2.05.

(d) No later than 5 business days prior to the Principal Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer a preliminary schedule setting forth its good faith
estimate of the Estimated Prepaid Tax Amount and the Estimated Excluded
Inventory Amount.

 

SECTION 2.04. _Cash Consideration Adjustment._ (a) For the purposes of
clarification only, Seller is retaining all accounts payable and accounts
receivable with respect to each Country Unit arising out of the operation and
conduct of the Business before the Applicable Closing for such Country Unit
and the only purchase consideration adjustment with respect to changes in
the working capital of the Business after any Closing will be the adjustment
of the Inventory and the Excluded Inventory Amount pursuant to this Section
2.04.

 

(b) Within 120 days after the Applicable Closing Date, Seller shall prepare
and deliver to Buyer a statement in the form of  _Schedule_ __ _ 2.04(b)_
(in its draft form, a " _Consideration Adjustment Statement_ "), setting
forth, with respect to the applicable Country Units, (i) the book value of the
Inventory transferred to Buyer in respect of such Country Unit as of the
Applicable Closing Date (the " _Closing Inventory_ "), (ii) the Prepaid Tax
Amount as of the Principal Closing Date and (iii) the Excluded Inventory
Amount as of the Principal Closing Date. To the extent that the applicable
Closing Inventory (once final and binding pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 2.04) is greater than the applicable Inventory Target or less than the
applicable Inventory Target, the Cash Consideration shall be adjusted as
described in Section 2.04(f) below. To the extent that the Prepaid Tax Amount
(once final and binding pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.04) as of
the Principal Closing Date is greater than the Estimated Prepaid Tax Amount
or less than the Estimated Prepaid Tax Amount, the Cash Consideration shall be
adjusted as described in Section 2.04(g) below. To the extent that the
Excluded Inventory Amount (once final and binding pursuant to the provisions
of this Section 2.04) as of the Principal Closing Date is greater than the
Estimated Excluded Inventory Amount or less than the Estimated Excluded
Inventory Amount, the Cash Consideration shall be adjusted as described
in Section 2.04(h) below.

(c) In connection with the preparation of each Consideration Adjustment
Statement, (i) Buyer shall (A) assist, and shall cause its Affiliates to
assist, Seller, its accountants, advisors and other representatives in its
preparation of each Consideration Adjustment Statement and (B) afford to
Seller, its accountants, advisors and other representatives, reasonable
access during normal business hours to the personnel, properties, books and
records of the Business to the extent relevant to the preparation of any
Consideration Adjustment Statement (including any taking and preparing of
physical counts of Inventory) and (ii) Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to provide Buyer, its accountants, advisors and other
representatives with any reasonably requested information, data or back-up
materials with respect to Buyers review of any Consideration Adjustment
Statement. For purposes of this Section 2.04, the calculation

 



24  of the Excluded Inventory Amount and the book value of the Inventory will
reflect any accounting reserves or adjustments (including for obsolescence)
and otherwise be determined in a manner consistent with Sellers inventory
and other relevant accounting policies used in the preparation of the
2014/2015 Draft Financial Statements (the " _Inventory Accounting Policies_
").

 

(d) Each Consideration Adjustment Statement shall become final and binding
upon the parties on the 45th day following receipt thereof by Buyer unless
Buyer gives written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_
") to Seller prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature and amount of any disagreement so asserted. If a
timely Notice of Disagreement is received by Seller, then the relevant
Consideration Adjustment Statement (as revised in accordance with clause (x)
or (y) below) shall become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier
of (x) the date the parties hereto resolve any differences they have with
respect to any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (y) the date
any matters in dispute are resolved by an accounting firm (in accordance with
the procedure set forth in this Section 2.04) selected by Seller and Buyer
or, if the parties are unable to agree, an independent accounting firm
selected by Sellers and Buyers independent accounting firms (such firm, the
" _Accounting Firm_ ").

(e) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that the dispute resolution
provisions set forth in Section 11.13 shall not apply to any dispute
described in this Section 2.04. During the 30-day period immediately following
the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall seek in good
faith to resolve in writing any differences they may have with respect to any
matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 30-day
period, Seller and Buyer shall submit for review and resolution by
the Accounting Firm any and all matters which remain in dispute and which
were included in the Notice of Disagreement, and the Accounting Firm shall
make a final determination of the values set forth on the relevant
Consideration Adjustment Statement (and shall use such determination to
prepare the relevant final Consideration Adjustment Statement ), which
determination shall be binding on the parties; _provided_ , _however_ , the
scope of such determination by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to: (i)
those matters that remain in dispute and that were included in the Notice of
Disagreement, (ii) whether, for each calculation of Inventory, such
calculation was prepared in accordance with this Section 2.04, specifically,
whether the Inventory Accounting Policies were used, and (iii) whether there
were mathematical errors in the relevant Consideration Adjustment Statement ,
and the Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted to make any
other determination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted to make any determination as to
the accuracy of Section 3.06 or any other representation or warranty in this
Agreement or as to compliance by Seller, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates with any of the covenants in this Agreement (other than this
Section 2.04). The relevant Consideration Adjustment Statement shall become
final and binding on Buyer and Seller on the date the Accounting Firm
delivers the relevant final Consideration Adjustment Statement to the parties.
The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.04
shall be borne one-half each by Buyer and Seller.

 



25 (f) If the Consideration Adjustment Statement discloses that the book value of
the applicable Closing Inventory exceeds the applicable Inventory Target,
then the amount of such excess shall be added on a dollar-for-dollar basis to
the Cash Consideration. If the Consideration Adjustment Statement discloses
that the book value of the applicable Closing Inventory is less than the
applicable Inventory Target, then the Cash Consideration shall be reduced on a
dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such deficit. If the Consideration
Adjustment Statement discloses that the book value of the applicable Closing
Inventory is equal to the applicable Inventory Target, then there shall be no
adjustment to the Cash Consideration in respect of the Applicable Closing.

(g) If the Consideration Adjustment Statement discloses that the Prepaid Tax
Amount as of the Principal Closing Date exceeds the Estimated Prepaid Tax
Amount, then the amount of such excess shall be added on a dollar-for-dollar
basis to the Cash Consideration. If the Consideration Adjustment Statement
discloses that the Prepaid Tax Amount as of the Principal Closing Date
is less than the Estimated Prepaid Tax Amount, then the Cash Consideration
shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such deficit.
If the Consideration Adjustment Statement discloses that the Prepaid Tax
Amount as of the Principal Closing Date is equal to the Estimated Prepaid Tax
Amount, then there shall be no Prepaid Tax Amount adjustment to the Cash
Consideration in respect of the Principal Closing.

(h) If the Consideration Adjustment Statement discloses that the Excluded
Inventory Amount as of the Principal Closing Date exceeds the Estimated
Excluded Inventory Amount, then the Cash Consideration shall be reduced by the
amount of such excess on a dollar-for-dollar basis. If the Consideration
Adjustment Statement discloses that the Excluded Inventory Amount as of the
Principal Closing Date is less than the Estimated Excluded Inventory Amount,
then the amount of such deficit shall be added on a dollar-for-dollar basis
to the Cash Consideration. If the Consideration Adjustment Statement discloses
that the Excluded Inventory Amount as of the Principal Closing Date is equal
to the Estimated Excluded Inventory Amount, then there shall be no Excluded
Inventory Amount adjustment to the Cash Consideration in respect of the
Principal Closing.

 

(i) No payment pursuant to this Section 2.04 need be made by either party
until the date that is 15 business days after the determination of each final
Consideration Adjustment Statement (the " _Cash Consideration Adjustment Due
Date_ "); _provided_ that, on or before any Cash Consideration Adjustment Due
Date, (i) Buyer (or one or more of its Affiliates as may be designated by
Buyer) shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller (or one or more of the Selling
Affiliates as may be designated by Seller), in immediately available funds by
wire transfer to one or more bank accounts designated in writing by Seller at
least two (2) business days prior to such Cash Consideration Adjustment Due
Date, cash in U.S. dollars (or, with respect to any Cash Consideration
adjustment for any Country Unit for which a portion of the Cash Consideration
was paid in a Foreign Currency pursuant to Section 2.03(b), and to the extent
payment in a Foreign Currency is required by applicable Law, in such Foreign
Currency at the Exchange Rate as determined pursuant to Section 1.02(c)) as
directed by Seller in an amount equal to the

 



26  positive Cash Consideration adjustment under Section 2.04(f), Section
2.04(g) or Section 2.04(h), if any, or (ii) Seller (or one or more of its
Affiliates as may be designated by Seller) shall pay or cause to be paid to
Buyer (or one or more of its Affiliates as may be designated by Buyer), in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to one or more bank accounts
designated in writing by Buyer at least two (2) business days prior to such
Cash Consideration Adjustment Due Date, cash in U.S. dollars (or, with respect
to any Cash Consideration adjustment for any Country Unit for which a portion
of the Cash Consideration was paid in a Foreign Currency pursuant to Section
2.03(b), and to the extent payment in a Foreign Currency is required by
applicable Law, in such Foreign Currency at the Exchange Rate as determined
pursuant to Section 1.02(c)) as directed by Buyer in an amount equal to the
negative Cash Consideration adjustment under Section 2.04(f), Section 2.04(g)
or Section 2.04(h), if any.

 

SECTION 2.05. _Allocation of Cash Consideration._ (a) Buyer and Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on an allocation of the Cash
Consideration and Assumed Liabilities (the " _Allocation_ ") as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Principal
Closing Date. The Allocation shall allocate the Cash Consideration and
Assumed Liabilities among the Transferred Assets of each Selling Affiliate in
a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and this Section 2.05.

 

(b) Within 120 calendar days after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall
deliver a draft of the Allocation (the " _Proposed Allocation_ ") to Buyer.
Except as provided in Sections 2.05(c) and (d), at the close of business on
the 45th calendar day after delivery of the Proposed Allocation, the Proposed
Allocation shall become binding upon Buyer and Seller, shall be set forth on
_Schedule 2.05(b)_ (the " _Allocation Schedule_ "), and shall be the
Allocation.

(c) Buyer shall raise any objection (so long as such objection is reasonable)
to the Proposed Allocation in writing within 45 calendar days of the delivery
of the Proposed Allocation. Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve any differences within 30 calendar days after delivery of Buyers
objection. If Buyer and Seller reach written agreement amending the Proposed
Allocation within 30 calendar days after delivery of Buyers objection, the
Proposed Allocation, as so amended, shall become binding upon Buyer and
Seller, shall be set forth in the Allocation Schedule, and shall be the
Allocation.

(d) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that the dispute resolution
provisions set forth in Section 11.13 of this Agreement shall not apply to any
dispute described in this Section 2.05. If Buyer and Seller cannot agree on
the Allocation within the time period set forth in Section 2.05(c), then all
remaining disputed items shall be submitted for resolution by an independent
appraisal firm mutually selected by Buyer and Seller as promptly as
practicable. Buyer and Seller shall each request that the independent
appraisal firm make a final determination as to the disputed items, including
the valuation methodology (if at issue), within 30 calendar days after such
submission. Any additional data requested by the independent appraisal firm
at its sole discretion in

 



27  order to make a final determination shall be delivered by the parties to the
independent appraisal firm in a timely manner. The Proposed Allocation shall
be amended in accordance with the findings of such independent appraisal
firm, and the Proposed Allocation, as so amended, shall become binding upon
Buyer and Seller, shall be set forth in the Allocation Schedule, and shall be
the Allocation. The fees, costs and expenses of the independent appraisal
firm pursuant to this Section 2.05(d) shall be borne equally by Buyer and
Seller.

(e) The Allocation shall be amended to reflect any adjustments (including
those described in Section 2.04) to the Cash Consideration under this
Agreement, and any other adjustments mutually agreed to between the parties.
If, after all adjustments to the Allocation are made, the Allocation with
respect to the Closing Inventory of any Selling Affiliate, when expressed in
the relevant local currency at the Exchange Rate used to determine the Closing
Inventory, is different from the local currency net book value recorded on
the statutory books for the Closing Inventory of such Selling Affiliate as of
the Applicable Closing Date, then the Allocation with respect to the Closing
Inventory of such Selling Affiliate shall be adjusted so that it is equal to
such local currency net book value, and the parties will agree to a
corresponding upward or downward adjustment (as appropriate) elsewhere in the
Allocation.

 

(f) Each of Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall prepare and
file its Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594) on a basis consistent with the
Allocation and shall take no position inconsistent with the Allocation on any
Tax Return or in any proceeding before any Taxing Authority or otherwise,
except as otherwise required by applicable Law. In the event that
the Allocation is disputed by any Taxing Authority, the party receiving
notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other party hereto, and both
Seller and Buyer agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to defend
such Allocation in any audit or similar proceeding, and the dispute shall be
governed by the procedures for Claims in Section 10.05; _provided_ that
neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to litigate before any court any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing Authority challenging such
Allocation.

(g) In the event that the Allocation has not become final pursuant to
this Section 2.05 by the Applicable Closing:

(i) The allocated purchase consideration included in the Proposed
Allocation shall be used for the purpose of (A) including allocated purchase
consideration in the Country Transfer Agreements for each Country Unit and (B)
determining the amount of any payments made on the Principal Closing Date to
the applicable Selling Affiliate with respect to such Country Unit. The
inclusion of such allocated purchase consideration shall not be deemed to
waive, amend or otherwise alter any of the rights or obligations of the
parties set forth in this Section 2.05 and shall not be used for any purpose
in resolving, or result in any prejudice with respect to, any dispute with
respect to the Proposed Allocation or the Allocation.

 



28 (ii) To the extent that the amounts paid to any Selling Affiliate on
the Principal Closing Date are not equal to the portion of the Cash
Consideration and Assumed Liabilities allocated to the Transferred Assets of
such Selling Affiliate in the Allocation, as adjusted pursuant to Section
2.05(e) (with respect to any Selling Affiliate, the " _Allocated Cash
Consideration_ "), the parties shall and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to take all necessary actions to refund, repay and redistribute as
promptly as reasonably practicable any amounts paid to any Selling Affiliate
in excess of such Selling Affiliates Allocated Cash Consideration, such that,
after giving effect to any such refunds, repayments and redistributions, the
amounts received by each Selling Affiliate shall be equal to such Selling
Affiliates Allocated Cash Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to Section
2.05(e).

SECTION 2.06. _Transfer Taxes and Other Costs._ (a) All Transfer Taxes
payable in connection with the transfer of the Transferred Assets to Buyer and
the Transactions shall be borne and paid solely by Buyer when due in
compliance with applicable Transfer Tax laws;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
if Seller determines (in accordance with Section 2.06(c)) that it is required
by applicable Law to pay any Transfer Taxes, then Seller shall pay such
Transfer Taxes, and Buyer shall, subject to receipt of reasonably
satisfactory evidence of Sellers payment thereof, promptly reimburse Seller
in dollars (or, at Sellers request, reimburse a Selling Affiliate in local
currency), whether or not such Transfer Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed by the applicable Governmental Entity.

(b) Seller and Buyer shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation required to be filed by it with respect to all Transfer Taxes,
and, if required by applicable Law, the parties will, and will cause their
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. In order to assist Seller with invoicing, as soon as

in) Transfer Taxes is available with respect to the consummation of the
Transactions shall be made by Seller in its reasonable discretion after having
reasonably consulted with Buyer and taking into account any reasonable
comments made by Buyer as part of such consultation. In making such
determination, Seller and Buyer shall take into account any duly completed
exemption certificates delivered to Seller from Buyer no later than 10
calendar days prior to the Applicable Closing Date to which the certificate
relates.

any such amount shall be incurred by Seller, Buyer shall, subject to receipt
of satisfactory evidence of Sellers payment thereof, promptly reimburse
Seller.

(e) All reasonable costs and expenses associated with removing and moving
any Transferred Asset to a location designated by Buyer shall be borne and
paid solely by Buyer when due; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such
amount shall be incurred by Seller, Buyer shall, subject to receipt of
satisfactory evidence of Sellers payment thereof, promptly reimburse Seller.

SECTION 2.07. _Withholding Taxes._ Buyer is permitted to withhold
amounts from the Cash Consideration as required under applicable Law.
However, within 15 days prior to the expected Principal Closing Date, Buyer
shall deliver a schedule of expected withholding amounts to Seller (which
schedule, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be prepared in accordance with
Section 2.05(g) in the event that the Allocation has not yet been finalized by
the time such schedule is prepared by Buyer). Furthermore, Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate with Seller to reduce the amount of withholding Taxes
imposed on the payment of the Cash Consideration, including by executing and
filing any forms or certificates reasonably required to claim an available
reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding Taxes. To the extent
that amounts are withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such withholding was made.

reasonably agreed upon by the parties; and

(viii) such other instruments of transfer or conveyance as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer or may be necessary to effect the transfer of the

31 ARTICLE III

 

 _Representations and Warranties of Seller_

 

Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the Transaction Documents, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that the Transferred Assets are sold "as is, where
is" and Buyer agrees to accept the Transferred Assets on the relevant Closing
Date in the condition they are in at the place they are located on such
Closing Date based on its own inspection, examination and determination with
respect to all matters, and without reliance upon any express or implied
representations or warranties of any nature made by, on behalf of or imputed
to Seller. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer
acknowledges that Seller makes no representation or warranty, express or
implied, with respect to (i) any forecasts, projections, estimates or budgets
provided or made available to Buyer of future revenues, future results of
operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows or future financial
condition (or any component thereof) of the Business or (ii) any other
information or documents provided or made available to Buyer or its counsel,
accountants or advisors with respect to the Business, in each case except as
expressly set forth in the Transaction Documents. BUYER AGREES THAT THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES GIVEN IN THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS BY SELLER
ARE IN LIEU OF, AND, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF FRAUD, BUYER HEREBY EXPRESSLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES THAT MAY OTHERWISE BE APPLICABLE
BECAUSE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE OR ANY OTHER STATUTE,
INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. 

Subject to the foregoing and except as set forth in the schedules to the
Disclosure Letter (each of which relates to the corresponding Section of
this Agreement and to each other Section of this Agreement to the extent its
applicability is reasonably apparent based on the content and context of such
disclosure), Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

 

SECTION 3.01. _Organization and Good Standing_ _._ Each of Seller and the
Selling Affiliates is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing (where such concept is recognized in the relevant jurisdiction)
under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease and operate its
respective properties relating to the Business and to carry on the Business as
now being operated and conducted.

SECTION 3.02.  _Authority_ _._ Seller has full power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and the Final Binding Offer Letter and to carry
out, or cause to be carried out, the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Seller and each of the Selling Affiliates have, or will have at the
Applicable Closing, full power and

 



32  authority to execute and deliver each Transaction Document (other than this
Agreement and the Final Binding Offer Letter) to which it is or will be a
party and to carry out, or cause to be carried out, the transactions
contemplated by each of the Transaction Documents (other than this Agreement
and the Final Binding Offer Letter) to which it is or will be a party. This
Agreement and the Final Binding Offer Letter have been duly authorized by all
necessary action on the part of Seller and have been duly executed and
delivered by Seller and constitute valid and legally binding obligations of
Seller in accordance with their terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and (b) the
availability of injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. Each of the
Transaction Documents (other than this Agreement and the Final Binding Offer
Letter) has been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Seller
and each Selling Affiliate and has been, or will be at the Applicable Closing,
duly executed and delivered by Seller and each Selling Affiliate and
constitutes or will constitute a valid and legally binding obligation of
Seller and each such Selling Affiliate in accordance with its terms, except as

other equitable remedies.

on _Schedule 3.03(a)_ _,_ Seller or a Selling Affiliate has good and valid
title to, or the right to transfer (or cause to be transferred) in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, all the material tangible Transferred
Assets, free and clear of any Liens other than Permitted Liens. This Section
3.03 does not relate to Transferred Real Property or interests in Transferred
Real Property, such items being the subject of Section 3.05.

 

SECTION 3.04. _Assets of the Business_ _._ The Transferred Assets, together
with (a) the Shared Services, (b) the services to be provided by the Selling
Affiliates to Buyer and its Affiliates pursuant to the Ancillary Agreements
and (c) the Excluded Assets set forth or described in clauses (i)  (xx) of
_Annex 2.02(b)_ , constitute all of the assets used in the Business as it is
conducted as of the date of this Agreement. Except as set forth on _Schedule
3.04_ , the Transferred Assets, together with (i) the Shared Services, (ii)
the services to be provided by the Selling Affiliates to Buyer and its
Affiliates pursuant to the Ancillary Agreements and (iii) the Excluded Assets

for the conduct of the Business in substantially the same manner as it is
conducted as of the date of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 3.05. _Transferred Real Property_ _._ (a) None of the real property
owned by Seller or a Selling Affiliate is primarily used in the operation of
the Business. _Schedule 2.02(a)(i)_ sets forth, as of the date of this
Agreement, (i) all of the real property leased, subleased or licensed by
Seller or a Selling Affiliate and primarily used in the operation of the
Business and (ii) all leases, subleases, licenses, concessions or other
agreements, written or oral, granting to any party or parties the right of use
or occupancy of any portion of the Transferred Real Property. Seller or a
Selling Affiliate has good and valid title to the Transferred Real Property,
free and clear of any Liens, other than Permitted Liens.

 



33 (b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.05(b)_ and except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in
material liability to the Business or otherwise materially impair the
operation of the Business, (i) all improvements located on the Transferred
Real Property have received all necessary approvals of Governmental Entities
(including licenses and permits) required in connection with the present use
thereof, (ii) there are no judicial or administrative actions or proceedings

dates indicated therein, and (y) related direct net revenues and total net
expenses for the fiscal years indicated therein and (iii) such financial

conditions of the SEC Waiver, and otherwise in accordance with GAAP, applied
on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered thereby (it being
understood that the representation and warranty in this clause (iii) assumes

an obligation on the part of Seller or its Affiliates to publicly file the
2014/2015/2016 Audited Financial Statements with the SEC.

(b) The 2014/2015 Draft Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance

adjustments that are not, individually or in the aggregate, material to the
Business.

 



34 (d) The Comparative Quarterly Financial Statements, when delivered pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement (and, for the avoidance of doubt, at the

indicated therein, and (y) related direct net revenues and total net expenses

with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered
thereby (it being understood that the representation and warranty in this
clause (iii) assumes that such financial statements have previously been
publicly filed with the SEC). For the avoidance of doubt, this assumption
shall not be construed to be an obligation on the part of Seller or any of
its Affiliates to publicly file the Comparative Quarterly Financial Statements
with the SEC.

 

(e) There are no material liabilities included in the Assumed Liabilities,
except (i) as included, reserved against or reflected in the 2014/2015 Draft

SECTION 3.07.  _Consents and Approvals; Absence of Violation or_

otherwise operate the Business, which consent, approval, authorization or
permit is standard in transactions of the type contemplated hereby, (iii) any
consent, approval, authorization or permit required to be obtained solely by
reason of Buyers (as opposed to any third partys) participation in the
Transactions and (iv) where the failure to obtain any such consent, approval,
authorization or permit, or to make such filing or notification, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in material
liability to the Business or otherwise materially impair the operation of the
Business and would not adversely affect, in any material respect, the ability
of Seller or any of the Selling Affiliates to consummate the Transactions;

 



35  (c) violate any Law applicable to Seller, the Business or the Transferred
Assets, except such violations that would not, individually or in the

consummate the Transactions; (d) result in a material violation or breach of,

the Business and ownership and use of the Transferred Assets by each of
Seller and the Selling Affiliates are not, and since January 1, 2015 have not
been, in violation of any applicable Laws, except such violations that would

material liability to the Business or otherwise materially impair the
operation of the Business. Since January 1, 2015, no Seller or Selling
Affiliate has (i) received any written notification from any Governmental
Entity asserting that Seller or any of its Affiliates is not in compliance
with any Law with respect to the Business or the Transferred Assets or (ii) to
the knowledge of Seller, been subject of an investigation, audit or review by
a Governmental Entity, except, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in
material liability to the Business or otherwise materially impair the
operation of the Business. Seller (or a Selling Affiliate) has all permits,

Business or otherwise materially impair the operation of the Business. As of
the date hereof, each Permit is valid and in full force and effect, in each
case except for instances where the failure to be valid and in full force and
effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in material liability to the Business or otherwise materially impair
the operation of the Business. This Section 3.08 does not relate to labor and
employee matters, employee benefit matters or environmental matters, such
items being the subject of Sections 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14, respectively. This

Benefit Plans.

which he or she is a party.

doubt, terms with respect to information covered by Section 8.01(b) or
employee names or addresses) shall have been made available in the Data Room
as soon as practicable after the date hereof and in no event later than thirty
(30) days prior to the Principal Closing Date; (iii) with respect to each
Assumed Benefit Plan that provides 

 



42  defined benefit pension or retiree medical benefits, a good faith estimate
of the accumulated benefit obligation or accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation of such Assumed Benefit Plan, as applicable, with respect to
liabilities that, to the knowledge of Seller, may become obligations of the
Buyer or its Affiliates, shall have been delivered to Buyer as of the date of
this Agreement; and (iv) with respect to any Assumed Benefit Plan described
in the preceding clause (iii) that is funded, a good faith estimate of the
value of the assets of such plan that, to the knowledge of Seller, may
transfer to Buyer, shall have been delivered to Buyer as of the date of
this Agreement. No Assumed Benefit Plan is maintained in, or covers

fund), if intended to be funded and/or book-reserved, is fully funded and/or
book reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions and
as required by applicable Law.

(f) There are no material pending or threatened claims (other than claims for
benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been
asserted in respect of Assumed Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected
to result in any material liability to any Governmental Entity, any
participant in any Assumed Benefit Plan or any other party.

(g) Subject to Buyers compliance with its obligations under Section 8.01,
there does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could reasonably
be expected to result in any Controlled Group Liability of Seller or its
Affiliates that could be a liability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates
following the Applicable Closing Date in respect of any employee benefit plan
maintained or contributed to by Seller and its Affiliates and that is not an
Assumed Benefit Plan. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Controlled Group
Liability_ " means any and all liabilities (A) under Title IV of ERISA, (B)

relating to the exercise by an Employee of the Business of any rights under

employment to Buyer or any of its Affiliates and any right to reject an offer
of employment from Buyer or any of its Affiliates). The consummation of the

payment" under Section 280G of the Code.

or will be at the Applicable Closing, duly executed and delivered by Buyer and
each such Affiliate of Buyer and constitutes or will constitute valid and
legally binding obligations of Buyer and each such Affiliate of Buyer in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (i)
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and (ii)
the availability of injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.

SECTION 4.02. _Consents and Approvals; Absence of Violation or_ _ _
_Conflicts_ _._ Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of
the other Transaction Documents by Buyer and each Affiliate of Buyer that is a
party to any Transaction Document, nor the consummation by Buyer and
each Affiliate of Buyer that is a party to any Transaction Document of the
Transactions nor compliance by Buyer and each Affiliate of Buyer that is a
party to any Transaction Document with any of the provisions hereof or
thereof, including the Financing shall: (a) conflict with, violate or result

incorporation, by-laws or similar organizational documents or (ii) any

party to any Transaction Document; (b) require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any

SECTION 4.03. _Litigation_ _._ As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
Actions pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened in writing
concerning Buyer or any of its Affiliates relating to the Transactions.

 

SECTION 4.04. _Financing_ _._ Buyer has delivered to Seller true and complete
copies of (a) the executed commitment letter and Redacted Fee Letter, each
dated as of the date hereof, between Buyer and Bank of America, N.A. (" _BofA_
"), Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Incorporated and JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. (" _JPMCB_ "), and (b) the executed administrative agency Redacted Fee
Letter, dated as of the date hereof, between Buyer and BofA (such agreements,
as may be modified pursuant to Section 6.06, the " _Financing Commitments_ "),
pursuant to which each of BofA and JPMCB has agreed, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, to lend the amounts set

 



50  forth therein __for the purpose of funding the Transactions and related fees
and expenses (and, in the event the Amendment referenced therein is not
obtained, to refinance existing indebtedness of Buyer specified in the
Financing Commitments). Each of the Financing Commitments, in the form so
delivered, is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Buyer and the other parties thereto, except as may be limited
by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
Laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and (ii) the
availability of injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. As of
the date hereof, the Financing Commitments have not been amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified in any respect, no amendment, supplement or
modification is contemplated, and the financing commitments thereunder have
not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. As of the date
hereof, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach
on the part of Buyer or any other parties thereto under any term or condition
of the Financing Commitments, and as of the date hereof, Buyer has no reason
to believe that any term or condition of closing set forth in the Financing
Commitments will not be satisfied on a timely basis, or that any portion of
the Financing to be made thereunder will otherwise not be available to Buyer
on a timely basis to consummate the Transactions at the time required pursuant
to this Agreement. Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other
fees required by the Financing Commitments to be paid thereunder on or prior
to the date of this Agreement and shall in the future pay any such fees as
they become due in accordance with the terms of the Financing. The Financing,
when funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments or the Alternate
Financing Commitments, together with cash on hand or other sources of
immediately available funds, will provide Buyer with funds sufficient to
satisfy all of Buyers obligations under this Agreement, including the
obligations under Article II, pay any other amounts required to be paid by
Buyer in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and pay all
related fees and expenses of Buyer (and, in the event the Amendment
referenced therein is not obtained, to refinance existing indebtedness of
Buyer specified in the Financing Commitments). As of the date of this
Agreement, the obligations to make the Financing available to Buyer pursuant
to the terms of the Financing Commitments are not subject to any conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments.
As of the date of this Agreement, there are no contracts or other agreements,
arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written) or commitments to
enter into agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether oral or
written) to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party related to the
Financing other than as expressly contained in the Financing Commitments and
delivered to Seller prior to the date hereof.

 

SECTION 4.05. _Solvency_ _._ Assuming (i) satisfaction of the conditions to
Buyers obligation to consummate the Transactions, and after giving effect to
the Transactions and the payment of the Cash Consideration, any repayment or
refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing
Commitments, (ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
Seller set forth in Article III hereof in all material respects, and (iii)
consummation of the Financing, Buyer and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated
basis taken as a whole, will be Solvent immediately after the completion of
the Applicable Closing. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Solvent_ " when used with respect to any person, means that, as of any date
of determination (A) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of
such person will, as of such date, exceed (1) the value of all "liabilities of
such person, including contingent and other

 



51  liabilities", as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined
in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency
of debtors, and (2) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of such person, as of such date, on its existing debts (including
contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature,
(B) such person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount
of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged following such date, and such person will be able to
pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they
mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such
person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset
dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations
as they become due.

 

SECTION 4.06. _Brokerage Fees_ _._ Except for fees payable to Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated (which fees are payable by Buyer), there
are no claims for brokerage commissions, finders fees or similar compensation
in connection with the Transactions based on any arrangement or agreement made
by or on behalf of Buyer or any Affiliate thereof.

the case of Buyer, not to be satisfied, it being understood and agreed,

its respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Transactions.
Buyer and Seller shall, to the extent practicable, provide each other and
their respective counsel with advance notice of and the opportunity to
participate in any in-person discussion or meeting with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection
with the Transactions and to participate in the preparation for such
discussion or meeting. Buyer also agrees to keep Seller fully informed about
any anti-trust issues raised by any Governmental Entity. Buyer shall (after
consulting with and considering in good faith the views of Seller) in its sole
discretion control all aspects of the Parties efforts to gain Anti-Trust
Approvals before any Governmental Entity or in any Action brought to enjoin
the Transactions pursuant to any anti-trust or competition Law, and Seller
shall cooperate with Buyer to assist in any defense of the Transactions before
any Governmental Entity reviewing the Transactions, including by providing as
promptly as reasonably practicable such information as may be requested by
such Governmental Entity or such assistance as may be reasonably requested by
the Buyer in such defense.

 

(d) For purposes of this Section 6.05, to the extent necessary to obtain the
waiver or consent from any Governmental Entity required to satisfy the
conditions set forth in Sections 5.01(f) or 5.02(f), as applicable, to obtain
consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications or orders of Governmental
Entities or to avoid the entry of or have lifted, vacated or terminated
any Principal Closing Legal Impediment or Non-Principal Closing Legal
Impediment, Buyer shall: (i) propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect
(and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree,
hold separate order or otherwise, and in connection with the consummation of
the Transactions, the sale, divestiture or disposition (including by licensing
any intellectual property rights) of any assets of the Business and/or
any other assets or businesses of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (or equity
interests held by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in entities with assets or
businesses); (ii) terminate or modify any existing relationships and
contractual rights and obligations; (iii) otherwise offer to take or offer to
commit to take any action which it is capable of taking and, if the offer is
accepted, take or commit to take such action, that limits its freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to retain,

 



61  any of the assets of the Business and/or any other assets or businesses of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (or equity interests held by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates in entities with assets or businesses); and (iv) take
promptly, in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other
order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any
proceeding that would make consummation of the Transactions unlawful or that
would prevent or delay consummation of the Transactions, any and all steps
(including the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the
steps contemplated by clauses (i) and (ii) of this subsection (d))
necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order. For the
avoidance of doubt, Buyers obligations under this Section 6.05(d) shall be
absolute and shall not be qualified or limited by what may be considered
commercially reasonable. 

(e) To assist Buyer in complying with its obligations set forth in this
Section 6.05, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with
Buyer and its Affiliates to effect any of the actions described in Section
6.05(d), including by entering into one or more agreements reasonably
requested by Buyer to be entered into by any of them prior to the
Applicable Closing with respect to any of the matters contemplated by clauses
(i) and (ii) of subsection (d) above; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) such
actions shall relate exclusively to the Transferred Assets, (ii)
the effectiveness of such agreement shall be conditioned on the occurrence of
the Applicable Closing, (iii) except with respect to the matters addressed in
Section 8.02, all rights and obligations of Seller and its Affiliates pursuant
thereto shall be assumed by Buyer effective at the Applicable Closing (and
any counterparty shall agree to that effect) and (iv) except with respect to
the matters addressed in Section 8.02, Buyer shall indemnify for and hold
Seller and its Affiliates harmless from all Damages arising from or relating
to any such agreement, it being the intent of the parties that Seller and its
Affiliates and Buyer and its Affiliates shall be treated as if any such
transaction was effected for the account of Buyer and its Affiliates;
_provided, further_ , that none of the provisions of (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv)
of the immediately preceding proviso shall be construed to affect Buyers
rights with respect to Seller hereunder or under the Ancillary Agreements,
including its rights to indemnification under Article X hereof. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, if and promptly after being
requested by Buyer, Sellers and its Affiliates obligation to cooperate with
Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.05(e) shall include (A) entering into
confidentiality agreements containing customary terms with any Persons who
Buyer identifies to Seller as potential purchasers in a potential transaction
of a type described in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 6.05(d) (" _Potential
Purchasers_ "), (B) providing to Buyer and Potential Purchasers such business
and financial information (to the extent readily available) relating to the
assets of the Business that are to be transferred as part of any such
transaction as requested by Buyer or such Potential Purchasers, including such
financial information described in _Schedule_ __ _ 6.05(e)_, (C) making any
appropriate personnel with expertise in the Business available to Buyer and
any Potential Purchasers to participate in a reasonable number (and at
reasonable times) of due diligence sessions and management presentations
related to any such transaction, (D) using commercially reasonable efforts to
provide customary authorization letters to a Potential Purchasers financing
sources authorizing the distribution of information to such Potential
Purchasers lenders or investors, subject to customary confidentiality
requirements and receipt by the applicable

 



62  party of release and non-reliance letters, each reasonably acceptable to
Seller and Sellers auditors or other agents, as applicable, and (E)
negotiating and entering into transitional service and manufacturing
agreements required to obtain approval by the Federal Trade Commission with
buyers of divested products as to which Seller retains assets, as necessary to
facilitate effective transition of products to new owners ( _provided_ that
such transitional service and manufacturing agreements are of no greater scope
and on no less favorable terms to Seller and its Affiliates than the scope and
terms reflected in the applicable Ancillary Agreements).

(f) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, give Buyer and its
accountants, legal counsel and other representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours and without undue interruption of the Business
throughout the period prior to the Applicable Closing, to all of the
properties, books and records (other than records relating to income Taxes
and attorney-client privileged communications and, for the avoidance of doubt,
other than where access to such information is prohibited by applicable Law)
to the extent relating to the Business, and will furnish, at Buyers expense,
Buyer, its accountants, legal counsel and other representatives during such
period all such information (other than records relating to income Taxes and
attorney-client privileged communications and, for the avoidance of doubt,
other than where access to such information is prohibited by applicable Law)
to the extent relating to the Business as Buyer may reasonably request;
_provided_ that this Section 6.05(f) shall not entitle Buyer or its
accountants, legal counsel or other representatives to contact any third
party doing business with Seller or access the properties, books or records of
any such third party or of Seller or its Affiliates to the extent related to
any business of Seller or its Affiliates other than the Business, in each
case without Sellers prior written consent; _provided_ , that in the event
any such books and records or information is subject to attorney-client
privilege or such access is prohibited by Law, Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide access to the information in a manner that would
not violate such privilege or Law. Buyer will hold in confidence all
information so obtained.

 

(g) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all Product Registrations required to operate
the Business in the Non-Principal Country Units, and Seller shall reasonably
cooperate and furnish to Buyer such assistance as Buyer may reasonably request
in connection with the foregoing.

 

SECTION 6.06. _Financing._ (a) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws, and to execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, such instruments and documents as may be
required, to obtain the Financing as promptly as reasonably practicable on
the terms (including the "market flex" provisions) and subject only to the
conditions contained in the Financing Commitments (and, if applicable in the
case of the Alternate Financing, only those conditions specified in the
Financing Commitments as being applicable to the Alternate Financing),
including to (i) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect
to the Financing on the terms (including the "market flex" provisions) and
subject only to the conditions contained in the Financing Commitments (and, if
applicable in the case of the Alternate Financing, only those conditions
specified in the Financing Commitments as being applicable to the Alternate
Financing) or on other terms acceptable to Buyer so long as such definitive

 



63  agreements (A) do not contain any additional or modified conditions or other
contingencies to the funding of the Financing than those contained in the
Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement (and, if applicable in
the case of the Alternate Financing, only those conditions specified in the
Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement as being applicable to
the Alternate Financing), (B) are in a form that is otherwise not reasonably
likely to impair or delay the funding of the Financing or the Principal
Closing and (C) do not reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing set forth
in the Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement (or,
if applicable in the case of the Alternate Financing, reduce the aggregate
amount of Financing contemplated by the Alternate Financing Commitments as set
forth in the Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement), (ii)
satisfy, and cause its Subsidiaries to satisfy, on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Buyer or its Subsidiaries contained in the Financing
Commitments (or, if applicable in the case of the Alternate Financing, those
conditions contained in the Alternate Financing Commitments) and (iii)
consummate the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments (or the
Alternate Financing Commitments, if applicable) at the Principal Closing.
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, refrain from taking,
directly or indirectly, any action that is reasonably likely to result in the
failure of any of the conditions contained in the Financing Commitments (or
the Alternate Financing Commitments, if applicable) or in any definitive
agreement related to the Financing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Buyer shall not have drawn more than $600,000,000 under the
revolving credit facility under the Existing Credit Agreement (as defined in
the Financing Commitments) as of the Closing (without giving effect to any
amounts drawn to fund the Cash Consideration).

(b) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 6.06, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to
consummate the Transactions on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein are not conditioned upon the availability or consummation of the
Financing, the availability of any replacement commitments or receipt of the
proceeds therefrom and, accordingly, the parties hereto agree that a failure
of Buyer to close the Transactions due to the failure or inability
to consummate the Financing constitutes a breach of this Agreement.

(c) Buyer shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or other
modification of, or waive any of its rights under, any Financing Commitments
(or the Alternate Financing Commitments, if applicable) or the definitive
agreements relating to the Financing except (i) with Sellers prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, (ii) to
the extent such modification or waiver is not materially adverse to Seller or
(iii) to add additional Financing Sources who had not executed the Financing
Commitments as of the date hereof and amend the allocation of economics or
other related terms with respect to the existing and additional Financing
Sources, provided that, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), such amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver does not (A) reduce the aggregate amount
of any portion of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to
be paid or original issue discount as compared to the fees and original issue
discount contemplated by the Financing Commitments on the date hereof unless
the Financing is increased by a corresponding amount), (B) impose new or
additional conditions precedent to the availability of the Financing or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions precedent to the
Financing in a manner that could reasonably be expected to materially delay or
prevent the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the
Financing) at the Principal Closing or (C) adversely impact the ability
of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Financing Commitments (or the Alternate Financing Commitments)
or the definitive agreements with respect to the Financing.

 

(d) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including the "market flex" provisions) contained in the
Financing Commitments (or the Alternate Financing Commitments, if applicable),
Buyer shall promptly notify Seller, and Buyer shall, and shall cause its

 



64  Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, replacement commitments on
terms that will enable Buyer to consummate the Transactions and that are not
less favorable in the aggregate to Buyer than those contained in the Financing
Commitments; _provided_ that such replacement commitments shall not (i) be
subject to any additional or modified conditions or other contingencies to
the funding of the Financing other than those contained in the Financing
Commitments or (ii) otherwise be reasonably likely to impair or delay the
funding of the Financing or the Principal Closing. Buyer shall deliver to
Seller complete and correct copies of all amendments, supplements, other
modifications or agreements (including Redacted Fee Letters) pursuant to which
any amended, supplemented, modified or replacement commitments shall
provide Buyer with any portion of the Financing.

(e) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, and shall cause its and
their employees to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and shall
direct its and their accountants, legal counsel, other advisors and
representatives to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, all
cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer, including delivering to Buyer the Marketing
Financial Information and using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) deliver
to Buyer (A) the financial information described in  _Schedule 6.06(e)_ by
the dates indicated on _Schedule 6.06(e)_ and (B) by the date that is fifteen
(15) calendar days after the last day of each calendar month, a statement of
sales with respect to the Business on a monthly basis consistent with such
financial information previously provided to Buyer by Seller, (ii) upon
reasonable notice, cause Employees of the Business to participate in a
reasonable number of meetings and presentations with prospective lenders and
investors, and sessions with the ratings agencies contemplated by the
Financing Commitments, (iii) reasonably assist Buyer and the Financing Sources
in their preparation of (A) any bank information memoranda and related
lender presentations, and similar documents required in connection with the
Financing, and (B) materials for rating agency presentations ( _provided_ that
Buyer acknowledges and agrees that no such memoranda, documents, presentations
or other materials prepared in connection with the Financing may include any
report or opinion of Sellers independent auditors or otherwise include any
reference to Sellers independent auditors), (iv) reasonably assist Buyer in
connection with the preparation of any pledge and security documents and
other definitive financing documents as may be reasonably requested by Buyer
or the Financing Sources (including using reasonable best efforts to obtain
title and lien searches) and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging
of collateral and the granting of security interests in respect of the
Financing, (v) provide Buyer all documentation and other information with
respect to Seller and its Subsidiaries as shall have been reasonably
requested in writing by Buyer at least ten (10) business days prior to the
Principal Closing Date that is required in connection with the Financing by
U.S. regulatory authorities under applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-
money laundering rules and regulations, including the Patriot Act, to the
extent required under the Financing Commitments and applicable to Seller and
its Subsidiaries, and (vi) provide executed authorization letters to the
Financing Sources authorizing the distribution of information to prospective
lenders or investors and containing a

 



65  representation to the Financing Sources that the public side versions of
such documents, if any, do not include material non-public information
about Seller or its Subsidiaries or securities and executing ratings agency
engagement letters as required in connection with the Financing ( _provided_ ,
that Seller shall not be required to pay any cost or expenses relating to
rating agency engagement letters). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) such
requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of Seller and its Affiliates and (ii) in connection with such
requested cooperation, Seller and its Affiliates shall not be required to
provide any financial statements or financial information in respect of the
Business other than the Marketing Financial Information, and to use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Buyer (A) the financial
information described in _Schedule 6.06(e)_ by the dates indicated on
_Schedule 6.06(e)_ and (B) by that date that is fifteen (15) calendar days
after the last day of each calendar month, a statement of sales with respect
to the Business on a monthly basis consistent with such financial information
previously provided to Buyer by Seller. Buyer shall, promptly upon request by
Seller, reimburse Seller for all out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller or any
of its Affiliates in connection with such cooperation. In the event that Buyer
is provided with any report or opinion of Sellers independent auditors,
Buyer shall not provide such report or opinion or any portion thereof to any
of the Financing Sources unless such Financing Sources have executed and
delivered to Seller and Sellers independent auditors an acknowledgment
substantially in the form previously provided to Buyer. Buyer and its
Affiliates shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and its Affiliates from and against any Damages suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information
utilized in connection therewith. Seller shall have the right to consent to
the use of the Transferred Trademarks (but not any other trademarks or logos
of Seller or any of its Affiliates) in connection with the Financing (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ nothing in this sentence shall restrict Buyer from using Seller
trademarks in a descriptive manner to describe the Transactions.

 

(f) Buyer shall keep Seller informed on a timely basis of the status of the
Financing and any material developments relating to the Financing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall give Seller prompt
notice of (i) any default or breach (or any event that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach) by any party under the Financing Commitments (or any
Alternate Financing Commitment, if applicable) or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing of which Buyer becomes aware, (ii) any termination
of the Financing Commitments (or any Alternate Financing Commitment, if
applicable), (iii) the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Person party to a Financing Commitment (or any
Alternate Financing Commitment, if applicable) with respect to any (x) actual
or potential default, breach, termination or repudiation of any Financing
Commitment (or any Alternate Financing Commitment, if applicable), any
definitive agreement relating to the Financing or any provision of the
Financing Commitments (or the Alternate Financing Commitments, if
applicable), in each case by any party thereto, or (y) material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Commitment (or any
Alternate Financing Commitment, if applicable), with respect to the
obligation to fund the Financing, including any condition with respect to the
obligation to fund the Financing, or the amount of Financing to be funded at
the Principal Closing Date, and (iv) if for any reason Buyer believes in good
faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing

 



66  Commitments (or the Alternate Financing Commitments, if applicable). As soon
as reasonably practicable, and in any event, within two (2) business days
after the date Seller delivers to Buyer a written request, Buyer shall
provide any information reasonably requested by Seller relating to any
circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the immediately
preceding sentence.

 

(g) Buyer acknowledges that the information being provided to it in connection
with the Financing is subject to the terms of Section 6.05. With respect to
information disclosed to any rating agency (the " _Confidential_ ___Rating_
___Agency_ ___Information_ "), Buyer shall inform such rating agency of the
confidential nature of the Confidential Rating Agency Information and mark
any such information provided in writing to such rating agency as
"confidential". Buyer shall be responsible for any breach of this covenant by
any such rating agency.

 

SECTION 6.07. _Certain Financial Statements._ On or prior to the Principal
Closing Date, Seller shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Buyer the
2014/2015/2016 Audited Financial Statements and the Comparative Quarterly
Financial Statements. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts on and
after the Principal Closing Date to obtain a consent from Sellers auditors
to the filing of such financial statements in any public filing with the SEC
(it being understood that any costs incurred in obtaining any such consent is
paid by Buyer).

 

ARTICLE VII

_Post-Closing Covenants_

Seller covenants and agrees with Buyer and Buyer covenants and agrees with
Seller that during the period commencing after the Principal Closing:

SECTION 7.01. _Access._ Subject to customary confidentiality undertakings
comparable to those included in the Confidentiality Agreement, (a) to the
extent reasonably required for accounting, regulatory, compliance, litigation
or investigation purposes, or otherwise reasonably required by Seller (other
than in connection with a dispute, claim or litigation between Buyer and
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates), Buyer and its Affiliates will
permit Seller and its duly authorized representatives access during normal
business hours (upon twenty-four (24) hours written notice to Buyer) to all
contracts, books, records and other data relating to the Transferred Assets
and Assumed Liabilities conveyed and assumed at any Closing to the extent that
such materials were delivered to Buyer, except where such access
is prohibited by applicable Law and (b) to the extent reasonably required for
accounting, regulatory, compliance, litigation or investigation purposes, or
otherwise reasonably required by Buyer (other than in connection with a
dispute, claim or litigation between Buyer and Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates), Seller will permit Buyer and its representatives
access during normal business hours (upon twenty-four (24) hours written
notice to Seller) to all contracts, books, records and other data relating to
the Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities retained at any Closing to the
extent that such materials were retained by Seller and relate to the Business,
except where such access is 

 



67  prohibited by applicable Law. Seller agrees that after the Applicable
Closing, Buyer or its authorized representatives may, at Buyers cost and
expense, make copies of those books and records (or redacted portions
thereof) that have not been transferred to Buyer to the extent relating to the
Business.

SECTION 7.02.  _Insurance._ Except with respect to insurance proceeds that
constitute Transferred Assets pursuant to clause (xiii) of _Annex 2.02(a)_ ,
the coverage under all insurance policies related to the Business and arranged
or maintained by Seller or its Affiliates is only for the benefit of Seller
and its Affiliates, and not for the benefit of Buyer or the Business. As of
the Applicable Closing Date and consistent with Section 2.02(a), Buyer agrees
to arrange for its own insurance policies with respect to the Business
covering all periods following the Applicable Closing and, without prejudice
to any right to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, agrees not to seek, through any means, to benefit from
any of Sellers or its Affiliates insurance policies which may provide
coverage for claims relating in any way to the Business.

 

SECTION 7.03. _Payments from Third Parties._ In the event that, on or after
the Applicable Closing Date, either party shall receive any payments or other
funds due to the other pursuant to the terms of any of the Transaction
Documents, then the party receiving such funds shall promptly forward such
funds to the proper party. The parties acknowledge and agree there is no right
of offset regarding such payments and a party may not withhold funds received
from third parties for the account of the other party in the event there is a
dispute regarding any other issue under any of the Transaction Documents.

 

SECTION 7.04. _Assurances._ For a period of up to the later of (i) eighteen
(18) months after the Principal Closing Date and (ii) six (6) months after
any Applicable Closing Date, if either Buyer or Seller becomes aware that any
of the Transferred Assets has not been transferred to Buyer or that any of the
Excluded Assets has been transferred to Buyer, it shall promptly notify the
other and the parties hereto shall, as soon as reasonably practicable and,
subject to Section 2.02(g), ensure that such property is transferred, with any
necessary prior third-party consent or approval, to:

 

(a) Buyer, in the case of any Transferred Asset which was not transferred at
the Applicable Closing; or

 

(b) Seller, in the case of any Excluded Asset which was transferred at the
Applicable Closing.

 

SECTION 7.05. _Returned Goods._ For a period of 180 days after the Applicable
Closing Date, Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to adhere
to the returned goods policy set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 7.05_ with respect
to all Products of the Business received from customers, whether sold by Buyer
or Seller, to the extent any such returned Product has the name or trademark
of Seller or an Affiliate of Seller on it.

 



68 SECTION 7.06. _Tax Matters._ (a) _ Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns;
Payment of Taxes._ (i) Seller shall prepare all Tax Returns in respect of the
Transferred Assets or the Business for all Tax periods ending on or before the
Applicable Closing Date or that are due (including applicable extensions)
before the Applicable Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with past practice, except as required by applicable Law.
Seller shall also prepare (A) all Tax Returns that are required to be included
in (or filed with) a Tax Return of an affiliated, consolidated, combined,
unitary or aggregate group of which Seller or any of its Affiliates is part
for Pre-Closing Tax Periods and (B) any other income Tax Return of Seller or
any of its Affiliates. Any Tax Returns required to be prepared pursuant to
this Section 7.06(a)(i) shall be filed by Seller (except to the extent
prohibited under applicable Law, in which case they shall be timely filed, or
caused to be timely filed, by Buyer). With respect to any non-income Tax
Return in respect of the Transferred Assets or the Business for a Tax period
ending on or before the Applicable Closing Date that is filed after the
Applicable Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer, at least fifteen (15)
days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return (taking into account any
applicable extensions), or as soon as reasonably practicable in the event that
the due date for the filing of such Tax Return is less than fifteen (15) days
after the Applicable Closing Date, a copy of such Tax Return, together with
any additional information that Buyer may reasonably request. Buyer shall have
the right to review such Tax Return and additional information, if any, prior
to the filing of such Tax Return, and Seller shall consider in good faith any
reasonable comments submitted by Buyer at least five (5) days prior to the due
date of such Tax Return.

 

(ii) From and after the Applicable Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all other Tax Returns
(other than those relating to Transfer Taxes, such Tax Returns being addressed
by Section 2.06) required to be filed in respect of the Transferred Assets or
the Business. With respect to any Tax Return required to be filed by Buyer
with respect to a Straddle Period, Buyer shall deliver to Seller for its
approval, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for the filing of
such Tax Return (taking into account any applicable extensions), or as soon
as reasonably practicable in the event that the due date for the filing of
such Tax Return is less than fifteen (15) days after the Applicable Closing
Date, a statement setting forth the amount of Tax for which Seller is
responsible pursuant to Section 7.06(c)(i) and a copy of such Tax Return,
together with any additional information that Seller may reasonably request.
Seller shall have the right to review such Tax Return, statement and
additional information, if any, prior to the filing of such Tax Return, and
Buyer shall reflect on such Tax Return any reasonable comments submitted by
Seller at least five (5) days prior to the due date of such Tax Return. Any
Tax Return of a Selling Affiliate for a Tax period that would otherwise be a
Straddle Period shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be filed on
the basis that the relevant Tax period ended as of the close of business on
the Applicable Closing Date. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall
file an amended Tax Return or agree to any waiver or extension of the statute
of limitations relating to Taxes with respect to the Transferred Assets or the

 



69  Business for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period without the prior
written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that any failure by Seller to
consent to any such amendment, waiver or extension that would not reasonably
be expected to increase the liability of Seller or any of its Affiliates for
Taxes under this Agreement will be deemed unreasonable for purposes of this
Section 7.06(a)(ii).

(b) _Refunds._ Seller shall be entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment
from Buyer or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates with respect to (but net
of any cost to Buyer or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates attributable to the
obtaining and receipt of), any refund, credit, offset or other similar
benefit actually received or realized with respect to Taxes attributable to
the Transferred Assets or the Business for any Tax period ending on or before
the Applicable Closing Date, including any such amounts arising by reason of
amended Tax Returns filed after the Applicable Closing Date, but only to the
extent that such refund (or credit) does not relate to the Prepaid Tax Amount.
Buyer shall be entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment from Seller with
respect to (but net of any cost to Seller or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
attributable to the obtaining and receipt of), any refund, credit, offset or
other similar benefit actually received or realized with respect to Taxes
attributable to the Transferred Assets or the Business for a Tax period
beginning after the Applicable Closing Date. Buyer and Seller shall equitably
apportion any refund, credit, offset or other similar benefit received or
realized with respect to Taxes attributable to the Transferred Assets or the
Business for a Straddle Period in a manner consistent with the principles set
forth in Section 7.06(c)(vi).

(c) _Tax Indemnification._

(i) Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Buyer and its Affiliates harmless
from and against all liability for (A) any Taxes that are Excluded
Liabilities and (B) any Taxes that arise out of or result from (i) the breach
of any representation or warranty made by Seller in Section 3.18 of this
Agreement as if made on the Principal Closing Date (except as provided in
Section 7.06(c)(iii)) or (ii) the breach of any covenant, agreement or
obligation of Seller or its Affiliates set forth in this Agreement;

 

(ii) Seller shall not indemnify, defend or hold harmless Buyer or any of its
Affiliates from any liability for Taxes to the extent directly attributable
to (A) any election under any provision of the Code or foreign Tax Law
effective for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (and the costs attributable to any
such election shall be borne solely by Buyer), which election is made after
the Applicable Closing Date and is not expressly required by this Agreement or
(B) any other action taken or failure to act, in each case after the
Applicable Closing Date and outside of the ordinary course of business, by
Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any transferee of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, which action or failure to act, as the case may be, would
otherwise give rise to a Seller Tax indemnity obligation under this Section
7.06(c) or reduce any Tax asset of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, excluding
any such action or failure to act expressly required by this

 



70  Agreement, effected with the written consent of Seller or required by
applicable Law (including the filing of any Tax Return and any position
reflected thereon) (any action or failure to act covered by the immediately
preceding clause (A) or (B), a " _Buyer Tax Act_ ");

(B) Taxes of Seller and the Selling Affiliates for the Pre-Closing Tax Period,

71 (d) _Tax Contests._

 

(i) With respect to any Tax Proceeding relating to (A) a Pre-Closing Tax
Period (other than a Straddle Period), (B) any Taxes that are Excluded
Liabilities or (C) a consolidated Tax Return (of which Seller or any of its
Affiliates is a part), Seller may choose in its sole discretion (at its
expense) to control all proceedings and may make all decisions taken in
connection with such Tax Proceeding (including selection of counsel), and,
without limiting the foregoing, may, in its sole discretion, pursue or forego
any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences
with any Taxing Authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole
discretion, either pay the applicable Tax liability and sue for a refund or
contest the Tax at issue in such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any such Tax Proceeding
other than a Tax Proceeding described by clause (C), to the extent that such
Tax Proceeding could reasonably be expected to result in an indemnity
obligation of Buyer under Section 7.06(c) or otherwise have an adverse effect
on the Transferred Assets or the Business in a Post-Closing Tax Period, Buyer
shall have the right to participate in such Tax Proceeding (including
attending any conferences and having a reasonable opportunity to comment on
any written materials), and no settlement of such Tax Proceeding may occur
without the consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, with respect to any Tax Proceedings described above in clause (A), (B)
or (C) that Seller does not control, Seller shall have the right to
participate in such Tax Proceeding (including attending any conferences and
having a reasonable opportunity to comment on any written materials), and no
settlement of such Tax Proceeding may occur without the consent of Seller
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
With respect to any Tax Proceeding relating to a Straddle Period with respect
to the Transferred Assets or the Business, Buyer may choose in its sole
discretion (at its expense) to control all proceedings and may make all
decisions taken in connection with such Tax Proceeding (including selection
of counsel), and, without limiting the foregoing, may, in its sole discretion,
pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and
conferences with any Taxing Authority with respect thereto, and may, in its
sole discretion, either pay the applicable Tax liability and sue for a refund
or contest the Tax at issue in such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall have the right
to participate in such Tax Proceeding (including attending any conferences
and having a reasonable opportunity to comment on any written materials), and
no settlement of such Tax Proceeding may occur without the consent of Seller
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to any Tax
Proceeding relating to a Straddle Period described in the previous sentence 

 



72  that Buyer does not control, Buyer shall have the right to participate in
such Tax Proceeding (including attending any conferences and having a
reasonable opportunity to comment on any written materials), and no
settlement of such Tax Proceeding may occur without the consent of Buyer
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(ii) Except as otherwise provided herein, Buyer shall control all proceedings
with respect to Taxes relating solely to the Transferred Assets or the
Business, in each case, for any Post-Closing Tax Period.

 

(iii) Buyer and each of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller and its
Affiliates, on the other hand, shall cooperate in contesting any Tax
Proceeding, which cooperation shall include the retention and, upon request,
the provision to the requesting party of records and information, including
copies of any relevant Tax Returns and supporting work schedules, which
are reasonably relevant to such Tax Proceeding, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or
explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings
relating to such Tax Proceeding. Buyer and Seller shall execute and deliver
such powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the
intent of this Section 7.06(d).

 

(e) _Miscellaneous._

 

(i) Buyer shall not, and shall not cause or permit any Affiliate to, take any
action on the Applicable Closing Date other than in the ordinary course of
business if such action would have an adverse effect on Seller or any Selling
Affiliate with respect to Taxes, except as required by this Agreement or
applicable Law or with Sellers consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(ii) Each of Buyer and Seller shall provide the other with such information
and records, and make such of its officers, directors, employees and agents
available, as may reasonably be requested by such other party in connection
with the preparation of any Tax Return or the conduct of any Tax Proceeding
relating to the Transferred Assets or the Business for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or a Straddle Period. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Seller shall not be required to provide Buyer with a copy of, or otherwise
disclose the contents of, any consolidated Tax Return.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any claims for any and
all Tax matters shall be made only pursuant to, and the procedures with
respect thereto shall be governed exclusively by, this Section 7.06 and shall
not be governed by the provisions of Article X; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Sections 10.01, 10.07, 10.08 and 10.09 shall apply to such claims and
such procedures with respect thereto.

 



73 SECTION 7.07. _Ancillary Agreements._ As promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to date on which the Principal
Closing would otherwise occur, the parties shall negotiate in good faith, and
reasonably agree upon, a Reverse Transition Services Agreement addressing the
services set forth on  _Schedule 7.07_ and on terms substantially similar to
the terms of the draft Reverse Transition Services Agreement attached hereto
as _Exhibit I_ , except as otherwise provided in _Schedule 7.07_ and except
for such changes as are mutually and reasonably agreed by the parties (the "
_Reverse Transition Services Agreement_ "). It is the parties intent to so
agree within ninety (90) days after the date of this Agreement, and the
parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to do so. At the Principal
Closing, Buyer and Seller shall enter into, execute and deliver the Transition
Services Agreement, substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit G_ (the "
_Transition Services Agreement_ "), the Transition Manufacturing Services
Agreement, substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit H_ (the "
_Transition Manufacturing Services Agreement_ ") and the Reverse Transition
Services Agreement.

 

SECTION 7.08. _Bulk Transfer Laws._ Buyer acknowledges that Seller and the
Selling Affiliates have not taken, and do not intend to take, any action
required to comply with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws or
similar Laws of any jurisdiction. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller and
the Selling Affiliates with the provisions of any bulk sale or bulk transfer
Laws or similar Laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the Transactions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing acknowledgment and waiver shall
not be deemed to limit, waive, or otherwise modify the representations and
warranties of Seller set forth in Article III of this Agreement.

SECTION 7.09. _Other Transaction Matters._ Each of Seller and Buyer shall,
and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, comply with the applicable
obligations set forth on _Schedule 7.09_.

SECTION 7.10.  _Confidentiality._ Each of Seller and Buyer shall keep
confidential and shall not, and shall cause its respective Affiliates and its
and their respective representatives not to, directly or indirectly, from and
after the Applicable Closing Date, without the prior written consent of the
other party, disclose to any third party, any confidential or proprietary
information related to the Business (in the case of Seller) or Seller (in the
case of Buyer); _provided_ that the foregoing restriction shall not (i) apply
to information (A) which is or becomes generally available to the public other
than as a result of a disclosure in breach of this Section 7.10, (B) becomes
available to such party or its Affiliates on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than the Business or the other party or its Affiliates (
_provided_ , _however_ , such party reasonably believes, in good faith, that
such source was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other
contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the other
party or any other party with respect to such information) or (C) which has
been or becomes independently acquired or developed by such party or its
Affiliates or (ii) prohibit any disclosure (x) required by Law so long as, to
the extent legally permissible and feasible, such party provides the other
party with reasonable prior notice of such disclosure and a reasonable
opportunity to contest such disclosure or (y) made in connection with the
enforcement of

 



74  any right or remedy relating to this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Document or the Transactions. If, in the absence of a protective
order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, each of Seller or Buyer is, on
the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any confidential or proprietary
information related to the Business to any Governmental Entity, such party may
disclose such information to such Governmental Entity;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, at the reasonable request of the other party and at the other partys
expense, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will
be accorded to such portion of the information required to be disclosed as
the other party shall designate. From and after the Closing, each of Seller
and Buyer shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, enforce the
provisions, against the other party or parties thereto, of any
confidentiality agreement, non-disclosure agreement or other similar agreement
or instrument related to the Business (in the case of Seller) or Seller (in
the case of Buyer) to which such party or Affiliate of such party is a party.

SECTION 7.11. _Certain Post-Closing Financial Statements._ On or prior to the
date that is 120 days after the Principal Closing Date, Seller shall deliver,
or cause to be delivered, to Buyer the Comparative Q3 2017 and Q3 2016
Financial Statements. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain a consent from Sellers auditors to the filing of such financial
statements in any public filing with the SEC (it being understood that any
costs incurred in obtaining any such consent is paid by Buyer).

 

ARTICLE VIII

_Employees _

SECTION 8.01. _Employee Benefits Matters._ (a) From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Applicable Closing Date, Buyer shall provide Seller with
advance copies of, and shall consult with Seller and obtain Sellers consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
before distributing any communications to any Employee of the Business
whether relating to employee benefits, post-Closing terms of employment or
otherwise; _provided_ that this sentence shall not apply to (i) any
individual, non-commercial conversations or communications regarding matters
not covered by any of the Transaction Documents and not otherwise relating to
the Business or post-Closing employment of Employees of the Business or (ii)
any individual offer letter for a particular country that contains only
immaterial differences from a form offer letter for such country for which
Buyer and its Affiliates have previously complied with the requirements of
this Section 8.01(a) (including obtaining Sellers consent).

 

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and as soon as practicable after
the date of this Agreement (but in no event later than ten (10) business days
following the date hereof), Seller shall provide Buyer with a list on
_Schedule_ __ _ 8.01(b)_ containing an identification number, date of hire,
position, location, and base salary, wage rate and bonus opportunity (and, in
no event later than thirty (30) calendar days after the date of this
Agreement, for sales employees, sales incentive targets, as well as

 



75  actual sales incentives paid during the prior fiscal year), outstanding
equity awards (including vesting schedule and exercise price, as applicable),
expatriate status and any additional information that is necessary for Buyer
to establish payroll systems or employee benefit plans as of the Transfer
Time, as applicable, of each individual identified by Seller as expected to be
an Employee of the Business, and Seller shall update such information
periodically prior to the Applicable Closing Date to reflect new hires, leaves
of absence and employment terminations and any other material changes thereto
and provide copies of such updated lists and information to Buyer.

 

(c) In the event the employment of an Employee of the Business does not
automatically transfer to Buyer or its Affiliates upon the occurrence of the
Applicable Closing by operation of Law, (i) Seller shall take, or cause its
respective Affiliates to take, all actions required in accordance with
applicable Law in respect of the transfer of employment of such Employees of
the Business to Buyer or one of its Affiliates, and Seller shall encourage
each Employee of the Business to accept any offers of employment pursuant to
this Section 8.01(c) in its communications with such individuals; _provided_
that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall be interpreted as
requiring Seller or any of its subsidiaries to provide any such Employee of
the Business with any additional compensation or benefits or otherwise incur
any material liability; and (ii) not less than ten (10) business days prior
to the Applicable Closing, Buyer or one of its Affiliates will offer
employment, effective at 12:01 A.M., local time, on the day following the
Applicable Closing Date (the " _Transfer Time_ "), to such Employee of the
Business in accordance with this Agreement. Offers pursuant to this Section
8.01(c) shall (A) be for a position commensurate with the skills and
experience of such Employee of the Business and at a geographic work location
within fifty (50) miles of the applicable Employee of the Business primary
work location immediately prior to the Applicable Closing Date (or, to the
extent applicable in jurisdictions other than the United States, within such
lesser radius as is necessary to ensure severance is not due in connection
with such relocation); _provided_ that, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, Buyer may in its sole discretion provide that such geographic
work location shall be (on a permanent or temporary basis, as determined by
Buyer in its sole discretion) the home residence of such Employee of the
Business (a " _Home Relocation_ "); and (B) otherwise comply in all respects
with applicable Law (including with respect to compensation and benefits).
With respect to any Employee of the Business to whom Buyer or one of its
Affiliates is required to make an offer of employment pursuant to this Section
8.01(c), and who, as of the Applicable Closing Date, is on approved leave of
absence from work with Seller or its Affiliates (each, an " _Inactive
Employee_ "), Buyer shall offer employment to such individual on the earliest
practicable date following the return of such individual to work with Seller
and its Affiliates and otherwise on terms and conditions consistent with this
Section 8.01; _provided_ that such employee returns to work within 180 days
following the Applicable Closing Date or such later time as required by
applicable Law or the terms of any applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement
upon presenting themselves for duty to the Business. Seller shall promptly
notify Buyer of the occurrence and end of any such leave of absence. In the
case of any Inactive Employee who becomes a Transferred Employee following the
day following the Applicable Closing Date, all references in this Agreement to
(1) the day following the Applicable Closing Date shall be deemed to be

 



76  references to the date on which such individual becomes a Transferred
Employee and (2) the Transfer Time shall be deemed to be references to 12:01
A.M., local time, on the date that such individual becomes a Transferred
Employee. In any jurisdiction where the employment of an Employee of the
Business can transfer automatically to Buyer and its Affiliates upon the
occurrence of the Applicable Closing by operation of Law, (x) Buyer and
Seller agree to take, or cause their respective Affiliates to take, all
actions required under applicable Law and all other actions as are necessary
or appropriate such that the employment of such Employee of the Business
will transfer to Buyer or its Affiliates automatically as of the Transfer
Time and (y) in respect of Employees of the Business who are principally
employed in Mexico, such Employees of the Business will be transferred to
Buyer or one of its Affiliates as of the Applicable Closing Date through
"employer substitution mechanics."

(d) Buyer or its Affiliates shall bear all the liabilities, obligations and
costs relating to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the
Selling Affiliates from and against, any claims made by any Employee of the
Business for any statutory or common law severance or other separation
benefits, any contractual or other severance or separation benefits and any
other legally mandated payment obligations (including any compensation payable
during a mandatory termination notice period and any payments pursuant to
a Judgment of a court having jurisdiction over the parties hereto) and for
any other claim, cost, liability or obligation (whether related to
compensation, benefits or otherwise), in each case, arising out of (i) Buyers
breach of its obligations under this Article VIII or (ii) any claims for
severance or other separation benefits in connection with the involuntary
termination of employment by Buyer or its Affiliates of any Transferred
Employee on or after the Transfer Time (including any such termination that
occurs by reason of a Home Relocation). Seller or its Affiliates shall bear
all the liabilities, obligations and costs relating to, and shall indemnify
and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates from and against, any claims made
by any Employee of the Business for any statutory or common law severance or
other separation benefits, any contractual or other severance or separation
benefits and any other legally mandated payment obligations (including any
compensation payable during a mandatory termination notice period and any
payments pursuant to a Judgment of a court having jurisdiction over the
parties) and for any other claim, cost, liability or obligation (whether
related to compensation, benefits or otherwise), in each case, not arising
out of Buyers breach of its obligations under this Article VIII or under
clause (ii) above, including without limitation, any such claim arising out of
(x) the applicable Employee of the Business refusal to accept an offer of
employment made in compliance with this Article VIII from (or to commence
employment with), or objection to the automatic transfer of employment to,
Buyer or its Affiliates and (y) any claims made by any Employee of the
Business in PRC for any statutory severance or other separation benefits
(including statutory economic compensation and statutory compensation payable
in respect of accrued but not yet taken vacation days or other paid time off
for the calendar year in which the Applicable Closing Date occurs) that arise
as a result of any such employee who accepts an offer of employment from Buyer
or any of its Affiliates making a request that such severance or other
separation benefits be paid or provided by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.
Buyer shall not encourage any Employee of the Business regarding a

 



77  request described in the immediately preceding sentence, and in the event an
Employee of the Business asks Buyer a question regarding such request, Buyer
shall refer such Employee of the Business to an applicable representative of
Seller with respect to such request.

(e) With respect to U.S. Transferred Employees, during the Benefits
Continuation Period, Buyer or its Affiliates (i) shall provide to each
Transferred Employee (A) no less favorable base salary, wage rate and bonus
opportunities, as applicable, than as set forth on  _Schedule_ __ _ 8.01(b)_
and (B) employee benefits (other than defined benefit pension or retiree
medical and welfare benefits) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate,
than those in effect for such Transferred Employee as of immediately prior to
the Applicable Closing Date; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt,
Buyer may satisfy its obligations pursuant to this clause (i) by providing
cash payments or other benefits in lieu of equity compensation or other
benefits, and (ii) shall provide an office within a commute of no more than 50
miles from his or her office as of immediately prior to the Applicable Closing
Date; _provided_ that, Buyer may in its sole discretion provide for a Home
Relocation; _provided, further_ , that if a relocation beyond that distance or
a Home Relocation is required and such Transferred Employees employment
terminates as a result of his or her desire not to accept such a relocation,
such Transferred Employee shall receive the severance benefits at the level
set forth in Section 8.01(f). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contemplated by this Agreement shall be construed as requiring either Buyer or
any of its Affiliates to continue the employment of any U.S. Transferred
Employee for any period after the Applicable Closing Date; _provided_ that
such employee shall receive the severance benefits set forth in Section
8.01(f) if terminated under the circumstances described therein.

(f) With respect to U.S. Transferred Employees, during the Benefits
Continuation Period, in the event of a termination of any Transferred
Employees employment by Buyer or its Affiliates without cause (as reasonably
determined by Buyer or its Affiliates), Buyer or its Affiliates shall provide
severance benefits to each such Transferred Employee that are no less
favorable than those severance or termination benefits applicable to such
Transferred Employee as of immediately prior to the Applicable Closing Date;
_provided_ that such severance benefits shall be provided only if
the Transferred Employee timely executes (and does not revoke) a release of
claims in favor of Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer.

 

(g) With respect to U.S. Transferred Employees, effective from and after the
Transfer Time, Buyer or its Affiliates shall (i) recognize, for all purposes
(other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan) under all
plans, programs and arrangements established or maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates for the benefit of the Transferred Employees (the " _Buyer Plans_
"), service with Seller and the Selling Affiliates prior to the Transfer Time
to the extent such service was recognized under the corresponding Listed Plan
covering such Transferred Employees, including for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit levels and accruals, in each case, except
(x) where it would result in a duplication of benefits, or (y) with respect to
newly-established Buyer

 



78  Plans that do not provide credit for past service to similarly situated
employees of Buyer and its Affiliates, and in which at least a comparable
number of similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates (other
than the Transferred Employees or newly-hired employees) participate, (ii)
waive any pre-existing condition exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or
waiting period under all employee health and other welfare benefit plans
established or maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates for the benefit of the
Transferred Employees, except to the extent such pre-existing condition,
exclusion, requirement or waiting period would have applied to such individual
under the corresponding Listed Plan, and (iii) provide full credit for any co-
payments, deductibles or similar payments made or incurred prior to the
Transfer Time for the plan year in which the Applicable Closing occurs.

 

(h) If permitted by applicable Law, Seller shall pay to the Transferred
Employees (i) all accrued but unpaid vacation for periods prior to the
Transfer Time, and (ii) all base salary, wages, commissions or other amounts
(but not including any annual bonuses or incentives), in respect of services
performed by each Employee of the Business for Seller or its Affiliates, that
are earned and accrued but unpaid as of the Transfer Time, as applicable, in
each case, to be paid as soon as administratively practicable after the
Transfer Time or as required by applicable Law, but in no event later than
thirty (30) business days after the Transfer Time. If, under applicable Law,
Seller cannot pay the amounts described in the preceding sentence to
Transferred Employees, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for any such amounts that
Buyer pays to such Transferred Employees. Buyer will cooperate in good faith
with Transferred Employees with respect to vacation commitments purchased or
reserved by such Transferred Employees prior to the applicable Transfer Time
in respect of periods occurring subsequent to such applicable Transfer Time;
it being understood that any such vacation commitments ultimately honored by
Buyer shall count against the applicable Transferred Employees paid-time-off
accrued during his or her service with Buyer, or shall be unpaid.

(i) Subject to Seller providing all reasonably necessary support and
information in a timely manner, no later than the Applicable Closing Date,
Buyer shall establish or cause to be established (or utilize existing Buyer
Plans), at its own expense, all necessary retirement, pension, employee
welfare and employee benefit plans for Transferred Employees, as applicable.
Effective as of the Transfer Time, each Transferred Employee shall cease to be
an employee of Seller or the applicable Affiliate and shall cease to
participate in any Business Employee Benefit Plan (other than any
Assumed Benefit Plan) as an active employee. Other than with respect to a
government-sponsored benefit plan, Seller shall be, or shall cause its
Affiliates to be, responsible for all (i) medical, vision, dental and
prescription drug claims for expenses incurred by any Transferred Employee or
his or her dependents, (ii) claims for short-term and long-term disability
income benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee, and (iii) claims for
group life, travel and accident, and accidental death and dismemberment
insurance benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee, in each case, prior
to or as of the Transfer Time. Other than with respect to a government-
sponsored benefit plan, Buyer shall be, or shall cause its Affiliates to
be, responsible for all (A) medical, vision, dental and prescription drug
claims for expenses incurred by any Transferred Employee or his

 



79  or her dependents, (B) claims for short-term and long-term disability income
benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee, and (C) claims for group life,
travel and accident, and accidental death and dismemberment insurance
benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee, in each case, after the
Transfer Time. Except in the event of any claim for workers compensation
benefits, for purposes of this Agreement, the following claims and
liabilities shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (1) medical, vision,
dental and/or prescription drug benefits (including hospital expenses), upon
provision of the services, materials or supplies comprising any such
benefits and (2) short and long-term disability, life, accidental death and
dismemberment and business travel accident insurance benefits, upon the death,
illness, injury or accident giving rise to such benefits. Seller and its
Affiliates shall be responsible for all claims for workers compensation
benefits that are incurred prior to the Transfer Time by any Transferred
Employee. Buyer and its Affiliates shall be responsible for all claims for
workers compensation benefits that are incurred on or after the Transfer Time
by any Transferred Employee. A claim for workers compensation benefits shall
be deemed to be incurred when the event giving rise to the claim (the "
_Workers Compensation Event_ ") occurs.

 

(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8.01 to the contrary,
with respect to each Non-U.S. Transferred Employee, during the applicable
Benefits Continuation Period, or such longer period required by applicable
Law, Buyer or its Affiliates shall provide to such employee terms and
conditions of employment (including seniority and other service credit) that
individually, are no less than as required by applicable Law, and in the
aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided by Seller and its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Transfer Time and (ii) amounts (and, to
the extent required by applicable Law, types) of compensation and benefits
(including severance benefits and equity compensation benefits) that,
individually, are no less than as required by applicable Law and, in the
aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided by Seller and its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Transfer Time. For the avoidance of doubt,
Buyer may satisfy its obligations pursuant to the preceding sentence by
providing cash payments or other benefits in lieu of equity compensation or
other benefits (unless otherwise required by applicable Law). Without limiting
the generality of Section 8.01 or Buyers obligations hereunder, with respect
to Transferred Employees covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements,
effective from and after the Transfer Time, Buyer or one of its Affiliates
shall comply with applicable Law concerning Collective Bargaining Agreements
in the context of this Agreement.

 

(k) If any Employee of the Business requires a work permit or employment pass
or other legal or regulatory approval for his or her employment with Buyer or
its Affiliates, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such permit, pass or other
approval to be obtained and in effect prior to the Transfer Time (and Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use their commercially reasonable
efforts to transfer any such permit, pass or other approval to Buyer, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and to cooperate with Buyer or its
applicable Affiliate with respect to any ongoing approval process).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law or
any Collective Bargaining Agreement, in the event an applicable work permit
for an

 



80  Employee of the Business is not in place with Buyer or its Affiliate as of
the Transfer Time, such Employee of the Business shall be treated as an
Inactive Employee hereunder and the parties shall reasonably cooperate to
provide for the services of such Employee of the Business to be made available
exclusively to Buyer through an employee secondment, services or similar
arrangement under which Buyer shall be responsible for all the economic costs
of such individuals compensation and benefits (including reimbursement for
any expenses incurred by such Employee of the Business, all applicable fees,
Taxes and other amounts owed to third parties and all applicable social
or national insurance contributions) for such service period until the
applicable work permit can be obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, continue to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the applicable work permit.

(l) As of the Transfer Time, Seller shall provide to Buyer and its Affiliates
copies of all employment records for each Transferred Employee required to be
provided to Buyer and its Affiliates under applicable Law or as necessary for
Buyer to establish payroll systems or employee benefit plans as of the
Transfer Time. Seller shall be permitted to retain copies of such employment
records, except where prohibited by applicable Law. Buyer and its Affiliates
shall ensure that all such records are used only in connection with the
employment of such Transferred Employee or as otherwise permitted by
applicable Law.

(m) To the extent applicable, the parties hereto acknowledge the applicability
of the Transfer Regulations. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
they shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, comply with the
Transfer Regulations to the extent applicable.

 

(n) Seller and its Affiliates shall bear all the liabilities, costs and
obligations relating to any claim or potential claim that a benefit payable
to a Transferred Employee under any Business Employee Benefit Plan that is a
defined benefit plan in the United Kingdom has transferred to, and is a
liability of, Buyer or its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
all such liabilities, contingent or otherwise, that exist as of the
Applicable Closing Date).

(o) In the United States, pursuant to IRS Revenue Procedure 2004-53, Buyer and
Seller and their respective Affiliates shall apply the "standard" method for
purposes of employee payroll reporting with respect to any Employee of the
Business.

 

(p) The provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to any Employee of
the Business are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any right in any other person, including any
Employee of the Business (or dependent or beneficiary of any of the
foregoing). Nothing herein shall be deemed an amendment of any plan providing
benefits to any Employee of the Business.

(q) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, references to
the "Applicable Closing" and "Applicable Closing Date" in this Article VIII
and the defined terms used in this Article VIII shall be deemed to mean, with
respect to (i) any

 



81  Employee of the Business employed at the Raynham Facility who is dedicated
to a production line used to manufacture the Products (a " _Raynham Line
Employee_ "), the time and the date, respectively, of the Line Transfer of
such production line, and (ii) any other Employee of the Business employed at
the Raynham Facility (a " _Raynham Non-Line Employee_", together with the
Raynham Line Employees, the " _Raynham Employees_ "), the time and date as set
forth in _Schedule 8.01(q)(i)_ (a " _Non-Line Transfer_"), and in each case,
to the extent permitted by and in accordance with applicable Law. As soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement and in no event later than thirty
(30) days after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall provide _Schedule
8.01(q)(ii)_  (the " _Raynham Schedule_ ") which sets forth a true and
correct list, as of the date hereof, identifying each Raynham Employee by
employee identification number, position, the production line to which any
such Raynham Employee who is a Raynham Line Employee is dedicated and whether
such Raynham Employee is a Raynham Line Employee or Raynham Non-Line Employee.
Within thirty (30) Business Days prior to each Line Transfer or Non-Line
Transfer, Seller shall deliver to Buyer an updated Raynham Schedule, current
as of the date of delivery. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall make
offers of employment to each of the Raynham Employees in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)_ of the Agreement. In the event that a Line Transfer
or Non-Line Transfer does not occur, and the action or event causing such Line
Transfer or Non-Line Transfer to not occur is initiated, or occurs as a direct
result of a breach of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, by (x)
Seller, then, with respect to each Raynham Employee whose employment
is associated with the applicable production line or would have transferred
pursuant to such Line Transfer or Non-Line Transfer, as applicable, such
Raynham Employee shall no longer be considered an Employee of the Business
for all purposes of the Agreement and Seller may, but shall not be required
to, terminate such Raynham Employees employment and Seller or the Selling
Affiliates shall bear, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and
its Affiliates from and against, all the liabilities, obligations and costs
relating to such termination of employment or (y) Buyer, then, with respect to
each Raynham Employee whose employment is associated with the applicable
production line or would have transferred pursuant to such Line Transfer or
Non-Line Transfer, as applicable, such Raynham Employee shall no longer be
considered an Employee of the Business for all purposes of the Agreement
and Seller may, but shall not be required to, terminate such Raynham
Employees employment and Buyer or its Affiliates shall bear, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the Selling Affiliates from and
against, all the liabilities, obligations and costs relating to such
termination of employment.

SECTION 8.02. _Regulatory Approvals_. In furtherance of the covenants in
Section 6.05(e), in the event Buyer is obligated to effect any sale,
divestiture or disposition of any assets of the Business, the parties hereby
agree that (a) the parties shall cooperate to identify the Employees of
the Business whose employment is related to the assets of the Business
subject to the provisions of Section 6.05(d)(i) (the " _Divestiture Employees_
"), (b) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
employment of such Divestiture Employees shall not transfer to Buyer and its
Affiliates (whether by operation of law, pursuant to Section 8.01(c) or
otherwise) and, except as provided below, the Divestiture Employees shall not
become Transferred Employees for

 



82  purposes of this Agreement and (c) with respect to each Divestiture
Employee, prior to the Applicable Closing Date, the parties shall enter into
one or more agreements containing mutually acceptable terms and conditions
regarding the employment of, and the provision of services to Buyer and its
Affiliates by, any such Divestiture Employee, between the applicable Closing
Date and the consummation of any transaction(s) contemplated in Section
6.05(d)(i). With respect to the Divestiture Employees, Buyer agrees to provide
that, and Seller hereby agrees and acknowledges that Buyer and its Affiliates
shall have satisfied its obligations under this Article VIII in the
event that, a third party purchaser of the assets of the Business subject to
the provisions of Section 6.05(d)(i) shall make offers of employment to the
Divestiture Employees consistent with the covenants in Section 8.01 and
otherwise covenants to employ the Divestiture Employees consistent with
Section 8.01 as though (i) such purchaser were Buyer or its Affiliates under
Section 8.01, and (ii) the consummation of such transaction (or, if later, the
date on when a Divestiture Employee who is on an approved leave of absence
returns to work, consistent with the provisions in Section 8.01(c)) were the
Transfer Time hereunder, _mutatis mutandis_ (including provisions relating to
Transferred Employees);  _provided_ that, in the case of Section 8.01(h), the
"Transfer Time" shall mean the applicable Divestiture Employee Allocation
Time, and Buyer and its Affiliates shall be responsible for all such costs
until such Divestiture Employee transfers to the third party purchaser.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer or its
Affiliates shall bear all the liabilities, obligations and costs relating to,
and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the Selling Affiliates from
and against, any claims, costs, liabilities or obligations relating to any
Divestiture Employee that arise on or after the applicable Divestiture
Employee Allocation Time, excluding any such claims, costs, liabilities
or obligations (A) that Seller and its Affiliates would otherwise be
responsible for pursuant to the second to last sentence of Section 8.01(d) of
this Agreement and (B) that arise during the period beginning on the
applicable Divestiture Employee Allocation Time and ending with the
consummation of the transaction contemplated in Section 6.05(d)(i) that
relates to such Divestiture Employee from (I) any act or omission of Seller
and its Affiliates, in each case, in connection with the supervision,
management, direction, control or termination of the Divestiture Employees by
Seller or its Affiliates or any employee or agent of Seller or its Affiliates
(other than a Divestiture Employee) and where such act or omission was not in
compliance with applicable Law or the policies of Seller and its Affiliates,
(II) any act or omission of any Divestiture Employee, made or failed to be
made, as the case may be, at the request of Seller and its Affiliates or any
employee or agent of Seller or its Affiliates (other than a Divestiture
Employee) and where such act or omission was not in compliance with applicable
Law or the policies of Seller and its Affiliates, or (III) an act of fraud or
gross negligence by Seller or its Affiliates or an employee or agent of
Seller or its Affiliates (other than a Divestiture Employee).

 



83 ARTICLE IX

 

 _Termination_

SECTION 9.01. _Buyer Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated by Buyer:

(a) at any time prior to the Principal Closing, if (i) Seller shall have
failed to comply, in any material respect, with any of Sellers covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or (ii) any one or more of the
representations or warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement shall
prove to have been inaccurate, such that the conditions set forth in Section
5.01 would not be satisfied at the Principal Closing and, in each case, such
failure to comply or inaccuracy is not cured prior to the earlier of (1) the
Outside Date and (2) twenty (20) business days after written notice thereof is
delivered to Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that such twentieth (20th)
business day shall be extended (up to the Outside Date) so long as Seller is
using its commercially reasonable efforts to cure such failure to comply or
inaccuracy; or

(b) if the Principal Closing shall not have occurred on or before the Outside
Date; _provided_ that in the event that (i) the Comparative Quarterly
Financial Statements shall not have been delivered to Buyer prior to the
Outside Date and (ii) the conditions set forth in Section 5.01 have been
satisfied or waived, other than (x) with respect to the delivery of the
Comparative Quarterly Financial Statements and (y) the conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied by actions to be taken at the Principal
Closing, then the Outside Date shall be automatically extended until October
15, 2017;

_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Buyer may only terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the preceding clauses (a) or (b) if at the time of termination
Buyer is not in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement in a manner that would cause the
conditions in Section 5.02 not to be satisfied.

SECTION 9.02. _Seller Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated by
Seller:

(a) at any time prior to the Principal Closing, if (i) Buyer shall have
failed to comply, in any material respect, with any of Buyers covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or (ii) any one or more of the
representations or warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement shall
prove to have been inaccurate, such that the conditions set forth in Section
5.02 would not be satisfied at the Principal Closing and, in each case, such
failure to comply or inaccuracy is not cured prior to the earlier of (1)
the Outside Date and (2) twenty (20) business days after written notice
thereof is delivered to Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that such twentieth
(20th) business day shall be extended (up to the Outside Date) so long as
Buyer is using its commercially reasonable efforts to cure such failure to
comply or inaccuracy;

 



84 (b) if the Principal Closing shall not have occurred on or before the
Outside Date; _provided_ , that (i) in the event that (A) the Comparative
Quarterly Financial Statements shall not have been delivered to Buyer prior to
the Outside Date and (B) the conditions set forth in Section 5.01 have
been satisfied or waived, other than (x) with respect to the delivery of the
Comparative Quarterly Financial Statements and (y) the conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied by actions to be taken at the Principal
Closing, then the Outside Date shall be automatically extended until October
15, 2017 and (ii) in the event that the Marketing Period has not been
completed by the Outside Date, the Outside Date shall automatically be
extended until the second business day following the last day of the
Marketing Period; or

(c) at the Principal Closing, if (i) all of the conditions set forth in
Section 5.01 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Principal Closing) have been satisfied, (ii)
Seller has irrevocably confirmed in writing that (A) all of the conditions
set forth in Section 5.02 (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Principal Closing, provided such
conditions would have been satisfied as of such date) have been satisfied or,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waived by Seller, and (B) it is
prepared to consummate the Principal Closing, and (iii) Buyer fails to
consummate the Principal Closing within 3 business days following the date the
Principal Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.01(a);

_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller may only terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the preceding clauses (a), (b) or (c) if at the time of
termination Seller is not in breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement in a manner that would
cause the conditions in Section 5.01 not to be satisfied.

SECTION 9.03. _Effect of Termination._ (a) If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to this Article IX, subject to Section 9.03(b), it will become void
and of no further force and effect, with no liability on the part of any party
to this Agreement (or any of their respective former, current or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors,
officers, Affiliates or agents), except that the provisions of this Section
9.03 and Article XI will survive any termination of this Agreement; _provided_
, _however_ , except as set forth in this Section 9.03 that nothing herein
shall relieve any party from liability for Damages incurred or suffered by any
other party as a result of any fraud, willful misconduct or a knowing and
intentional material breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement.

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.02(c) and
Buyers failure to consummate the Principal Closing as described in Section
9.02(c)(iii) is the result of a Financing Failure, then Buyer shall promptly,
but in no event later than three business days after the date of such
termination, pay to Seller an amount equal to $60 million (the " _Termination
Fee_ ") by wire transfer of same day funds (it being understood that in no
event shall Buyer be required to pay the Termination Fee 

 



85  on more than one occasion). Solely for purposes of establishing the basis
for the amount thereof, and without in any way increasing the amount of the
Termination Fee or expanding the circumstances in which the Termination Fee
is to be paid, it is agreed that the Termination Fee is a liquidated damage,
and not a penalty.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, under the
circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable and is paid by Buyer,
Sellers sole and exclusive remedy against any member of the Buyer Group for
any damages or monetary remedy for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement shall be to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.02(c) and receive payment of the Termination Fee provided by
Section 9.03(b) and other amounts, if any, referenced in Section 9.03(d) and
expense reimbursement and indemnification from Buyer in accordance
with Section 6.06(e); _provided_ that the foregoing shall not relieve Buyer
from liability for any Damages incurred or suffered by Seller to the extent
arising from any fraud, willful misconduct or knowing and intentional material
breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement. Following the receipt of
the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.03(b) and other amounts, if any,
referenced in Section 9.03(d) and such expense reimbursement and
indemnification from Buyer in accordance with Section 6.06(e), no Person
shall have any rights or claims against Buyer or any member of the Buyer Group
under this Agreement, whether at law or equity, in contract in tort or
otherwise, and none of Buyer nor any member of the Buyer Group shall have any
liability or obligation to Seller or its Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not relieve
Buyer from liability for any Damages incurred or suffered by Seller to the
extent arising from any fraud, willful misconduct or a knowing and intentional
material breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that in the event of a Financing Failure,
Buyers failure to pay the Cash Consideration and other amounts to be paid to
Seller under this Agreement as a result of such Financing Failure, in and of
itself, shall not be deemed to constitute a knowing and intentional material
breach of this Agreement (except to the extent the Financing Failure has
arisen from Buyers knowing and intentional material breach of another
covenant of this Agreement). For the avoidance of doubt, while Seller may
pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 11.06
and the payment of the Termination Fee under Section 9.03(b), under no
circumstances shall Seller be permitted or entitled to receive both such grant
of specific performance and the Termination Fee (or any portion thereof).

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 9.03 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without
these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. If Buyer
fails promptly to pay the Termination Fee, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Seller commences an Action that results in a Judgment against Buyer
for the Termination Fee, Buyer shall pay to Seller, together with the
Termination Fee, interest on the Termination Fee from the date of termination
of this Agreement at a rate per annum equal to the rate per annum published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ from time to time as the prime lending rate
prevailing during any relevant period.

 



86 ARTICLE X

 

 _Indemnification_

SECTION 10.01. _Survival._ All representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement shall survive the Principal Closing until the date that is 18
months from the Principal Closing Date, and shall then expire and be of no
force or effect;  _provided_ , _however_ that (a) the Fundamental
Representations shall survive indefinitely, (b) the representations and
warranties contained in Section 3.18 (Taxes) shall survive until the date that
is thirty (30) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations and (c) the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.10 (Intellectual Property Rights) shall survive until the date that is two
(2) years from the Principal Closing Date. Any representation or warranty
that is the subject of any Claim with respect to which notice is delivered by
the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period set forth in this Section 10.01 shall survive with
respect to such Claim until such Claim is fully and finally resolved. The
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive
indefinitely.

 

SECTION 10.02. _Indemnification by Seller._ Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_
") against and from any and all Damages which any Buyer Indemnitee may incur
or suffer to the extent such Damages arise out of or result from (i) the
breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement as
if made on the Principal Closing Date, (ii) the breach of any covenant,
agreement or obligation of Seller or its Affiliates set forth in
this Agreement or (iii) any of the Excluded Liabilities. Notwithstanding that
a claim for Damages may fall into multiple categories of this Section 10.02, a
Buyer Indemnitee may recover such Damages one time only. Buyer shall take, and
shall cause the other Buyer Indemnitees to take, all commercially reasonable
steps to mitigate any Damages upon becoming aware of any event that would
reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto. This Section 10.02
shall not apply to Damages arising out of or as a result of Taxes.

SECTION 10.03. _Indemnification by Buyer._ In addition to the indemnification
set forth in Sections 6.05(e), 6.06(e), 7.06(c)(iv), 7.09, 8.01(d) and 8.02,
Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller against and from any and all
Damages which Seller and any of its Affiliates, and their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the
" _Seller Indemnitees_ ") may incur or suffer to the extent such Damages arise
out of or result from (i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by
Buyer in this Agreement as if made on the Principal Closing Date, (ii) the
breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation of Buyer or its Affiliates set
forth in this Agreement or (iii) any of the Assumed Liabilities.
Notwithstanding that a claim for Damages may fall into multiple categories of
this Section 10.03, a Seller Indemnitee may recover such Damages one time
only. Seller shall take, and shall cause the other Seller Indemnitees to take,
all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Damages upon becoming aware
of any event that would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto.
This Section 10.03 shall not apply to Damages arising out of or as a result of
Taxes.

 



87 SECTION 10.04. _Limitations on Liability._ (a) Except with respect to claims
related to breaches of Fundamental Representations or the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.18 (Taxes), indemnification shall be
available to the Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees under clause (i)
of Section 10.02 or clause (i) of Section 10.03 (as applicable) with respect
to breaches of representations or warranties only to the extent the aggregate
amount of Damages otherwise due to the Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller
Indemnitees, respectively, for all claims for such indemnification exceeds
$10,500,000 and then such indemnification shall be available to the Buyer
Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees, respectively, for the amount of all
such payments due to the Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees,
respectively, in excess of such amount, but only for all such Damages up to
$105,000,000. Except with respect to claims related to breaches of Fundamental
Representations or the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.18 (Taxes), Seller shall not have any liability under clause (i) of Section
10.02 with respect to breaches of representations or warranties for any
individual item or series of related items arising out of the same or similar
facts, events or circumstances where the Damages relating thereto are less
than $75,000. For the avoidance of doubt, limitations of the scope of Sellers
or Buyers liability under this Section 10.04(a) do not apply
to indemnification obligations available to Buyer Indemnitees under clauses
(ii) and (iii) of Section 10.02 or to Seller Indemnitees under clauses (ii)
and (iii) of Section 10.03.

 

(b) The amount of Damages resulting from any inaccuracy or breach of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall
be determined without references to the terms "material," "materially,"
"Material Adverse Effect," "material adverse effect" or other similar
qualifications as to materiality (including specific monetary thresholds)
contained or incorporated in any such representation or warranty, but such
qualifications, to the extent contained or incorporated in any such
representation or warranty, shall apply for the purposes of determining
whether any such inaccuracy or breach has occurred.

(c) The right of the Indemnitees to seek indemnification pursuant to this
Article X shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of the fact that,
based on any facts or circumstances known, or that should have been known, to
Seller, Buyer or any other Indemnitee, including from any investigation made
by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, the information provided in any
management presentation, the Data Room or given in writing to such Indemnitee
prior to the date of this Agreement (except, for the avoidance of doubt, any
disclosure of any fact or item in any portion to the Disclosure Letter), such
Indemnitee or any of its representatives knew or should have known that any
representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate.

 

SECTION 10.05. _Claims._ Any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee claiming it
may be entitled to indemnification under this Article X (the " _Indemnified_

 



88   __ _Party_ ") shall give prompt written notice to the other party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") of each matter, action, cause of action, claim,
demand, fact or other circumstances upon which a claim for indemnification (a
" _Claim_ ") hereunder may be based. Such notice shall contain, with respect
to each Claim, such facts and information as are then reasonably available,
including the estimated amount of Damages and the specific basis for
indemnification hereunder, to the extent known. Failure to give prompt notice
of a Claim hereunder shall not affect the Indemnifying Partys obligations
hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such
failure.

SECTION 10.06. _Defense of Actions._ The Indemnified Party shall permit
the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys option and expense,
within 30 days of the Indemnifying Partys receipt of notice of any Claim, to
assume the complete defense of any Claim based on any action, suit,
proceeding, claim, demand or assessment by any third party with full
authority to conduct such defense, through counsel reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, and to settle
or otherwise dispose of the same and the Indemnified Party will reasonably
cooperate in such defense; _provided_ the Indemnifying Party will not, in
defense of any such action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand or assessment,
except with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld), consent to the entry of any Judgment or
enter into any settlement (a) which provides for any relief other than the
payment of monetary damages for which Indemnifying Party is obligated to
indemnify Indemnified Party hereunder for the full amount of such damages,
(b) which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
third-party claimant to the Indemnified Party of a release from all liability
in respect thereof and/or (c) which includes any admission of wrongdoing or
misconduct by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the
defense of such action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand or assessment, in
accordance with this Section 10.06, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable to the Indemnified Party only for such legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof at the request of the Indemnifying Party and (ii) the Indemnifying
Party will afford the Indemnified Party an opportunity to participate in such
defense through counsel chosen by the Indemnified Party ( _provided_ that the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by such Indemnified Party)
and shall not enter into any settlement of such Claim for the payment of
monetary damages unless (A) the Indemnified Party consents in writing to such
settlement or (B) the Indemnifying Party confirms in writing to the
Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party will be responsible for
indemnifying the Indemnified Party for the Damages resulting from such Claim,
to the extent provided in (and subject to the parameters of) this Article X.
As to those third-party actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands or
assessments with respect to which the Indemnifying Party does not elect to
assume control of the defense, the Indemnified Party will afford the
Indemnifying Party an opportunity to participate in such defense, at its cost
and expense, and will consult with the Indemnifying Party prior to settling or
otherwise disposing of any of the same. The Indemnified Party will not settle
any Claim without the prior consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything in this Section
10.06 to the contrary, (x) the Indemnifying Party shall not be permitted to
assume the defense of any action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand or

 



89  assessment if (1) the Claim for indemnification relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal Action; (2) the claim seeks an injunction or
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party (other than an injunction or
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party that is incidental to monetary
damages as the primary relief sought); or (3) the amount of Damages suffered
or expected to be suffered with respect to such Claim has or would reasonably
be expected to result in Damages in excess of the amounts available for
indemnification pursuant to this Article X, and (y) the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ one separate co-counsel and to participate in
the defense in such action or proceeding, and the Indemnifying Party shall
bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel, if,
based on advice from counsel, there exists any actual or potential conflict
of interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in
connection with the defense of the third-party Claim. In any event, the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and their respective counsel
shall cooperate in the defense of any third-party Claim subject to this
Article X and keep each other informed of all significant developments
relating to any such third-party Claim, and provide copies of all
relevant correspondence and documentation relating thereto.

SECTION 10.07. _Limitation, Exclusivity, No Duplicate Recovery._ No Claim
for indemnification for a breach of any representation or warranty shall be
made or have any validity unless the Indemnified Party shall have given
written notice of such Claim to the Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration
of the applicable representation or warranty pursuant to Section 10.01. This
Article X, Section 6.05(e), Section 6.06(e), Section 7.06(c), Section 7.09,
Section 8.01(d), Section 8.01(q) and Section 8.02 provide the exclusive means
by which a party may assert and remedy claims for monetary relief pursuant to
this Agreement following the Principal Closing Date (other than disputes
related to the Consideration Adjustment Statement or purchase
consideration allocation, which shall be governed by the terms of Sections
2.04 and 2.05, respectively), including any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, and Section 11.13
provides the exclusive means by which a party may bring actions against the
other party under this Agreement. Each party hereby waives and releases any
other remedies or claims that it may have against the other party (or any of
its Affiliates) with respect to the matters arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement or relating to the Transferred Assets, except that any
limitations herein shall not apply (a) for the remedies of injunctive relief
or specific performance set forth herein; (b) in the event of fraud, as to
which the parties shall have all remedies available at Law or in equity; (c)
with respect to the covenants that by their respective terms anticipate
performance following the Applicable Closing Date; and (d) as otherwise
expressly provided in any Ancillary Agreements. With respect to any Damages
arising under this Agreement, (a) Buyer agrees that it shall only seek such
Damages from Seller and the Selling Affiliates, and Buyer hereby waives the
right to seek Damages from or equitable remedies, such as injunctive relief,
against any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Selling Affiliates) or any
director, officer or employee of Seller (or any of its Affiliates); _provided_
that such limitations shall not apply in connection with claims for successor
liability or fraudulent conveyance and (b) Seller agrees that it shall only
seek such Damages from Buyer, and Seller hereby waives the right to seek
Damages from or equitable remedies, such as injunctive relief, against any
Affiliate of Buyer or any

 



90  director, officer or employee of Buyer (or any of its Affiliates).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification under this
Article X or under Section 7.06(c) with respect to any matter to the extent
that such matter was reflected in the calculation of the adjustment to the
Cash Consideration, if any, pursuant to Section 2.04. 

SECTION 10.08. _Calculation of Damages._ Except as otherwise provided in this
Article X (or, in the case of any and all Tax matters, in Section 7.06(c)),
in any case where the Indemnified Party subsequently recovers from third
parties any amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an
Indemnifying Party has indemnified it pursuant to this Article X (or, in the
case of any and all Tax matters, to Section 7.06(c)), such Indemnified Party
shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered
(after deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by it in
procuring such recovery), but not in excess of any amount previously so paid
by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect

and the other Transaction Documents. Buyer is purchasing, and Seller is
selling to Buyer, the Transferred Assets based on the results of its
inspections and investigations, and the representations and warranties,
covenants and agreements made to the other party in the Transaction Documents,
and not on any representation or warranty of Seller or any of its Affiliates
not expressly set forth in the Transaction Documents.

 

SECTION 11.02. _Financial Information and Projections._ (a) In connection with
Buyers investigation of the Business, Buyer has received from the other
party various forward-looking statements regarding the Business (including the
estimates, assumptions, projections, forecasts and plans furnished to it) (the

Statements; (ii) Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties; and (iii) that
Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to any Forward-
Looking Statement.

SECTION 11.03. _To the Knowledge._ "To the knowledge of Seller" or other
references to the knowledge or awareness of Seller or its Affiliates means
the actual

 



91  knowledge of those individuals set forth on _Schedule 11.03(a)_. "To the
knowledge of Buyer" or other references to the knowledge or awareness of Buyer
or its Affiliates means the actual knowledge of those individuals set forth
on _Schedule 11.03(b)_.

SECTION 11.04. _Waivers._ At any time and from time to time prior to the
Applicable Closing, the parties hereto may by written agreement signed by both
parties, (a) extend the time for, or waive in whole or in part, the
performance of any obligation of any party hereto under this Agreement, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in any representation, warranty or statement of any party
hereto or (c) waive any condition or compliance with any covenant contained in
this Agreement. The failure of a party hereto to require performance of
any provision hereof at any time shall in no manner affect such partys right
at a later time to enforce such provision. No waiver in any one or more
instances shall be deemed to be a further or continuing waiver of any such
condition or breach in other instances or a waiver of any other condition or
breach of any other term, covenant, representation or warranty.

SECTION 11.05.  _Modifications and Amendments._ This Agreement shall not be
altered or otherwise amended except pursuant to an instrument in writing
executed and delivered by each of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, Sections 9.03, 11.06, 11.12 and 11.13 (and
any other provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, supplement,
waiver or other modification of such provision would modify the substance of
such Sections) and this Section 11.05 may not be amended, supplement, waived
or otherwise modified in any manner that is materially adverse in any respect
to the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing
Sources.

 

SECTION 11.06. _Assignability, Beneficiaries, Governing Law and Enforcement._

successors and permitted assigns, except that the Financing Sources shall be
express third party beneficiaries of Sections 9.03, 11.05, 11.12 and 11.13
and this Section 11.06, each of such Sections shall expressly inure to the
benefit of the Financing Sources and the Financing Sources shall be entitled
to rely on and enforce the provisions of such Sections. This Agreement
shall not be assignable by either party hereto without the express written
consent of the other party hereto, which will not be unreasonably withheld;
_provided_ that, without such consent, either Buyer or Seller may assign its
rights and obligations hereunder to an Affiliate of Buyer or Seller,
respectively (but no such assignment shall relieve such assigning party of its
obligations under this Agreement), at any time, or to a third party in
connection with a sale or transfer (by means of a merger, stock sale or
otherwise) of all or substantially all of Buyers business or Sellers
business, respectively. Other than as explicitly set forth herein, including
in Sections 10.02 and 10.03, nothing contained herein is intended to confer
upon any Person, other than the parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement. This Agreement shall be governed by the law of the State of
New York without reference to the choice of law doctrine of such state.

 



92 (b) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law if any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to Section
11.06(c), the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement without proof of actual damages, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in
equity. Each party further agrees that (i) no other party hereto or any other
Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this Section 11.06, and each party hereto irrevocably waives
any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument and (ii) it will not oppose the granting of
such remedy.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
explicitly agreed that Seller shall be entitled to seek specific performance
of Buyers obligations to cause the consummation of the Principal Closing only
in the event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied:

 

(i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 5.01 have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions
taken at the Principal Closing, _provided_ such conditions would have been
satisfied as of such date);

 

(ii) Buyer has failed to complete the Principal Closing on the date the
Principal Closing should have occurred in accordance with Section 2.01(a);

(iii) the Financing has been funded in accordance with the terms thereof or
will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Principal Closing;
