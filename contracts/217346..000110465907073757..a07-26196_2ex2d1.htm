 ** **

  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of

used and not otherwise defined in this Agreement have the meanings set forth
in ARTICLE X.

  



  

 **RECITALS**

  

 ** **

  

WHEREAS, it is proposed that Merger Sub shall commence a tender offer (as it
may be amended from time to time in accordance with this Agreement, the "
_Offer_ ") to purchase all of the outstanding shares (the " _Company Shares_
") of Company Common Stock (as defined herein), at a price of $81.00 per
share net to the seller in cash without interest (such amount, or
any different amount per share offered pursuant to the Offer in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "), on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, it is also proposed that, following the consummation of the Offer,
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company with the Company surviving as
a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger_ "), and each
Company Share that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer (other
than Company Shares held in the treasury of the Company or owned by Merger
Sub, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and other than Dissenting Shares) will thereupon
be canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal
to the Offer Price, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
have approved this Agreement and deem it advisable and in the best interests
of their respective stockholders to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS, as an inducement and condition to Parent entering into this
Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company are entering into a tender and
support agreement with Parent and Merger Sub simultaneously with the
execution of this Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ (the " _Tender and Support Agreement_ "), whereby, among other
things, such stockholders have agreed, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth therein, to tender the Company Shares held by them
in the Offer and support actions necessary to consummate the Merger;

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations and
warranties and mutual covenants contained in this Agreement and of other good
and valuable

  



        
   

  



  

consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, do hereby agree as
follows:

  



  

# ARTICLE I 
  
 THE OFFER

  



  

## 1.1 _The Offer_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated pursuant
to Section 9.1 and that none of the events set forth in paragraphs (a)
through (e) of _Annex I_  shall exist, as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement (and in any event no later than six Business Days
after the date of this Agreement), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act) the Offer. The Offer and the obligation of Merger Sub to, and of Parent
to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and pay for any Company Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to the condition that there
shall be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to
the scheduled expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended hereunder) and
not withdrawn, a number of Company Shares that, together with the Company
Shares then directly or indirectly owned by Parent, represents a majority of
all Fully Diluted Shares as of immediately prior to the expiration of the
Offer (as it may be extended pursuant to the terms of this Section 1.1(a))
**(** the " _Minimum Condition_ ") and to the other conditions set forth in
_Annex I_  (collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ "). Merger Sub expressly
reserves the right (but shall not be obligated) to waive any of the
conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of or conditions
to the Offer; _provided_  that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or
previously approved by the Company in writing, Merger Sub may not (i) waive
the Minimum Condition, unless the Modified Minimum Condition is satisfied and
Parent has made the Cash Election Request, (ii) change the form of
consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer, decrease the Offer Price or
the number of Company Shares sought in the Offer, impose conditions to the
Offer in addition to those set forth in _Annex I_ , or otherwise amend or
modify the Offer Conditions to the Offer in any manner materially adverse to
the holders of Company Shares, or (iii) extend the expiration date of the
Offer except as set forth in this Section 1.1(a). Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Offer shall initially expire at midnight,
New York City time, on the date that is 20 Business Days (for this purpose
calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after
the date that the Offer is commenced. Merger Sub shall extend the Offer on
one or more occasions for periods determined by Merger Sub of up to
20 Business Days per extension if, at the scheduled or extended expiration
date of the Offer, any of the conditions to the Offer shall not have been
satisfied or waived if in the reasonable determination of Parent such
conditions are capable of being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date;
_provided_ that (A) if all the Offer Conditions other than the Minimum
Condition are satisfied or waived as of the first scheduled expiration of the
initial offering period, then, unless (1) Merger Sub has previously commenced
a Notes Offer or (2) the Modified Minimum Condition is satisfied, Merger Sub
has waived the Minimum Condition and Parent has made the Cash Election
Request, then in the case of either subclause (1) or (2) of this clause (A),
Merger Sub shall be obligated to extend the Offer for an additional 10
Business Days, (B) if all the Offer Conditions other than the Minimum
Condition are satisfied or waived as of the

  



        
   

  



  

### scheduled or extended expiration of the Offer, then Merger Sub shall not
be obligated to extend the Offer unless required by applicable Law (but shall
be entitled to extend the Offer), and (C) if, at any scheduled or extended
expiration of the Offer, (1) the Offer Conditions set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of _Annex I_ have not been satisfied (other than by reason of a
judgment, injunction or order that is not final or remains subject to appeal)
or waived by Purchaser, (2) the Offer Condition set forth in paragraphs (c)
or (d) of _Annex I_ have not been satisfied or waived by Purchaser and, in
the case of clause (2), the breach or failure to perform or comply that has
caused such non-satisfaction is not capable of being cured within 20 days
after receipt by the Company of notice of such breach or failure from
Purchaser or, if capable of being cured within such period (it being
understood that a willful failure to comply with Section 7.5 shall be deemed
incapable of being cured), has not been cured within such period or (3) the
Offer Condition set forth in paragraph (e) of _Annex I_ has not
been satisfied or waived, then, in the case of any of subclause (1), (2) and
(3) of this Clause (C), Merger Sub shall not be obligated (but shall be
entitled) to extend the Offer; _provided_ , _further_ , that (x) Merger Sub
shall not, and shall not be required to, extend the Offer beyond the Outside
Date or (y) Merger Sub shall not be required (but shall be entitled) to
extend the Offer at any time that it is permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to ARTICLE IX. Following expiration of the Offer, Merger Sub may, in
its sole discretion, provide one or more subsequent offering periods (each, a
" _Subsequent Offering Period_ ") in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the
Exchange Act, if, as of the commencement of each such period, there shall not
have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and any
prior Subsequent Offering Period that number of Company Shares necessary to
permit the Merger to be effected without a meeting of stockholders of the
Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL. Subject to the
foregoing, including the requirements of Rule 14d-11, and upon the terms and
subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Merger Sub of the Offer Conditions
as of any scheduled or extended expiration of the Offer, Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and pay for, (A) as
promptly as practicable after the final expiration of the Offer, all Company
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and (B) as
promptly as practicable, all Company Shares validly tendered in any
Subsequent Offering Period. The Offer Price payable in respect of each
Company Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer or
validly tendered in any Subsequent Offering Period shall be paid net to the
holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction for any applicable withholding
Taxes.

  

### 

  

### (b) As soon as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ")
that shall include the summary term sheet required thereby and, as exhibits
or incorporated by reference thereto, the Offer to Purchase and forms of
letter of transmittal and summary advertisement, if any, in respect of the
Offer (collectively, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the
" _Offer Documents_ "), and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated
to holders of Company Shares. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent

## 

  

### (a) Effective upon the acceptance for payment of any Company Shares
pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Companys Board of
Directors that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the
Companys Board of Directors (giving effect to the election of any additional
directors pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)), and (ii) the percentage that the
number of Company Shares beneficially owned by Parent and/or Merger Sub
(including Company Shares accepted for payment) bears to the total number of
Company Shares outstanding, and the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause Parents designees to be elected or appointed to the
Companys Board of Directors, including increasing the number of directors,
and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors. At such time,
the Company shall promptly use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded
up to the next whole number, on (i) each committee of the Companys Board of
Directors and (ii) each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company
(and each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as such
individuals

  



        
   

  



  

### represent on the Companys Board of Directors, in each case, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the
Companys Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall
promptly take all actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such
information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors, as
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange Act require in order to fulfill
its obligations under this Section 1.3(b). Parent shall supply to the Company
in writing any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers,
directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 of the
Exchange Act.

  

### 

  

### (c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant
to Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of
the directors of the Company then in office who were not designated by Parent
(the " _Continuing Directors_ ") (or the approval of the sole Continuing
Director if there shall be only one Continuing Director) shall be required to
authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the
Companys Board of Directors and no other action on the part of the Company,
including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required
to authorize) any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any amendment
of this Agreement, including any decrease in or change of form of the Merger
Consideration, any extension of time for performance of any obligation or
action under this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, any waiver of compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement for the
benefit of the Company, and any amendment or change to Section 7.10;
_provided_ that if there shall be no Continuing Directors as a result of such
individuals deaths, disabilities, resignations or refusal to serve, then
such actions may be effected by a majority vote of the Companys Board of
Directors. Following the election or appointment of Parents designees
pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, any action by the
Company to enforce any obligation of Parent or Merger Sub under this
Agreement shall be effected only by the action of a majority of the
Continuing Directors (or the approval of the sole Continuing Director if
there shall be only one Continuing Director); _provided_  that if there shall
be no Continuing Directors as a result of such individuals deaths,
disabilities, resignations or refusal to serve, then such actions may be

### 

  

## 1.4 _Top Up Option_.

  

## 

  

### (a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to Merger Sub an option (the "
_Top Up Option_ "), exercisable upon the terms and conditions set forth in
this Section 1.4, to purchase that number of shares of Company Common Stock
(the " _Top Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of shares of
Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of Company Shares
directly or indirectly owned by Parent at the time of such exercise, shall
constitute one share more than 90% of the Fully Diluted Shares (after giving
effect to the issuance of the Top Up Option Shares) at a price per share
equal to the Offer Price; _provided_  that in no event shall the Top Up
Option be exercisable for a number of shares of Company Common Stock in
excess of the Companys then authorized and unissued shares of Company Common

  



        
   

  



  

### Stock (including as authorized and unissued shares of Company Common
Stock, for purposes of this Section 1.4, any shares held in the treasury of
the Company.)

  

### 

  

### (b) Merger Sub may exercise the Top Up Option, in whole or in part,
provided that upon exercise of the Top Up Option, Parent will directly or
indirectly own one share more than 90% of the Company Shares (after giving
effect to the issuance of the Top Up Option Shares), at any time after the
consummation of the Offer and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the
Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms. In the event that Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top Up Option,
it shall notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth in such notice:
(i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that will be owned by Parent
and Merger Sub immediately preceding the purchase of the Top Up Option
Shares, (ii) the number of Top Up Shares that Merger Sub intends to purchase
pursuant to the Top Up Option, and (iii) the place and time for the closing
of the purchase of the Top Up Option Shares by Merger Sub, which shall not be
more than five Business Days after delivery of such notice (the " _Top Up
Closing_ "). At the Top Up Closing, Parent or Merger Sub shall pay the
Company the aggregate purchase price for the Top Up Option Shares (calculated
by multiplying the number of such Top Up Option Shares by the Offer Price)
through the issuance of a promissory note, bearing simple interest at five
percent per annum and due on the first anniversary of the Top Up Closing for
the purchase price of such Top Up Option Shares, and the Company shall cause
to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing such Top Up Option
Shares.

  

### 

  

### (c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the shares of Company Common
Stock that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top Up Option will not
be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, or
will be upon the purchase of the Top Up Option Shares, an "accredited
investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act.
Merger Sub agrees that the Top Up Option and the Top Up Option Shares to be
acquired upon exercise of the Top Up Option are being and will be acquired by
Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of
the Securities Act).

# ARTICLE III 
  
 EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

  



  

3.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

  



        
   

  



  

### (a) _Conversion Generally_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(b), any shares of
Company Common Stock described in Section 3.1(e), or any shares of Company
Common Stock as to which appraisal rights are perfected pursuant to Section
3.1(f)) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal
to the Offer Price, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All
such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
such shares of Company Common Stock.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Parent-Owned Shares_. Except as otherwise provided in Section
3.1(e), all shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub or
any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist and no Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share,
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Change in Shares_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have
been changed into, or exchanged for, a different number of shares or a
different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, split, combination,
contribution or exchange of shares, the Offer Price and the Merger
Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to provide the holders of
Company Common Stock and Company Options, the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock
held in the Company treasury and each share of Company Common Stock, if any,
owned by any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain outstanding.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a stockholder who has not
voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has
properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration and the holders thereof shall be entitled
to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL, unless such
stockholder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such
stockholders right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such
stockholder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses such stockholders right
to appraisal, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they
had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
appraisal demands received by the Company, withdrawals thereof and any other
instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. Parent shall

  



        
   

  



  

### have the right, and the Company shall afford Parent the opportunity, to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any exercise (or
threatened exercise) of appraisal rights. The Company shall not settle, make
any payments with respect to or offer to settle any claim with respect to
Dissenting Shares without the written consent of Parent.

  

### 

  

## 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company
or another bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange, in accordance
with this ARTICLE III, through the Exchange Agent, the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 3.1(a) (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

  

### 

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event no more than three
Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate
(or certificates) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") (i) a
form of a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates,
together with such letter(s) of transmittal properly completed and duly
executed, to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificates. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed
and duly executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock may
be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of
Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that
any applicable transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon
such surrender, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration
issued upon conversion of a share of Company Common Stock in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such share of Company Common Stock.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation;

  



        
   

  



  

### _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion and no such investment or loss thereon shall
effect the amounts payable to the Companys stockholders pursuant to this
ARTICLE III. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered (including any interest received
and unpaid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect thereto) to
Parent, upon demand, and, from and after such delivery to Parent, any holders
of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE
III shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
general creditors thereof, for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
such shares of Company Common Stock, without any interest thereon.

  

### 

  

### (f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Company shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate.

  

### 

  

### (h) _Withholding_. Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts
as Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and
withhold under the Code, the Treasury Regulations or any other Tax Law, with
respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, such
deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger
Sub or the Exchange Agent.

  

### 

  

3.3 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and, thereafter, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as
otherwise provided in

  



        
   

  



  

this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted
into the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificates.

  



  

## 3.4 _Equity Awards_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and that is not then vested and exercisable,
shall become fully vested on an accelerated basis immediately prior to the
Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, each Company Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled in exchange for the right to receive from Parent or the Surviving
Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, a lump sum cash payment
(without interest), less applicable withholding Taxes, equal to the product
of (i) the excess if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the per
share exercise price for such Company Option and (ii) the total number of
shares underlying such Company Option (giving effect to the acceleration of
vesting contemplated by this Section 3.4). The Company shall ensure that
following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Option (or former holder
of a Company Option) or any participant in any Employment Benefit Plan shall
have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation or any other equity interest therein (including
"phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights).

  

### 

  

### (b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Companys Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee of the
Companys Board of Directors administering the Companys Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ")), shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other actions as may be required to provide that, with respect to the ESPP,
(i) participants may not increase their payroll deductions or purchase
elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement and (ii) cause
the ESPP to be suspended effective as of the later of: (A) a date that is no
later than fifteen days after the date of this Agreement or (B) a date that
is the last business day of the calendar month in which the date of this
Agreement occurs. Such suspension shall cause the "offering period" in effect
as of the date of this Agreement to be the final "offering period" under the
ESPP and subject to consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in the corresponding
section of the Company Disclosure Letter delivered to Parent and Merger Sub
by the Company concurrently with entering into this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ "), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub that:

  



  

4.1 _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware. The Company is

  



        
   

  



  

qualified to do business in every jurisdiction in which its ownership of
property or the conduct of its business as now conducted requires it to
qualify, except where the failure to be so qualified as a foreign corporation
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company is not in
violation of its restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws. The Company
has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the restated
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each as amended to date, of the
Company. Except as set forth in Section 4.1 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
the Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the

Board of Directors, held since January 1, 2004.

  



  

4.2 _Subsidiaries_. Section 4.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
true, complete and correct list of each Subsidiary of the Company, its place
and form of organization and each jurisdiction in which it is authorized to
do business. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or holds
the right to acquire any stock, partnership interest, membership interest,
joint venture interest or other equity ownership interest in any other
Person. Each Subsidiary is either wholly owned by the Company or a Subsidiary
or Subsidiaries of the Company, as indicated in Section 4.2 of the Company
Disclosure Letter. Except as set forth in Section 4.2 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, each outstanding share of capital stock of or other equity
interest in each of the Companys Subsidiaries is owned by the Company or a
Subsidiary, free and clear of any Liens, except Permitted Liens. None of the
Subsidiaries is in violation of its respective certificate of incorporation,

applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes
Oxley Act of 2002 (" _SOX_ ") and the rules and regulations thereunder, and
(ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company has no outstanding and unresolved comments from

or principles that would be required to be disclosed in the Companys
financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The disclosure in any report
filed by the Company after the date of this Agreement will not
differ materially adversely from the disclosure set forth in Section 4.6(f)
of the Company Disclosure Letter in so far as such disclosure, if any,
relates to the matters set forth in such Section 4.6(f) of the Company
Disclosure Letter. The books of account and other financial records of the

Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the
SEC)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract

Companys or such Subsidiarys published financial statements or the Company
SEC Reports.

###

to ensure that (i) all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and

  



        
   

  



  

### reported to the individuals responsible for preparing such reports within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and (ii) all
such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect
to such reports.

Company has been advised of, (i) any fact, circumstance or change that is
reasonably likely to result in a "significant deficiency" or a "material
weakness" (each as defined in PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5, as in effect on
the date of its adoption) in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting, or (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys
internal controls over financial reporting. Since the date of the filing of
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, there
have been no material changes in internal control over financial reporting.

  

### 

  

### (g) There are no liabilities or obligations of the Company or any of its

sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2007 or disclosed in the notes thereto
(the " _Current Balance Sheet_ "); (ii) any liability, including under any

## 

  

### (a) Set forth on Section 4.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter is a

compensation plan, employment or consulting, severance or termination pay,
holiday, vacation or other bonus plan or program, hospitalization or other
medical, life or other insurance, supplemental unemployment benefits, profit
sharing, pension, or retirement plan, program, agreement, commitment or

amended (" _ERISA_ "), maintained or contributed to or required to be
contributed to by Company or by any trade or business, whether or not
incorporated (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ "), that together with the Company would
be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA,
or to which the Company or an ERISA Affiliate is a party, whether written or
oral, for the benefit of any employee or former employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, excluding any plan, arrangement or program required
by the laws of a foreign jurisdiction.

  

### 

  

### (b) True and complete copies of the following documents have been made
available to Parent, if applicable: (i) each Employee Benefit Plan (including
all amendments and trust agreement or other funding vehicle related thereto),
(ii) the annual report filed on IRS Form 5500 and actuarial report or other
financial statement for the most recent plan year which is required for each
Employee Benefit Plan, and (iii) the most recent determination letter issued
by the Internal Revenue Service with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan
that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code.

  

### 

  

### (c) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect: (i) each
of the Employee Benefit Plans that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
and nothing has occurred that could be expected to result in the revocation
of such letter; (ii) the Employee Benefit Plans comply in form and in
operation in accordance with its terms and applicable Law, including but not
limited to the Code and ERISA; (iii) each of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has timely made all required contributions thereto; (iv) no
action has been asserted, instituted or, to the Companys knowledge,
threatened against any of the Employee Benefit Plans (other than routine
claims for benefits and appeals of such claims), and no Employee Benefit Plan
is under, and none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
any notice of, an audit or investigation by the Internal Revenue Service or
Department of Labor or any other applicable Governmental Entity; (v) no non-
exempt "prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the
Code and Section 406 of ERISA, has occurred or is expected to occur with
respect to any Employee Benefit Plan that could result in the imposition of a
Tax or penalty on the Company or its Subsidiaries under Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA; and (vi) no liability or
contingent liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred
by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full,
and no condition exists that presents a risk to the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate of incurring any such liability or contingent liability (other than
the payment of premiums under Section 4007 of ERISA).

  



        
   

  



  

### (d) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan that is subject to Section
302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code (" _Title IV Plans_ "),
the present value of accrued benefits under such plan, based on the actuarial
assumptions used for ongoing funding purposes in the most recent actuarial
report prepared by the plans actuary with respect to such plan did not
exceed, as of its latest valuation date, the then current value of assets of
such plan allocable to such accrued benefits.

  

### 

  

### (e) No Title IV Plan or any trust established thereunder has incurred any
"accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the
most recent fiscal year of each Title IV Plan prior to the Closing Date.

  

### 

  

### (f) Except as listed in Section 4.14(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
none of the Employee Benefit Plans provides for medical, dental or death
benefits beyond termination of service or retirement, other than (i) pursuant

qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

  

### 

  

### (g) None of the Employee Benefit Plans is a multiemployer plan within the

in Section 4.14(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (either alone or in combination with any subsequent
events) constitute an event under any Employee Benefit Plan that will or may
result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration
of payment, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in
benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee or
former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in which case will
or could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in
Section 4.14(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter, there is no contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement with an employee or former employee of the
Company to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the
date of this Agreement that, either individually or collectively and as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or in
combination with any subsequent events) would reasonably be expected to give
rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to
Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

  

### 

  

### (i) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, with
respect to each Employee Benefit Plan established or maintained outside of
the United States for the benefit of employees of the Company or any its
Subsidiaries residing outside the United States (each, a " _Foreign Plan_ "),
the fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Plan, the
liability of each insurer for any Foreign Plan funded through insurance or
the book reserve established for any Foreign Plan, together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit
obligations, as of the Effective Time, with respect to all current and former
participants in such plan according to the actuarial assumptions and
valuations most recently

  



        
   

  



  

### used to determine employer contributions to such Foreign Plan and no
transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or
insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations, and any and
all amounts required to be accrued with respect to any Foreign Plan
or pursuant to any statutory requirements pertaining to employee
benefits, mandatory contributions, retirement plans or similar benefits, have
been properly and timely accrued, including accruals relating to any
severance, termination pay or profit sharing benefits.

  

### 

  

### (j) On or prior to the date hereof, the Compensation Committee of the
Companys Board of Directors (the " _Compensation Committee_ ") has (i)
approved each Employee Benefit Plan or other arrangement, understanding or
agreement, and each amendment or supplement thereto or modification thereof,
pursuant to which any payments have been or are to be made or benefits have
been or are to be granted to any officer, director or employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Compensation Arrangements_
") as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d) under the 1934 Act and (ii)
taken all other action necessary to satisfy the requirements of the
nonexclusive safe harbor with respect to such Compensation Arrangements in
accordance to Rule 14d-10(d) under the 1934 Act (the approvals and actions
referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above, the " _Company Compensation
Approvals_ "). All payments made or to be made and benefits granted or to be
granted pursuant to such Compensation Arrangements (A) were, or will be, paid
or granted as compensation for past services performed, future services to be
performed, or future services to be refrained from being performed, by such
offer, director or employee and (B) were not, and will not, be calculated
based on the number of securities tendered or to be tendered in the Offer by
such director, officer or employee. The Companys Board of Directors has
determined that each of the members of the Compensation Committee are, and
the members of the Compensation Committee are, "independent directors" in
accordance with the requirements of Rule 14(d)-10(d)(2) under the Exchange

opinion from its financial advisor, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., (the "
_Company s Financial Advisor_") to the effect that, as of the date of this
Agreement, the Offer Price to be received by the holders of the Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the Merger Consideration to be
received

  



        
   

  



  

by the holders of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger is fair
from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock.

  



  

4.23 _Vote Required_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 5.9, the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to be
voted for the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Stockholder Approval_ ") is
the only vote of any class or series of the capital stock of the Company
required in connection with the consummation of the Merger.

  



  

4.24 _Takeover Statute_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of Parent in Section 5.9, the Companys Board of Directors has
taken all actions so that no restrictions contained in any "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition," "business combination," "fair price,"
"interested stockholder," "stockholder protection," or other similar anti-
takeover Law or regulation, including Section 203 of the DGCL (each, a "
_Takeover Statute_ "), and no restrictive provision of the
restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or of any
comparable organizational document of any of the Companys Subsidiaries, will
apply to Parent, Merger Sub, the execution or delivery of this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

provided after its execution to Parent) and (iv) the Companys Board of
Directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
would reasonably be likely to constitute a violation of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. Contemporaneously with furnishing any information to
such Person, the Company shall furnish such information to Parent (or, with
respect to any such information that has previously been furnished to Parent
or its Representatives, a list identifying such information).

Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with written notice of the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request,
discussion or inquiry, and the identity of the Person or group making such
Acquisition Proposal, request, discussion or inquiry, and a copy of all
written materials provided in connection with any such Acquisition Proposal,
request, discussion or inquiry. After receipt of such Acquisition Proposal,
request, discussion or inquiry, the Company shall promptly keep Parent
informed in all material respects of the status and details (including
changes or proposed changes to the economic terms and any other material
amendments or proposed material amendments and any withdrawals or
abandonment) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request, discussion or inquiry
and shall promptly provide to Parent a copy of all written materials
subsequently provided in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request,
discussion or inquiry.

  

### 

  

### (d) Neither the Companys Board of Directors nor any committee thereof
shall (i) fail to make the Board Recommendation, (ii) withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or publicly propose to withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Board Recommendation
(it being understood that, subject to Section 7.5(g), taking a neutral
position or no position with respect to any Acquisition Proposal shall be
considered an adverse modification), (iii) approve, recommend or otherwise
declare advisable, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, an
Acquisition Proposal (any of the actions described in the foregoing clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii), a " _Change of Recommendation_ ").

  

### 

  

### (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
subject, in the case of subsection (ii) below, to compliance with Sections
7.5(a), (b), (c) and (f), the Companys Board of Directors may, (i) make a
Change of Recommendation or (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1(e) prior to the first acceptance of Company Shares pursuant to the Offer
upon (A) the Companys substantially concurrent entry into a definitive
agreement for the consummation of a Superior Proposal and (B) payment by the
Company of the Company Termination Fee in accordance with the terms of
Section 9.2(b); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Companys Board of
Directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would
reasonably be likely to constitute a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

  

### 

  

### (f) The Companys Board of Directors shall not take an action described
in Section 7.5(e)(ii) unless (i) the Company promptly notifies Parent and
Merger Sub, in writing at least three Business Days before taking that
action, of its intention to do so in response to the

  



        
   

  



  

### receipt by the Company of a Superior Proposal, attaching the most current
version of any proposed agreement and a detailed summary of the material
terms of any such proposal and the identity of the offeror, and (ii) Parent
or Merger Sub does not make, within such three-Business-Day period, an offer
that is at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company, as
determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith (after
consultation with the Companys Financial Advisor), as such Superior Proposal
(it being understood that the Company shall not take any action described in
Section 7.5(e) during such three-Business-Day period, and that any amendment
to the economic terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new written notification from the Company and an additional three-
Business-Day period).

  

### 

  

### (g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Companys
Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act if the Companys Board
of Directors determines, after consultation with the Companys outside
legal counsel, that failure to so disclose such position would result in a
violation of applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
disclosure that (i) does not reaffirm the Board Recommendation, (ii)
with respect to any such disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal, goes
beyond a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (iii)
does not expressly reject such Acquisition Proposal, shall be deemed a Change
of Recommendation.

  

### 

  

## 7.6 _Regulatory Filings_.

  

## 

  

### (a) The parties shall cooperate with one another in determining whether
any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is
required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be
obtained from any parties to any Contracts or Government Contracts, in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each of the parties agrees
to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) obtaining all
necessary waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from
any Governmental Entity and the making of all necessary filings,
applications, notices or petitions and the taking of all reasonable steps as
may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or
proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (ii) obtaining all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties and (iii) defending any suits,
claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or enjoining, prohibiting,
preventing or restraining the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary
restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated,
reversed or lifted or seeking to have overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order that prohibits, prevents or restrains consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

### 

        
   

  



  

### (b) The parties shall as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date of this Agreement and in any event within 10 Business Days after the
date of this Agreement prepare and file all necessary documentation, effect
all necessary applications, notices, petitions and filings, including,
without limitation, (i) Notification and Report Forms with the United States
Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, as required under the HSR Act and (ii) notifications
as required under the ARC and the Cartel Act, and use all reasonable best
efforts to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act and to obtain the required approvals under the ARC
and the Cartel Act. The parties shall promptly supply each other with any
information which may be required in order to effectuate any such filing,
application, notice or petition. Each of the Company, Merger Sub and Parent
will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any comments from
any officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings
made pursuant hereto, and (ii) any request by any officials of any
Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any filing, application,
notice or petition made pursuant to, or information provided to comply in all
material respects with, any Law. Whenever any event occurs that is required
to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing, application,
notice or petition made pursuant to this Section 7.6(b), the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub, as the case may be, will promptly inform the others of such
occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Entity
such amendment or supplement. Except where prohibited by applicable Law, and
subject to Section 7.2, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
consult with the others prior to taking a position with respect to any such
filing, application, notice or petition, shall permit the other to review and
discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the others in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
white papers, arguments, opinions and proposals before making or submitting
any of the foregoing to any Governmental Entity by or on behalf of any party
hereto in connection with any investigations or proceedings in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including under
any antitrust Law), coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging
such information and promptly provide the others (and their counsel) with
copies of all filings, presentations or submissions (and a summary of any
oral presentations) made by such party with any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, _provided_ that with respect to any such filing, presentation or
submission, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub need not supply the
others (or their respective counsel) with copies (or in case of oral
presentations, a summary) to the extent that any applicable Law requires such
party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such
information. To the extent reasonably practicable, neither the Company,
Parent nor Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit their respective
Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or engage in any
substantive communication with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such
filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party prior
notice of such meeting or conversation and to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and the applicable Governmental Entity, without giving
the other parties the opportunity to attend or participate.

  

### 

  

### (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent
shall promptly use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of any
permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree,
decision, determination or judgment that would

  

### 

        
   

  



  

### delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the defense
through litigation on the merits of any claim asserted by any court, agency
or other proceeding by any Person or Governmental Entity, seeking to delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of such
transactions.

  

### 

  

7.7 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, subject
to applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the
other party of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would
be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect
the Offer and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement not to be satisfied, or (b) the failure of the Company or Parent,
as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement
that would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the
obligations of any party to effect the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.7
shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty, the failure to
comply with any covenant, the failure to meet any condition or otherwise
limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice.

  



  

7.8 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or other public announcement, or
scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors or
analysts, with respect to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement and shall
not issue any such press release prior to such consultation and approval,
except as may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement related
to the trading of the shares of either party on any securities exchange, in
which case the party proposing to issue such press release or make such
public announcement, or schedule a press conference or conference call with
investors or analysts, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consult
in good faith with the other party before issuing any such press release,
making any such public announcement, or scheduling any such press conference
or conference call with investors or analysts; _provided_ , _however_ , that
each of Parent and the Company may make any public statement in response to
specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending
industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any
such statements are not inconsistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company and
do not reveal non-public information regarding the other party.

  



  

## 7.9 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

  

## 

  

### (a) At all times after the acceptance for payment of any Company Shares
pursuant to the Offer, the Company (and from and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation) shall, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law and the Companys restated certificate of incorporation and
bylaws as of the date hereof, (i) indemnify and hold harmless, (A) each
present and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and (B) each employee named in Section 10.2(d) herein (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or

  

### 

        
   

  



  

### investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters or in connection with the fact that
such Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, or fiduciary of the
Company, or of another entity if such service was at the request or for the
benefit of the Company, for acts or omissions existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and (ii) advance expenses in the defense of any such proceeding as
incurred, _provided_ the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if a court of competent
jurisdiction determines, by final, nonappealable order, that such Indemnified
Party is not entitled to indemnification.

  

### 

  

### (b) For six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, cause to be maintained in effect for the
benefit of the Companys directors and officers an insurance and
indemnification policy with an insurer with a Standard and Poors rating of at
least A that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") covering each such person currently
covered by the officers and directors liability insurance policies of the
Company on terms with respect to coverage and in amounts no less favorable
than those of the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in
effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the
DandO Insurance in excess of 200% of the annual premium most recently paid by
the Company prior to the date hereof for such coverage (which amount is set
forth in Section 7.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the annual premiums for such insurance coverage exceed
200% of such annual premium, Parent shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Parent may satisfy
its obligations under this Section 7.9(b) by purchasing a "tail" policy from
an insurer with a Standard and Poors rating of at least A under the Companys
existing directors and officers insurance policy, which (i) has an
effective term of six years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers each person
currently covered by the Companys directors and officers insurance policy
in effect on the date of this Agreement for actions and omissions occurring
on or prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) contains terms that are no less
favorable than those of the Companys directors and officers insurance
policy in effect on the date of this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation shall, maintain in effect in the Surviving Corporations (or any
successors) certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions with respect
to indemnification and advancement of expenses, with respect to acts or
omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that are at least as
favorable to the present or former directors and officers of the Company as
those contained in the Companys restated certificate of incorporation and
bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement. The obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.9 shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom
this Section 7.9 applies without the express written consent of such affected
indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this
Section 7.9 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 7.9).

  

### 

        
   

  



  

### (d) The provisions of this Section 7.9 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have by contract or otherwise.

  

### 

  

### (e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, honor the indemnification and other
obligations set forth in this Section 7.9.

  

### 

  

## 7.10 _Employee Benefits_.

  

## 

  

### (a) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, all Employee Agreements, the
Change in Control Retention and Severance Plan, the MIP, the Incentive
Compensation Arrangements and all other Employee Benefit Plans in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time. In
addition, in connection with the MIP, Parent expressly agrees that it shall
calculate and pay the benefit awards payable to each employee participating
in the MIP with respect to the 2007 calendar year pursuant to the formula and
performance metrics as specified on Section 7.10(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter. Within ten days after the Effective Time, the Company shall provide a
cash payment to each employee participating in the Companys 2006 Long-Term
Incentive Plan in settlement of each such employees long-term incentive cash
award under such plan based on service through the Effective Time with the
names of each participant and corresponding target amount listed on Section
7.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  

### 

  

### (b) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to continue to honor the Labor Agreements
pursuant to the terms of such Labor Agreements.

  

### 

  

### (c) For the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending on December
31, 2008 (or such longer period as may be required under applicable Law),
Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to current and former
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries whose terms and conditions of
employment are not subject to a Labor Agreement (the " _Company Non-Union
Employees_ ") compensation and employee benefits (including, without
limitation, short and long-term incentive plans, 401(k) and pension plans and
health and welfare plans) that are, in the aggregate, substantially
comparable to those provided to the Company Non-Union Employees immediately
before the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , as of the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
honor the accrued but un-used vacation paid time off listed by individual as
of September 21, 2007, plus any additional amounts accrued through the
Effective Time, in Annex A to Section 7.10(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter for each Company Non-Union Employee and shall either (i) provide
vacation paid time off benefits to such employees during the period through
December 31, 2008 that are identical to the vacation paid time off benefits
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such employees as of the
Effective Time or (ii) pay out such benefits on or before

  

### 

        
   

  



  

### December 31, 2008, if the vacation time off is not taken by such date.
For the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending on the third
anniversary thereafter (" _Health Care Extension Period_ "), Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each individual listed in Section
7.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, group medical and dental care
coverage that is substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the coverage
provided to each such individual by the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time and with continued coverage under the same supplemental
policy listed in Section 7.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter ("
_Supplemental Policy_ ") in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time (together, the " _Health Care Arrangement_ "). Nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent the amendment or termination of a particular Employee
Benefit Plan (subject to applicable Law and the requirements of this Section
7.10);  _provided_ , _however_ , that, the Change in Control Retention
and Severance Plan and the Health Care Arrangement may not be amended or
terminated prior to the end of the Health Care Extension Period.

  

### 

  

### (d) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be provided, to
current and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries whose terms
and conditions of employment are subject to a Labor Agreement (the " _Company
Union Employees_ "), compensation and employee benefits in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Labor Agreement applicable to such employees
then in effect.

  

### 

  

### (e) For all purposes (other than benefit accrual but including accrual
under the vacation time off plans) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Non-Union Employees
after the Effective Time (collectively, the " _New Plans_ "), except as would
result in a duplication of benefits, each Company Non-Union Employee shall be
credited with all years of service and, as applicable, seniority status for
which such Company Non-Union Employee was credited before the Effective Time
under any similar Employee Benefit Plan. In addition and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Non-Union Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time or satisfaction
of any other eligibility requirements, in any and all New Plans to the extent
that (A) coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under an Employee
Benefit Plan in which such Company Non-Union Employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old
Plans_ ") and (B) such Company Non-Union Employee has satisfied all
applicable waiting time and other eligibility requirements of the Old Plan
that is being replaced by the New Plan; and (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Non-Union Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived
for such employee and his or her covered dependents, and any expenses
incurred by any Company Non-Union Employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken
into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

  



        
   

  



  

### (f) Prior to December 31, 2007 (or, in any event, prior to the Effective
Time), the Company shall amend all Employee Benefit Plans to the extent
required to avoid any penalties under Section 409A of the Code (each such
amendment, a " _409A Amendment_ ").

  

### 

  

7.11 _Facility Closings; Employee Layoffs_. For a period of 90 days after the
Closing Date, if Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall terminate any
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in such numbers as would
trigger any liability under the Worker Adjustment, Retraining and
Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2101, et seq. (" _WARN_ ") or any state plant
closing or severance law, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to comply with any notice or filing requirements under WARN
and any state plant closing or severance law.

  



  

7.12 _Takeover Laws_. The Company shall, upon the request of Parent or Merger
Sub, (i) take all reasonable steps to exclude the applicability to the Offer
or the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby of any Takeover
Statute, and (ii) assist in any challenge by Parent or Purchaser to the
validity, or the applicability to the Offer, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, of any Takeover Statute.

Company under the Indenture, and the Company shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments made by Parent, Merger Sub and their

Default (as such term is defined in the Indenture) or Event of Default (as
such term is defined in the Indenture) to occur prior to the Effective Time.
The Company shall promptly provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel with
(i) any communications, whether written or oral, that the Company or its

Company (i) shall elect to satisfy all or a portion of any Notes surrendered
for conversion after the first acceptance of Company Shares pursuant to the
Offer in cash and (ii) shall promptly notify the holders of the Notes and the
Trustee of such election in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. If
Parent makes such Cash Election Request, Parent shall lend or cause to be
lent to the Company funds sufficient to pay the Conversion Obligation (as
defined in the Indenture) that becomes due and payable under the Indenture in
connection with surrender of Notes for conversion by the holders thereof
after the first acceptance of Company Shares pursuant to the Offer, such loan
to be made at an interest rate equal to or less than the interest rate
payable under, and on terms substantially comparable to the terms of, the
Revolving Credit Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (d) At Parents sole option and discretion, Parent may cause Merger Sub
to commence a tender offer to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding
Notes (the " _Notes Offer_ ") upon such terms and conditions as Parent may
determine in its sole discretion. The Company hereby consents to the Notes
Offer and agrees to promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub in writing all
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries or the Notes that may
be required by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by Parent or Merger

respect. The Company shall promptly direct the Trustee to furnish Parent with

of securities positions of Notes held in depositaries, in each case as of the
most recent practicable date, and shall provide to, or cause the Trustee to

Offer.

  

### 

  

7.14 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to perform

purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

thereto, and the Company shall not enter into any settlement or compromise of
any such stockholder litigation without Parents and Merger Subs prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  



  

7.18 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any
party hereto and at such partys expense, any other party shall execute and
