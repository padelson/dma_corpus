NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises,

and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby make this Agreement and
prescribe the terms and conditions of the merger of TFC with and into ONB,
and the mode of carrying such merger into effect as follows:

ARTICLE I.

 

THE MERGER

1.01 _The Merger_. (a) _General Description_. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Article
IX hereof), TFC shall merge with and into and under the Articles of
Incorporation of ONB (the "Merger"). ONB shall survive the Merger (sometimes
hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue its
corporate existence under the laws of the State of Indiana pursuant to the
provisions of and with the effect provided in the Indiana Business
Corporation Law, as amended. (b) _Name, Officers and Directors_. The name of the Surviving Corporation
shall be "Old National Bancorp." Its principal office shall be located at One
Main Street, Evansville, Vanderburgh County, Indiana. The officers of ONB
serving at the Effective Time shall continue to serve as the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, until such time as their successors shall have been
duly elected and have qualified or until their earlier resignation, death or
removal from office. The directors of the Surviving Corporation following the
Effective Time shall be those individuals serving as directors of ONB at the
Effective Time until such time as their successors have been duly elected and
have qualified or until their earlier resignation, death, or removal as a
director.

 

(c) _Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws_. The Articles of Incorporation and
By-Laws of ONB in existence at the Effective Time shall remain the Articles
of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation following the
Effective Time, until such Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws shall be
further amended as provided by applicable law.

 

(d) _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the title to all assets,
real estate and other property owned by TFC shall vest in Surviving
Corporation as set forth in Indiana Code Section 23-1-40-6, as amended,
without reversion or impairment. At the Effective Time, all liabilities of TFC
shall be assumed by Surviving Corporation as set forth in Indiana
Code Section 23-1-40-6, as amended.

(e) _Integration_. At the Effective Time and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the parties hereto currently intend to
effectuate, or cause to be effectuated, the Merger, pursuant to Articles of
Merger, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit 1.01(e)(i)_,
and a Plan of Merger, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
1.01(e)(ii)_. The parties agree to cooperate and to take all reasonable
actions prior to or following the Effective Time, including executing all
requisite documentation, as may be reasonably necessary to effect the Merger.

1.02 _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure_. At ONBs election, the
Merger may alternatively be structured so that (a) TFC is merged with and
into any other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ONB or (b) any
direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ONB is merged with and into TFC;
provided, however, that no such change shall (x) alter or change the amount
or kind of the Merger Consideration (as hereinafter defined) or the treatment
of the holders of common stock, no par value, of TFC ("TFC Common Stock") or
options to purchase TFC Common Stock, (y) prevent the parties from obtaining
the opinions of counsel referred to in Sections 7.01(h) and 7.02(h) or
otherwise cause the transaction to fail to qualify for the tax treatment
described in Section 1.03, or (z) materially impede or delay consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event of such an
election, the parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment to this
Agreement (to the extent such amendment only changes the method of effecting
the business combination and does not substantively affect this Agreement or
the rights and obligations of the parties or their respective shareholders) in
order to reflect such election.

 

1.03 _Tax Free Reorganization_. ONB and TFC intend for the Merger to qualify
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) and related sections
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and that this
Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections
354 and 361 of the Code, and agree to cooperate and to take such actions as
may be reasonably necessary to assure such result.

 



2 1.04 _Absence of Control_. Subject to any specific provisions of the
Agreement, it is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that neither ONB
nor TFC by reason of this Agreement shall be deemed (until consummation of the
transactions contemplated here) to control, directly or indirectly, the other
party or any of its respective Subsidiaries (as such term is defined below)
and shall not exercise or be deemed to exercise, directly or indirectly, a
controlling influence over the management or policies of such other party or
any of its respective Subsidiaries.

 

1.05 _Bank Merger_. TFC and ONB agree to take all action necessary and
appropriate, including entering into a plan of merger (the "Bank Merger
Agreement") substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit 1.05_ , to
cause TBT to merge with and into Old National Bank (the "Bank Merger") in
accordance with the applicable laws and regulations effective simultaneous
with the consummation of the Merger. At the effective time of the Bank Merger,
the separate corporate existence of TBT will terminate. Old National Bank will
be the surviving bank and will continue its corporate existence under
applicable law. The articles of association Old National Bank, as then in
effect, will be the articles of association of the surviving bank, and the By-
Laws of Old National Bank, as then in effect, will be the By-Laws of
the surviving bank.

1.06 _No Dissenters  Rights_. Shareholders of TFC are not entitled to any
dissenters rights under Chapter 44 of the Indiana Business Corporation Law,
as amended, since TFC Common Stock is quoted and traded on the NASDAQ Global
Market. TFC shall take no action which would result in the loss of such
listing prior to the Effective Time.

 

ARTICLE II.

MANNER AND BASIS OF EXCHANGE OF STOCK

2.01 _Consideration_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, each share of TFC Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares
held as treasury stock of TFC and (ii) shares held directly or indirectly by
ONB, except shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in satisfaction of a debt
previously contracted, if any) shall become and be converted into the right to
receive in accordance with this Article:

 

(i) $6.75 cash (the "Cash Consideration"); and

 

(ii) 1.20 shares of common stock (the "Exchange Ratio") (as adjusted in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement), without par value, of ONB ("ONB
Common Stock").

The Cash Consideration and the Exchange Ratio are sometimes referred to herein
collectively as the "Merger Consideration."

(b) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase TFC common stock (an "TFC Stock Option") without any action on the
part of any holder thereof, shall be converted automatically into an option to
purchase a number of shares of common stock of ONB (each, an "ONB Stock
Option") equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest

 



3  whole share) of (A) the number of shares of TFC common stock subject to such
TFC Stock Option and (B) the sum of (x) Exchange Ratio plus (y) $6.75 divided
by (z) the Average ONB Closing Price (as defined below), at an exercise price
per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise
price of such TFC Stock Option divided by (B) the sum of (x) Exchange Ratio
plus (y) $6.75 divided by (z) the Average ONB Closing Price. Except as
specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each ONB Stock
Option will become fully vested, and shall otherwise continue to be governed
by the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the related TFC
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, ONB shall file an appropriate registration statement
with respect to the shares of ONB Common Stock subject to ONB Stock Options
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the
registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus
contained therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding.

(c) _Deferred Stock Units_. ONB and TFC shall take all requisite action so
that, at the Effective Time, each of the deferred stock units issued and
still outstanding under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (consisting 5,133
units) shall receive cash in the amount equal to the closing price of a share
of TFC Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing.

2.02 _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. At the Effective Time, the Exchange
Ratio shall be adjusted, if applicable, as follows (which Exchange Ratio, as
adjusted as provided below and in Section 2.05, shall become the "Exchange
Ratio" for purposes of this Agreement):

 

 _Shareholders  Equity_. If as of the end of the month prior to the Effective
Time, the TFC Consolidated Shareholders Equity (as defined in Section
7.01(m) hereof) is less than $61,117,844, the Exchange Ratio shall be
decreased to a quotient determined by dividing the Adjusted Stock Purchase
Price by the total number of shares of TFC Common Stock outstanding at
the Effective Time, and further dividing that number by the Average ONB
Closing Price.

As used in this Section 2.02, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated below:

" _Adjusted Stock Purchase Price_ " shall be equal to (x) the Stock
Purchase Price less (y) the difference between $61,117,844 and the TFC
Consolidated Shareholders Equity as of the end of the month prior to the
Effective Time.

 

 _"Average ONB Closing Price"_ shall mean the average of the per share closing
prices of a share on ONB Common Stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market
during the ten (10) trading days preceding the fifth (5th) calendar day
preceding the Effective Time.

 

" _Stock Purchase Price_ " shall be equal to the Exchange Ratio in effect at
the time of adjustment multiplied by the Average ONB Closing Price multiplied
by the total number of shares of TFC Common Stock outstanding as of the
Effective Time.

2.03 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, no fractional shares of ONB Common Stock and no certificates or
scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger; instead, ONB shall pay to each holder of TFC Common Stock who
otherwise would be entitled to a fractional share of ONB Common Stock an
amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying such fraction by
the by the Average ONB Closing Price.

 



4 2.04 _Exchange Procedures_. (a) At and after the Effective Time, each
certificate representing shares of TFC Common Stock shall represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

 

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, ONB shall reserve a sufficient number
of shares of ONB Common Stock to be issued as part of the
Merger Consideration. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
but in no event more than five business days thereafter, ONB shall mail to
each holder of TFC Common Stock a letter of transmittal providing instructions
as to the transmittal to ONB of certificates representing shares of TFC
Common Stock and the issuance of shares of ONB Common Stock in exchange
therefor pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 

(c) ONB shall cause (i) a check in the amount of cash that each holder of TFC
Common Stock has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(i), (ii) a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of ONB Common Stock that
each holder of TFC Common Stock has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.01(ii), and (iii) a check in the amount of any cash in lieu of fractional
shares or dividends or distributions which such holder shall be entitled to
receive, to be delivered to such shareholder upon delivery to ONB of
certificates representing such shares of TFC Common Stock
("Old Certificates") (or bond or other indemnity satisfactory to ONB if any
of such certificates are lost, stolen or destroyed) owned by such shareholder
accompanied by a properly completed and executed letter of transmittal, as in
the form and substance satisfactory to ONB. No interest will be paid on any
Merger Consideration that any such holder shall be entitled to receive
pursuant to this Article II upon such delivery.

 

(d) No dividends or other distributions on ONB Common Stock with a record date
occurring after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Old Certificate representing shares of TFC Common Stock
converted in the Merger into the right to receive shares of such ONB Common
Stock until the holder thereof surrenders such Old Certificates in accordance
with this Section 2.04. After becoming so entitled in accordance with this
Section 2.04, the record holder thereof also shall be entitled to receive any
such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of ONB Common Stock
such holder had the right to receive upon surrender of the Old Certificate.

(e) The stock transfer books of TFC shall be closed immediately upon the
Effective Time and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer records of TFC of any shares of TFC Common
Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Old Certificates are presented to ONB,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration deliverable
in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 2.04.

 

(f) ONB shall be entitled to rely upon TFCs stock transfer books to establish
the identity of those individuals, partnerships, corporations, trusts, joint
ventures, organizations or other entities (each, a "Person") entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive with respect
thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock
represented by any Old Certificate, ONB shall be entitled to deposit any
Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent third
party and thereafter be relieved from any and all liability with respect to
any claims thereto.

 



5 (g) If any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Old
Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed and, if required by ONB, the
posting by such Person of a bond or other indemnity satisfactory to ONB as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Old Certificate, ONB will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen, or
destroyed Old Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of TFC Common Stock that are held as treasury
stock of TFC or owned by ONB (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity
or in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted) shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist and no stock of TFC or other consideration shall be
exchanged therefor.

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party hereto shall be liable to any
former holder of TFC Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

2.05 _Anti-Dilution Adjustments_. If ONB changes (or establishes a record
date for changing) the number of shares of ONB Common Stock issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time by way of a stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization or similar transaction with respect to the
outstanding ONB Common Stock, and the record date therefor shall be prior to
the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted so the shareholders
of TFC at the Effective Time shall receive, in the aggregate, such number of
shares of ONB Common Stock representing the same percentage of outstanding
shares of ONB Common Stock as would have been represented by the number of
shares of ONB Common Stock the shareholders of TFC would have received if any
of the foregoing actions had not occurred. No adjustment shall be made under
this Section 2.05 solely as a result of ONB issuing additional shares of ONB
Common Stock provided it receives fair market value consideration for such
shares or such shares are issued in connection with the ONB Plans (as
hereinafter defined).

ARTICLE III.

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF TFC

 

On or prior to the date hereof, TFC has delivered to ONB a schedule (the "TFC
Disclosure Schedule") setting forth, among other things, items the disclosure

For the purpose of this Agreement, and in relation to TFC, a "Material
Adverse Effect" means any effect that (i) is material and adverse to the
results of operations, properties, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial
or otherwise), prospects, value or business of TFC and its 

 



6  Subsidiaries (as such term is defined below) taken as a whole, or (ii) would
materially impair the ability of TFC to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or otherwise materially threaten or materially impede the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed
to include the impact of (a) changes in banking and similar laws of general
applicability to banks or their holding companies or interpretations thereof

this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein, (e) the impact of the

compliance with this Agreement on the business, financial condition or results
of operations of TFC and its Subsidiaries, and (f) the occurrence of any
military or terrorist attack within the United States or any of its
possessions or offices; _provided_ , that in no event shall a change in the
trading price of the shares of TFC Common Stock, by itself, be considered to
constitute a Material Adverse Effect on TFC and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole (it being understood that the foregoing proviso shall not prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that any effect underlying such decline has
resulted in a Material Adverse Effect); and _provided_ , _further_ , that
without regard to any other provision of this Agreement, and without limiting
other events or circumstances that may constitute a "Material Adverse
Effect", a "Material Adverse Effect" shall be deemed to have occurred in the
event of the imposition of a formal regulatory enforcement action against TFC
or TBT following the date of this Agreement.

pollutants or storm water or process waste water or otherwise relating to the
environment, air, water, soil or toxic or hazardous substances or to the
manufacturing, recycling, handling, processing, distribution, use, generation,

grounds for any such claim, action or proceeding. No environmental clearances

has been in the chain of title or the operator or lessee, of any property on
which any substances have been used, stored, deposited, treated, recycled or
disposed of, which substances if known to be present on, at or under such
property would require clean-up, removal, treatment, abatement, response
costs, or any other remedial action under any Environmental Law. To TFCs
knowledge, neither TFC nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for any
clean-up or remediation under any of the Environmental Laws with respect to
any real property.

having a significant risk of uncollectability as of August 31, 2013, and a
list of Delinquent Loans as of August 31, 2013. The most recent loan watch

respects under the requirements of GAAP to provide for possible losses on
items for which reserves were made, on loans and leases outstanding and real
estate owned as of the respective dates.

(d) Except as set forth in the TFC Disclosure Schedule, none of the

ended June 30, 2013, and none of the investments made by any Subsidiary of TFC

pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its
business, other than those of general application that apply to similarly
situated bank holding companies or their subsidiaries, whether or not set
forth in the TFC Disclosure Schedule (a "TFC Regulatory Agreement"), nor has
TFC or any of its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2008, by any
regulatory agency or other governmental entity that it is
considering issuing, initiating, ordering, or requesting any such TFC
Regulatory Agreement.

 



23  There are no refunds or restitutions required to be paid as a result of any
criticism of any regulatory agency or body cited in any examination report of
TFC or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of an examination by any
regulatory agency or body, or set forth in any accountants or auditors
report to TFC or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

3.30 _Internal Controls_. (a) None of TFC or its Subsidiaries records,
systems, controls, data or information are recorded, stored, maintained,
operated or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by any means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) which (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct control of it or
its Subsidiaries or accountants except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a materially adverse effect on
the system of internal accounting controls described in the next sentence.
TFC and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

(b) TFC (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to TFC including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the
chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of TFC by others
within those entities, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to TFCs outside auditors and the audit
committee of TFCs Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect TFCs ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in TFCs internal controls over financial reporting. These
disclosures were made in writing by management to TFCs auditors and audit
committee and a copy has previously been made available to ONB. As of the date
hereof, there is no reason to believe that its outside auditors and its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 

(c) Since December 31, 2012, (i) through the date hereof, neither TFC nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of TFC or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that TFC or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged
in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing TFC or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by TFC
or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of
securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by TFC or any
of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of
TFC or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of TFC.

 



24 3.31 _Fiduciary Accounts_. TFC and each of its Subsidiaries has properly
administered in all material respects all accounts for which it acts as a
fiduciary, including but not limited to accounts for which it serves as a
trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or
investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents
and applicable laws and regulations. Neither TFC nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor any of their respective directors, officers or employees, has committed
any breach of trust to TFCs knowledge with respect to any fiduciary account
and the records for each such fiduciary account are true and correct and
accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.

 

3.32 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Board of Directors of TFC, at a duly
constituted and held meeting at which a quorum was present throughout, has
been informed orally by Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, a Stifel Company ("KBW"),
that the Merger Consideration is fair to TFC from a financial point of view.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ONB

 

On or prior to the date hereof, ONB has delivered to TFC a schedule (the "ONB

For the purpose of this Agreement, and in relation to ONB and its
Subsidiaries (as such term is defined below), a "Material Adverse Effect on
ONB" means any effect that (i) is material and adverse to the results of
operations, properties, assets, liabilities, condition (financial
or otherwise), prospects, value or business of ONB and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole, or (ii) would materially impair the ability of ONB to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or otherwise materially threaten or
materially impede the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that Material Adverse
Effect on ONB shall not be deemed to include the impact of (a) changes in

Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein, and (e) the occurrence of
any military or terrorist attack within the United States or any of its
possessions or offices; provided that in no event shall a change in the
trading price of the shares of ONB Common Stock, by itself, be considered to
constitute a Material Adverse Effect on ONB and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole (it being understood that the foregoing proviso shall not prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that any effect underlying such decline has
resulted in a Material Adverse Effect).

 



25 For the purpose of this Agreement, and in relation to ONB, "knowledge" means
those facts that are known or should have been known after due inquiry by the
directors and executive officers of ONB and its Subsidiaries. Additionally,

(c) Since June 30, 2013 on a consolidated basis ONB and its Subsidiaries have
not incurred any material liability other than in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice.

4.09 _Title to Properties_. Except as described in this Section 4.10 or the
ONB Disclosure Schedule, ONB or one of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,

(including, without limitation, all real property used as bank premises and
all other real estate owned) which is reflected in the ONB Financial
Statements as of September 30, 2011; good and marketable title to all personal
property reflected in the ONB Financial Statements as of September 30, 2011,
other than personal property disposed of in the ordinary course of business
since September 30, 2011; good and marketable title to or right to use by
valid and enforceable lease or contract all other properties and assets
(whether real or personal, tangible or intangible) which ONB or any of its
Subsidiaries purports to own or which ONB or any of its Subsidiaries uses in
its respective business and which are in either case material to its
respective business; good and marketable title to, or right to use by terms
of a valid and enforceable lease or contract, all other property used in its
respective business to the extent material thereto; and good and marketable
title to all material property and assets acquired and not disposed of or
leased since September 30, 2011. All of such properties and assets are owned
by ONB or its Subsidiaries free and clear of all land or conditional sales
contracts, mortgages, liens, pledges, restrictions, options, security,
interests, charges, claims, rights of third parties or encumbrances of any
nature except: (i) as set forth in the ONB Disclosure Schedule; (ii) as
specifically noted in reasonable detail in the ONB Financial Statements; (iii)
statutory liens for taxes not yet delinquent or being contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings; (iv) pledges or liens required to be granted in
connection with the acceptance of government deposits or granted in connection
with repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements; and (v) easements,
encumbrances and liens of record, imperfections of title and other limitations
which are not material in amounts to ONB on a consolidated basis and which do
not detract from the value or materially interfere with the present or
contemplated use of any of the properties subject thereto or otherwise
materially impair the use thereof for the purposes for which they are held or
used. All real property owned or, to ONBs knowledge, leased by ONB or
its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable zoning and land use laws. All real property, machinery, equipment,
furniture and fixtures owned or leased by ONB or its Subsidiaries that is
material to their respective businesses is structurally sound, in good
operating condition (ordinary wear and tear excepted) and has been and is
being maintained and repaired in the ordinary condition of business.

 

4.10 _Employee Benefit Plans_. With respect to the employee benefit plans, as
defined in Section 3(3) of the ERISA, sponsored or otherwise maintained by
ONB or any of its Subsidiaries which are intended to be tax-qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code (collectively, "ONB Plans"), all such ONB Plans
have, on a continuous basis since their adoption, been, in all material
respects, maintained in compliance with the requirements prescribed by all
applicable statutes, orders and governmental rules or regulations, including,

promulgated thereunder and the Code and Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder.

complete in all material respects; (b) paid or otherwise adequately reserved
in accordance with GAAP for all taxes, assessments and other governmental
charges due or claimed to be due upon it or any of its income, properties or
assets; and (c) not requested an extension of time for any such payments
(which extension is still in force). ONB has established, and shall establish
in the Subsequent ONB Financial Statements (as hereinafter defined), in
accordance with GAAP, a reserve for taxes in the ONB Financial Statements
adequate to cover all of ONBs and its Subsidiaries tax liabilities
(including, without limitation, income taxes, payroll taxes and withholding,
and franchise fees) for the periods then ending. Neither ONB nor any of its
Subsidiaries has, nor will any of them have, any liability for material taxes
of any nature for or with respect to the operation of its business, from the
date hereof up to and including the Effective Time, except to the extent set
forth in the Subsequent ONB Financial Statements (as hereinafter defined) or
as accrued or reserved for on the books and records of ONB or its
Subsidiaries, except as set forth on the ONB Disclosure Schedule. Except as
set forth on the ONB Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of ONB, neither
ONB nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently under audit by any state or
federal taxing authority. Except as set forth on the ONB Disclosure Schedule,
no federal, state or local tax returns of ONB or any of its Subsidiaries have
been audited by any taxing authority during the past five (5) years.

accrued for all current premiums and assessments with respect to such deposit
insurance.

4.13  _Insurance_. ONB has provided TFC with a list and, if requested, a
true, accurate and complete copy thereof, of all policies of insurance
(including, without limitation, bankers blanket bond, directors and
officers liability insurance, property and casualty insurance, group health
or hospitalization insurance and insurance providing benefits for employees)
owned or held by ONB or any of its Subsidiaries on the date hereof or with
respect to which ONB or any of its Subsidiaries pays any premiums. Each such
policy is in full force and effect and all premiums due thereon have been paid
when due.

 

4.14 _Books and Records_. The books and records of ONB are, in all material
respects, complete, correct and accurately reflect the basis for the
financial condition, results of operations, business, assets and capital of
ONB on a consolidated basis set forth in the ONB Financial Statements.

 

4.15 _Broker s, Finders or Other Fees_. Except for reasonable fees and
expenses of ONBs attorneys, accountants and investment bankers, all of which
shall be paid by ONB at or prior to the Effective Time, and except as set

on behalf of ONB or under any authority of ONB is or shall be 

 



31  entitled to any commission, brokers or finders fee or any other form of
compensation or payment from any of the parties hereto relating to this
Agreement and the Merger contemplated hereby.

4.16 _ONB Securities and Exchange Commission Filings_. ONB has filed all SEC
Reports required to be filed by it. All such SEC Reports were true, accurate
and complete in all material respects as of the dates of the SEC Reports, and
no such filings contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements, at the
time and in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
false or misleading. ONB has made available to TFC copies of all comment
letters received by ONB from the SEC since January 1, 2008, relating to
the SEC Reports, together with all written responses of ONB thereto. As of
the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in
such comment letters received by ONB, and to the knowledge of ONB, none of the
SEC Reports is the subject of any ongoing review by the SEC.

4.17 _Community Reinvestment Act_. Old National Bank received a rating
of "satisfactory" or better in its most recent examination or interim review
with respect to the Community Reinvestment Act.

constituting a capital investment in excess of $100,000 individually or

interest or encumbrance, except for tax and other liens which arise by

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on TFC.

 

5.04 _Insurance_. TFC and its Subsidiaries shall maintain, or cause to be
maintained, in full force and effect, insurance on its assets, properties and
operations, fidelity coverage and directors and officers liability insurance
in such amounts and with regard to such liabilities and hazards as are
currently insured by TFC or its Subsidiaries as of the date of this
Agreement.

5.05 _Accruals for Loan Loss Reserve and Expenses_. (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, TFC shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to make, consistent with
GAAP, the rules and regulations of the SEC and applicable banking laws and
regulations, such appropriate accounting

 



36  entries in its books and records and use commercially reasonable efforts to
take such other actions as TFC and its Subsidiaries shall deem to be necessary
or desirable in anticipation of the Merger including, without limitation,
accruals or the creation of reserves for employee benefits and Merger-related
expenses.

(b) TFC recognizes that ONB may have adopted different loan and accounting
policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of loan loss
allowances). Subject to applicable law (including without limitation the rules
and regulations of the SEC, U.S Department of Justice and Federal Trade
Commission guidelines regarding pre-merger information exchange between
competitors (the "Guidelines"), applicable banking laws and regulations and
GAAP), and in a manner that is not inconsistent with TFCs need to operate
its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practices, from and
after the date hereof TFC shall consult and cooperate in good faith with ONB
with respect to conforming the loan and accounting policies and practices of
TFC to those policies and practices of ONB for financial accounting and/or
income tax reporting purposes, as reasonably specified in each case in writing
from ONB to TFC, based upon such consultation and subject to the conditions
in Section 5.05(d).

(c) Subject to applicable law (including without limitation the rules and
regulations of the SEC, applicable banking laws and regulations and GAAP),
TFC shall consult and cooperate in good faith with ONB with respect to
determining, as reasonably specified in a written notice from ONB to TFC,
based upon such consultation and subject to the conditions in Section
5.05(d), the amount and the timing for recognizing for financial accounting
and/or income tax reporting purposes of TFCs expenses of the Merger.

 

(d) Subject to applicable law (including without limitation the rules and
regulations of the SEC, applicable banking laws and regulations and GAAP),
TFC shall consult and cooperate in good faith to (i) make such conforming
entries to conform the loan and accounting policies and practices of TFC to
the policies and practices of ONB as contemplated in Section 5.05(b) above
and (ii) recognize TFCs expenses of the Merger for financial accounting
and/or income tax reporting purposes at such times as are reasonably requested
in writing by ONB as contemplated in Section 5.05(c) above, but in no event
prior to the 5th day next preceding the Closing Date and only after ONB
acknowledges that all conditions to its obligation to consummate the Merger
have been satisfied and certifies to TFC that ONB will at the Effective Time
deliver to TFC the certificate contemplated in Section 7.02(g).

(e) TFCs representations, warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement shall not be deemed to be untrue or breached in any respect for any
purpose as a consequence of any modifications or changes undertaken on account
of Section 5.05(d).

 

5.06 _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) TFC will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, and its and their respective officers, directors and
representatives (including KBW) to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any
Person that has made or indicated an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal
(as defined below). During the period from the date of this Agreement through
the Effective Time, TFC shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any
material provision of any confidentiality or similar agreement to which TFC or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party (other than any involving ONB).

 



37 (b) Except as permitted in this Section 5.06, TFC shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and any of their respective directors, officers and
representatives (including KBW) not to, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage or facilitate, or take any other action designed to, or that could
reasonably be expected to facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-
public information) any inquiries with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or
(ii) initiate, participate in or knowingly encourage any discussions or
negotiations or otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way with any Person
regarding an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that, at any time prior
to obtaining the approval of the Merger by TFCs shareholders, if TFC receives
a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the TFC Board of Directors determines
in good faith constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal (as defined below) that was not solicited after the date
hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of TFCs obligations
under this Section 5.06, TFC may furnish, or cause to be furnished, non-
public information with respect to TFC and its Subsidiaries to the Person who
made such proposal (provided that all such information has been provided to
ONB prior to or at the same time it is provided to such Person) and may
participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such proposal if (A) the
TFC Board of Directors determines in good faith, and following consultation
with financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to do so
would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to
TFCs shareholders under applicable law and (B) prior to taking such action,
TFC has used its best reasonable efforts to enter into a confidentiality
agreement with respect to such proposal that contains a standstill agreement
on customary terms. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions contained in the first sentence of this Section
5.06 by any representative (including KBW) of TFC or its Subsidiaries shall be
a breach of this Section 5.06 by TFC.

 

(c) Neither the TFC Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (or
shall agree or resolve to) (i) fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to ONB or propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to ONB (or
take any action inconsistent with) the recommendation by such TFC Board of
Directors or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger, or
approve or recommend, or propose to recommend, the approval or recommendation
of any Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing being referred to herein as
an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), or (ii) cause or permit TFC or TBT to
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an
"Acquisition Agreement") constituting or related to, or which is intended to
or would be reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than
a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.06(b)). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, at any time prior to the special meeting of TFCs shareholders
to approve the Merger, the TFC Board of Directors may, in response to a
Superior Proposal, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change; provided, that the
TFC Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to do so would
be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of TFC under applicable Law, and provided, further, that the TFC
Board of Directors may not effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change unless
(A) the TFC Board shall have first provided prior written notice to ONB (an
"Adverse Recommendation Change Notice") that it is prepared to effect an
Adverse Recommendation

 



38  Change in response to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall, in the case
of a Superior Proposal, attach the most current version of any proposed
written agreement or letter of intent relating to the transaction that
constitutes such Superior Proposal (it being understood that any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new notice and a new five business day period) and (ii) ONB does
not make, within five business days after receipt of such notice, a proposal
that would, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the TFC Board of
Directors (after consultation with financial advisors and outside legal
counsel), cause the offer previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no
longer constitute a Superior Proposal or that the Adverse Recommendation
Change is no longer required to comply with the TFC Boards fiduciary duties
to the shareholders of TFC under applicable law. TFC agrees that, during the
five business day period prior to its effecting an Adverse Recommendation
Change, TFC and its officers, directors and representatives shall negotiate in
good faith with ONB and its officers, directors, and representatives
regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement proposed by ONB.

 

(d) In addition to the obligations of TFC set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and
(c) of this Section 5.06, TFC shall as promptly as possible, and in any event
within two business days after TFC first obtains knowledge of the receipt
thereof, advise ONB orally and in writing of (i) any Acquisition Proposal or
any request for information that TFC reasonably believes could lead to or
contemplates an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any inquiry TFC reasonably
believes could lead to any Acquisition Proposal, the terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including any subsequent
amendment or other modification to such terms and conditions) and the
identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal or request or
inquiry. In connection with any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry,
if there occurs or is presented to TFC any offer, material change,
modification or development to a previously made offer, letter of intent or
any other material development, TFC (or its outside counsel) shall (A) advise
and confer with ONB (or its outside counsel) regarding the progress of
negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal, the material resolved and
unresolved issues related thereto and the material terms (including material
amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms) of any
such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and (B) promptly upon receipt
or delivery thereof provide ONB with true, correct and complete copies of any
document or communication related thereto.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.06 shall prohibit TFC from at any time
taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the 1934 Act or from making any other disclosure to
its shareholders or in any other regulatory filing if, in the good faith
judgment of the TFC Board of Directors, after consultation with its outside
counsel, failure to so disclose would be reasonably likely to result in a
breach of their or TFCs obligations under applicable law.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean (i) any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group of Persons (other than as
contemplated by this Agreement) relating to, or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one
transaction or a series of transactions, of (A) assets or businesses that
constitute 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets of TFC and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 20% or more of any class of equity
securities of TFC or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) any tender offer
or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any

 



39  Person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of
TFC or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) any merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture,
binding share exchange or similar transaction involving TFC, TBT or any of its

or any of TFCs other Subsidiaries or of any resulting parent company of TFC
or TBT; or (iv) any other transaction the consummation of which could

a "Person" shall include a natural Person, or any legal, commercial, or
Governmental Authority, including, a corporation, general partnership, joint
venture, limited partnership, limited liability company, trust, business
association, group acting in concert, or any Person acting in a

determines in good faith (after having received the advice of its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel), to be (i) more favorable to the
shareholders and other constituencies of TFC, including, but not limited to,
from a financial point of view, than the Merger (taking into account all the
terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any break-
up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation and

response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably capable of being
completed without undue delay taking into account all financial, legal,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

supplement, amend and update, upon the occurrence of any change prior to the
Effective Time, and as of the Effective Time, the TFC Disclosure Schedule with
respect to any matters or events hereafter arising which, if in existence or
having occurred as of the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth or described in the TFC Disclosure Schedule or this Agreement and
including, without limitation, any fact which, if existing or known as of the
date hereof, would have made any of the representations or warranties of TFC
contained herein materially incorrect, untrue or misleading. No such
supplement, amendment or update shall become part of the TFC Disclosure
Schedule unless ONB shall have first consented in writing with respect
thereto.

5.09 _Access; Information_. ONB and TFC, and their representatives and
agents, shall, upon reasonable notice to the other party, in a manner not

the other party and their Subsidiaries and of their financial and legal
condition as deemed necessary or advisable to familiarize themselves with
such operations, books, records, properties and other matters; provided,
however, that such access or investigation shall not interfere unnecessarily
with the normal business operations of TFC or ONB or either of
their Subsidiaries. Upon request, TFC and ONB will furnish the other party or
its representatives or agents, their attorneys responses to external auditors
requests for information, management letters received from their external
auditors and such financial, loan and operating data and other information
reasonably requested by ONB or TFC which has been or is developed by the other
party, its auditors, accountants or attorneys (provided with respect to
attorneys, such disclosure would not result in the waiver by the other party
of any claim of attorney-client privilege), and will permit ONB or TFC or
their representatives or agents to discuss such information directly with any
individual or firm performing auditing or accounting functions for TFC or
ONB, as applicable, and such auditors and accountants will be directed to
furnish copies of any reports or financial information as developed to ONB or
TFC or its representatives or agents, as applicable. No investigation by
ONB or TFC shall affect the representations and warranties made by TFC or ONB
herein. Any confidential information or trade secrets received by ONB, TFC or
their representatives or agents in the course of such examination will be
treated confidentially, and any correspondence, memoranda, records, copies,
documents and electronic or other media of any kind containing such
confidential information or trade secrets or both shall be destroyed by ONB or
TFC, as applicable, or at ONBs or TFCs request, returned to ONB or TFC, as

received by ONB or TFC, or either of their agents or representatives in the
course of their examinations (whether conducted prior to or after the date of
this Agreement) shall be treated confidentially and in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 11.09 hereof). This Section
5.09 will not require the disclosure of any information to ONB or TFC which
would be prohibited by law. The ability of ONB or TFC to consult with any tax
advisor (including a tax advisor independent from all other entities involved
in the transactions contemplated hereby) shall not be limited by this
Agreement in any way, provided that any such tax advisor is otherwise subject
to and is bound by this Section 5.09. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary (other than the preceding sentence), except as reasonably necessary
to comply with applicable securities laws, ONB and TFC (and each employee,
representative or agent of ONB and TFC) may disclose to any and all Persons,
without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment (as defined in Treas. Reg.
§ 1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any
kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are or have been provided
to ONB or TFC relating to such tax structure, provided that, in the case of
any materials that contain information other than the tax treatment or tax
structure of the transactions contemplated hereby (including, but not limited
to, any information relating to the pricing or any cost of the transactions
contemplated hereby or the identity of any party to the transactions
contemplated hereby), this sentence shall apply to such materials only to the
extent that such materials contain the tax treatment or tax structure of the
transactions contemplated hereby and ONB and TFC shall take all action
necessary to prevent the disclosure of such other information as otherwise
provided herein. The immediately preceding sentence shall not be effective
until the earliest of (a) the date of the public announcement of discussions
relating to any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) the date of the
public announcement of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or (c) the
date of the execution of an agreement, with or without conditions, to enter

financial statements which have been prepared on its behalf or at its
direction, the monthly consolidated unaudited balance sheets and profit and
loss statements of TFC prepared for its internal use, TBTs Call Reports for
each quarterly period completed prior to the Effective Time, and all other
financial reports or statements submitted to regulatory authorities after the

Financial Statements"). The Subsequent TFC Financial Statements will be
prepared on a basis consistent with past accounting practices and GAAP to the
extent applicable and shall present fairly the financial condition and
results of operations as of the dates and for the periods presented (except in
the case of unaudited financials or Call Report information for the absence of
notes and/or year-end adjustments). The Subsequent TFC Financial
Statements, including the notes thereto, will not include any assets,
liabilities or obligations or omit to state any assets, liabilities or
obligations, absolute or contingent, or any other facts, which inclusion or
omission would render such financial statements inaccurate, incomplete or
misleading in any material respect. As soon as internally available after the
date of this Agreement, ONB will deliver to TFC any additional audited
consolidated financial statements which have been prepared on its behalf or
at its direction and the quarterly consolidated unaudited balance sheets and

Statements"). The Subsequent ONB Financial Statements will be prepared on a
basis consistent with past accounting practices and GAAP to the extent
applicable and shall present fairly the financial condition and results of

and/or year-end adjustments). The Subsequent ONB Financial Statements,
including the notes thereto, will not include any assets, liabilities or
obligations or omit to state any assets, liabilities or obligations, absolute
or contingent, or any other facts, which inclusion or omission would render
such financial statements inaccurate, incomplete or misleading in any material
respect.

environmental consulting firm designated by ONB in connection with the
conduct by such firm of a phase one and/or phase two environmental
investigation on all real property owned or leased by TFC or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, and any real property acquired
or leased by TFC or any of its Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement.
ONB shall be responsible for the costs of the phase ones and, if any phase
twos are determined to be advisable by the environmental consulting firm, TFC
and ONB shall each be responsible for 50% of the costs of the phase twos.

(b) If the environmental consultants good faith estimate, based upon
the results of the environmental studies and other diligence conducted by the
environmental consultant, of the dollar amount, if any, that TFC and its
Subsidiaries would be required to expend under applicable Environmental Laws
for clean-up, remediation and penalties relating to pollutants, contaminants,
wastes, toxic substances, petroleum, petroleum products and any other
materials regulated under the Environmental Laws with respect to TFC or its
Subsidiaries owned or leased real properties or any adjoining properties, is
in excess of $1.5 million, then ONB shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(iv), which termination shall be ONBs
sole remedy in such event.

provision of this Agreement or (d) a material delay in the consummation of the
Merger except, in each case, as may be required by applicable law
or regulation.

5.14 _Employee Benefits_. Except as contemplated by Section 6.03(j) hereof,
neither the terms of Section 6.03 hereof nor the provision of any employee

understanding with or employment rights for, or constitute a commitment or
obligation of employment to, any of the officers or employees of TFC or any of

before or after the Effective Time, from changing, amending or terminating
any employee benefits provided to its employees from time to time.

cafeteria plan participants elect to defer from compensation.

 



43 As of the date of any future termination of the TFC cafeteria plan, the
balances in the health and dependent care flexible spending accounts
thereunder shall be transferred to the ONB cafeteria plan, and the benefit and

Statement and any amendments and supplements thereto are referred to in this
Agreement as the "Registration Statement." The Registration Statement shall

Continuing Employees will receive credit for prior service with TFC or its
Subsidiaries, or their predecessors, for purposes of eligibility and vesting
under the employee benefit plans of ONB and its Subsidiaries. To the extent

12-month period of coverage, Continuing Employees and any Eligible Retirees
under age 65 shall be given credit under the applicable plan for any
deductibles and co-insurance payments made by such Continuing Employees and
any Eligible Retirees under age 65 under the corresponding TFC plan during
the balance of such 12-month period of coverage provided that ONB can obtain,
in a manner satisfactory to ONB, as determined in its sole discretion, the
necessary data.

of the Old National Bancorp Employee Stock Ownership and Savings Plan ("ONB

ONB KSOP, and (ii) Continuing Employees participating in the ONB KSOP shall
receive credit for eligibility and vesting purposes, for the service of such
employees with TFC and its Subsidiaries or their predecessors prior to the
Effective Time, as if such service were with ONB or its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) In accordance with Section 6.03(a) hereof, after the Effective Time, ONB
shall continue to maintain all employee welfare benefit, and cafeteria plans

of TFC and its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time, up to but not beyond one
hundred and sixty (160) hours per Continuing Employee, shall be carried
over to ONBs sick time policy.

(g) After the Effective Time, ONB shall continue to maintain and administer,
in accordance with the provisions thereof, the TFC Stock Option Plans until
such time as all options granted or awarded thereunder as of the Effective
Time have been exercised or lapse, whichever occurs first.

 



47 (h) Until the Effective Time, TFC or a Subsidiary of TFC, whichever is
applicable, shall be liable for all obligations for continued health coverage
pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 through 609 of ERISA
("COBRA") for eligible employees who incur a qualifying event before the
Effective Time. ONB or an ONB Subsidiary, whichever is applicable, shall
after the Effective Time be liable for (i) all obligations for continued
health coverage under COBRA with respect to each qualified beneficiary of TFC
or a Subsidiary of TFC who incurs a termination on and after the Effective
Time, and (ii) for continued health coverage under COBRA from and after the
Effective Time for each qualified beneficiary of TFC or a Subsidiary of TFC
who incurs a qualifying event before the Effective Time.

"Severance Policy"), for purposes of calculating the severance benefits
payable under the Severance Policy, each TFC Employee shall be given full
credit for prior years of employment with TFC or a Subsidiary of TFC.

 

(j) As of the Effective Time, ONB shall assume all obligations under the
Employment Agreements, Change in Control Agreements and Retention Agreements
between a Subsidiary and those individuals specified in Schedule 6.03(j).

provision of this Agreement or (d) a material delay in the consummation of
the Merger except, in each case, as may be required by applicable law or
regulation.

and directors of TFC and TBT immediately before the Effective Time to be
covered for a period of one (1) year from the Effective Time by the directors
and officers liability insurance policy maintained by TFC (provided that ONB
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to such
officers and directors than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions
occurring before the Effective Time; provided, further, that in no event shall
ONB be required to expend pursuant to this Section 6.05 more than an amount
per year equal to 150% of the annual premiums paid by TFC as of the Effective
Time for such insurance; provided, however, that if the cost exceeds such
limit, ONB shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain as much comparable
insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount.

 

6.06 _Short-Swing Trading Exemption_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Board of
Directors of ONB shall adopt such resolutions as necessary to cause any
shares of ONB Common Stock to be received by executive officers and directors

provided in Rule 16b-3(d) under the 1934 Act.

 

6.07 _Material Changes to ONB Disclosure Schedules_. ONB shall promptly
supplement, amend and update, upon the occurrence of any change prior to the
Effective Time, and as of the Effective Time, the ONB Disclosure Schedule with
respect to any matters or events

 



48  hereafter arising which, if in existence or having occurred as of the date
of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in
the ONB Disclosure Schedule or this Agreement and including, without
limitation, any fact which, if existing or known as of the date hereof, would
have made any of the representations or warranties of ONB contained herein
materially incorrect, untrue or misleading. No such supplement, amendment or
update shall become part of the ONB Disclosure Schedule unless TFC shall have
first consented in writing with respect thereto.

 

6.08 _Governmental Report and Shareholder Information_. Promptly upon its
becoming publicly available, ONB shall furnish to TFC one (1) copy of each

the Outside Date and would result in any condition set forth in Section 7.01
not being satisfied prior to the Outside Date;

(ii) TFC breaches or fails to perform any of its representations, warranties
or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform

as of the Effective Time, as compared to that in existence as of the date of

(iv) ONB elects to exercise its right to terminate pursuant to Section 5.11.

 



53 (d) by written notice from TFC to ONB if:

 

(i) any event shall have occurred which is not capable of being cured prior to
the Outside Date and would result in any condition set forth in Section 7.02
not being satisfied prior to the Outside Date;

(ii) ONB breaches or fails to perform any of its representations, warranties

(g) by written notice by TFC to ONB if, and only if both of the following
conditions are satisfied at any time during the five-day period commencing on
the Determination Date, such termination to be effective on the tenth day
following the Determination Date:

 

(i) The ONB Market Value on the Determination Date is less than $10.85; and

 

(ii) the number obtained by dividing the ONB Market Value by the Initial ONB
Market Value shall be less than the number obtained by dividing (x) the Final
Index Price by (y) the Initial Index Price minus 0.20;

 



54 _subject_ , _however_ , to the following three sentences. If TFC elects to
exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section 8.01(g), it shall
give prompt written notice thereof to ONB. During the five business day period
commencing with its receipt of such notice, ONB shall have the option to
increase the Exchange Ratio to equal the lesser of (x) a quotient, the
numerator of which is equal to the product of the Initial ONB Market Value,
the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect), and the Index Ratio minus 0.20 and the
denominator of which is equal to the ONB Market Value on the Determination
Date; or (y) the quotient determined by dividing the Initial ONB Market Value
by the ONB Market Value on the Determination Date, and multiplying the
quotient by the product of the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and 0.80.
If within such five business day period, ONB delivers written notice to TFC
that it intends to proceed with the Merger by paying such additional
consideration as contemplated by the preceding sentence, and notifies TFC of
the revised Exchange Ratio, then no termination shall have occurred pursuant
to this Section 8.01(g), and this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms (except that the Exchange Ratio shall have
been so modified). For purposes of clarification, the adjustments to the
Exchange Ratio contemplated by Sections 2.02 of this Agreement shall be
calculated and applied subsequent to any adjustment to the Exchange Ratio
pursuant to this Section 8.01(g).

 

For purposes of this Section 8.01(g), the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated below:

 

" _Determination Date_ " shall mean the first date on which all Regulatory
Approvals (and waivers, if applicable) necessary for consummation of the
Merger have been received (disregarding any waiting period)."

" _Final Index Price_ " means the average of the daily closing value of the
Index for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the
Determination Date."

 

" _Index_ " means the NASDAQ Bank Index or, if such Index is not available,
such substitute or similar Index as substantially replicates the NASDAQ Bank
Index.

" _Index Ratio_ " means the Final Index Price divided by the Initial Index
Price.

 

" _Initial ONB Market Value_ " means $13.56, adjusted as indicated in the last
sentence of this Section 8.01(g).

 

" _Initial Index Price_ " means the closing value of the Index on the date of
this Agreement.

 

" _ONB Market Value_ " means, as of any specified date, the average of the
daily closing sales prices of a share of ONB Common Stock as reported on the
NASDAQ Global Market for the ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately
preceding such specified date.

 

If ONB or any company belonging to the Index declares or effects a stock
dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange
of shares or similar transaction between the date of this Agreement and the
Determination Date, the prices for the common stock of such company shall be
appropriately adjusted for the purposes of applying this Section 8.01(g).

 



55 8.02 _Effect of Termination_. (a) Subject to the remainder of this Section
8.02, in the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and have no effect,
without any liability on the part of ONB or TFC and each of their respective
directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents, or shareholders and all
rights and obligations of any party under this Agreement shall cease, except
for the agreements contained in this Section 8.02 and Section 11.11, which
shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this
Agreement; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 8.02(a),
except for the fees payable pursuant to subsections (b), (c) or (d), shall
relieve any party hereto from liabilities or damages arising out of any fraud
or intentional breach by such party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement.

 

(b) TFC shall pay to ONB an amount in cash equal to $4,500,000 (the
"Termination Fee") if:

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by ONB pursuant to Section 8.01(e); or

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(i) as a result of the failure of TFCs shareholders to approve the
Agreement and the Merger by the requisite vote or by ONB pursuant to Section
8.01(f) and, in each case, prior to the date that is twelve months after such
termination TFC or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any Acquisition
Agreement or any Acquisition Proposal is consummated (regardless of whether
such Acquisition Proposal is made or consummated before or after termination
of this Agreement), provided, however, that in such case TFC shall only be
liable to pay ONB the amount of the Termination Fee less the amount of any
ONB Expenses previously paid to ONB pursuant to Section 8.02(d) by TFC; or

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by either TFC or ONB pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(iii) and (A) prior to the date of such termination, an Acquisition
Proposal was made, and (B) prior to the date that is twelve months after such
termination, TFC or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any Acquisition
Agreement or any Acquisition Proposal is consummated.

 

(c) Any fee due under Section 8.02(b) shall be paid by TFC by wire transfer of
same day funds:

 

(i) in the case of Section 8.02(b)(i), concurrently with such termination; and

 

(ii) in the case of Section 8.02(b)(ii) or Section 8.02(b)(iii), on the
earlier of the date TFC enters into such Acquisition Agreement or consummates
such Acquisition Proposal.

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant
to Section 8.01(b)(i) as a result of the failure of TFCs shareholders to
approve the Agreement and the Merger by the requisite vote or by ONB pursuant
to Section 8.01(f) under circumstances in which the Termination Fee is not
then payable pursuant to this Section 8.02, then TFC shall promptly (but in
any event within two business days) following receipt of an invoice therefor
all of ONBs actual and reasonably documented out of pocket fees and
expenses (including

 



56  reasonable legal fees and expenses) actually incurred by ONB and its
affiliates on or prior to the termination of this Agreement in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("ONB Expenses") as directed
by ONB in writing; provided, however, that the existence of circumstances
which could require the Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by TFC
pursuant to Section 8.02(b)(ii) shall not relieve TFC of its obligations to
pay the ONB Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.02(d); and provided, further,
that the payment by TFC of ONB Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.02(d) shall
not relieve TFC of any subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 8.02(b) except to the extent indicated in Section
8.02(b)(ii).

(e) In the event that TFC owes the Termination Fee and/or fees and expenses
to ONB pursuant Sections 8.02(b), then the payment of such amounts shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy for those termination events and shall
constitute liquidated damages. TFC acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 8.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, ONB would not have entered
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if TFC fails promptly to pay the amounts
due pursuant to this Section 8.02, and, in order to obtain such payment, ONB
commences a suit that results in a judgment against TFC for the amounts set
forth in this Section 8.02, TFC shall pay to ONB its reasonable costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit and any appeal relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts
set forth in this Section 8.02 at the national prime rate in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made.

be deemed an admission by such party that such item represents a material
exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably
likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Further, while each party will
use commercially reasonable efforts to specifically reference each Section of
this Agreement under which such disclosure is made pursuant to such partys

shall not be deemed to be disclosed for purposes of any other Section of this
Agreement in such partys Disclosure Schedule unless it is reasonably apparent

conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, each share of TFC Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than (i) shares held as treasury stock of TFC and (ii) shares held directly or
indirectly by ONB, except shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in
satisfaction of a debt previously contracted, if any) shall become and be
converted into the right to receive in accordance with this Article:

 

(i) $6.75 cash (the "Cash Consideration"); and

 

(ii) 1.20 shares of common stock (the "Exchange Ratio") (as adjusted in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement), without par value, of ONB

The Cash Consideration and the Exchange Ratio are sometimes referred to
herein collectively as the "Merger Consideration."

(b) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option
to purchase TFC common stock (an "TFC Stock Option") without any action on
the part of any holder thereof, shall be converted automatically into an

Stock Option") equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share)
of (A) the number of shares of TFC common stock subject to such TFC Stock
Option and (B) the sum of (x) Exchange Ratio plus (y) $6.75 divided by (z)
the Average ONB Closing Price (as defined below), at an exercise price per

provided above, following the Effective Time, each ONB Stock Option will
become fully vested, and shall otherwise continue to be governed by the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under the related TFC Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, ONB shall file an appropriate registration statement with
respect to the shares of ONB Common Stock subject to ONB Stock Options and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the
registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus
contained therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding.

(c) _Deferred Stock Units_. ONB and TFC shall take all requisite action so
that, at the Effective Time, each of the deferred stock units issued and
still outstanding under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (consisting 5,133
units) shall receive cash in the amount equal to the closing price of a share
of TFC Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing.

_Section 3.2_ _Effect of Conversion_. At and after the Effective Time, each
share certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of common stock of TFC ("TFC Certificate") shall represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 



3 _Section 3.3_ _Exchange of Certificate_. Each holder of TFC common
stock shall, upon the surrender of such certificate to the Surviving
Corporation for cancellation after the Effective Time, be entitled to receive
from the Surviving Corporation a certificate representing that number of whole
shares of ONB common stock that each holder of TFC has the right to receive,
and a check in the amount of any cash that such holder has the right to
receive, including any cash in lieu of fractional share, pursuant to Section
3.1 hereof.
