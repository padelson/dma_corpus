and among First Midwest Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
Standard Bancshares, Inc., an Illinois corporation (the "Company"), and
Benjamin Acquisition Corporation, an Illinois corporation ("Merger Sub").

Recitals

A. The Proposed Transaction. Upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the parties intend to effect a strategic business combination pursuant to
which Merger Sub, a newly formed, direct, wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent,
will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger"). The Company will be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). It is the
intention of Parent that, (a) immediately following the Merger, the Company
will merge with and into Parent, with Parent being the surviving corporation
(the "Parent Merger") and (b) immediately following the Parent Merger or at
such later time as Parent may determine, Standard Bank and Trust Company, an
Illinois state chartered bank and wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company
("Company Bank Sub"), will merge with and into First Midwest Bank, an Illinois
state chartered bank and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Parent Bank
Sub"), with Parent Bank Sub being the surviving bank (the "Bank Merger"). The
Parent Merger and the Bank Merger sometimes are collectively referred to
herein as the "Subsequent Mergers".

B. Board Determinations. The respective boards of directors of the Company and
Parent have each determined that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby are consistent with, and will further, their respective
business strategies and goals, and are in the best interests of their
respective stockholders, and, therefore, have approved this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

C. Intended Tax Treatment. The parties intend the Merger and the Parent Merger
to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a single integrated
transaction that will qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") (the "Intended Tax Treatment").
The parties intend that this Agreement be and hereby is adopted as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

D. Common Voting Agreements. As an inducement to and condition of Parent's
willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain Previously Disclosed
directors, officers and shareholders of the Company are concurrently entering
into voting agreements, the form of which has been Previously Disclosed (the
"Common Voting Agreements"), pursuant to which, among other things, such
persons agree to vote all of their shares of Company Common Stock in favor of
approval of this Agreement, the Merger and any other matters required to be
approved or adopted in order to effect the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

E. Non-Competition Agreements. As an inducement to and condition of Parent's
willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain Previously Disclosed
directors, officers and shareholders of the Company are concurrently entering
into confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-competition agreements, the
form of which has been Previously Disclosed (the "Non-Competition
Agreements"), pursuant to which, among other things, such persons are
prohibited from competing with the business conducted by Parent and its
Subsidiaries. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree as follows:

accordance with this Article 3.

(b)Merger Sub Stock. Each share of Merger Sub Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

3.2Company Stock Options; Company Phantom Stock; Company Stock Settled Rights.

(a)Company Stock Options. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take,
or cause to be taken, all action, including causing the Company Board or any
committee thereof under any Company Stock Plan to take, or cause to be taken,
all action permitted under any Company Stock Plan and obtaining the consent of
each holder of a Company Stock Option to an option cancellation agreement
prior to the Closing in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, necessary to
cause any outstanding Company Stock Options, whether vested or unvested or
exercisable or unexercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time, to, as
of the Effective Time (1) be cancelled and terminated in a manner satisfactory
to Parent in its reasonable discretion and without the payment of any





consideration (unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent) other than as
provided in this Section 3.2, if any; (2) represent solely the right to
receive a lump sum cash payment payable to the holder of such Company Stock
Option pursuant to this Section 3.2, if any; and (3) no longer represent the
right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock or any other security of the
Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other person.

(1)Each holder of a Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the exercise price per share of which is less than the Merger
Consideration Value Per Share (as defined below), shall be entitled to receive
from Parent in respect of and in consideration for the cancellation and
termination of each such Company Stock Option, as soon as reasonably
practicable following, but in any event subject to, the Effective Time and in
no event later than fifteen (15) business days thereafter, an amount in cash,
without any interest and subject to any required Tax withholding, equal to the
product of (1) the excess, if any, of (A) the product of (x) the Per Common
Share Consideration and (y) the per share volume weighted average price of the
Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on
the fifteen (15) trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date as found
on Bloomberg page FMBIVWAP (or its equivalent successor page if such page is
not available) (the product of (x) and (y) being the "Merger Consideration
Value Per Share"), over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option and (2) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option; provided, however,
the payment of such cash payment shall be conditioned on the holder of such
Company Stock Option executing an acknowledgment in a form satisfactory to
Parent that such payment represents the full satisfaction of all obligations
and liabilities with respect to such Company Stock Option.

(2)In the event that the exercise price of any Company Stock Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time is equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration Value Per Share, no cash payment or other
consideration for such Company Stock Option shall be due and payable in
respect thereof and the Company Stock Option shall be cancelled and of no
further force or effect as of the Effective Time, without any further action
on the part of the Company, Parent or the holder of the Company Stock Option.
Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take or cause to be taken such action
as is necessary and reasonably satisfactory to Parent in order to terminate
the Company Stock Plans as of the Effective Time.

(b)Company Phantom Stock and Stock Appreciation Rights Plan. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall take, or cause to be taken, all action,
including causing the Company Board to pass an irrevocable resolution in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to terminate the Company Phantom Stock
Plan, effective as of the Effective Time.

(1)Each holder of "Phantom Stock", as defined under the Company Phantom Stock
Plan ("Company Phantom Stock"), outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be entitled to receive from Parent in respect of and in
consideration for the cancellation and termination of such Company Phantom
Stock, as soon as reasonably practicable following, but in any event subject
to, the Effective Time and in





no event later than ten (10) business days thereafter, an amount in cash,
payable in a lump sum, without any interest and subject to any required Tax
withholding, equal to the product of (1) the Merger Consideration Value Per
Share, multiplied by (2) the number of shares or fractional shares of such
Company Phantom Stock; provided, however, that the payment of such cash
payment shall be conditioned on the holder of such Company Phantom Stock
executing an acknowledgment in a form satisfactory to Parent that such payment
represents the full satisfaction of all obligations and liabilities with
respect to such Company Phantom Stock.

(c)Company Stock Settled Rights.

(1)In connection with entering into this Agreement, the Company Board has
authorized, pursuant to Section 2.6 of the Stock Settled Rights Agreement, the
redemption, and the Company shall redeem, the Company Stock Settled Rights in
whole, such redemption to be subject to and conditioned upon the Closing of
the Merger and the occurrence of the Effective Time, and effective as of the
Effective Time, at a redemption price per Company Stock Settled Right
calculated, consistent with the Stock Settled Rights Agreement, as the amount
by which clause (A) below exceeds clause (B) below (the "SSR Redemption
Price"), where:

(A)is the sum of (i) the product of (x) the Per Common Share Consideration and
(y) $17.99, as determined in good faith by the Independent Committee pursuant
to and consistent with the Stock Settled Rights Agreement and (ii) all cash
dividends paid on a share of Company Common Stock from February 22, 2013 to
the Effective Time (which as of the date hereof is $0.83); and

(B)is $4.65, accreting on a daily basis from February 22, 2013 at an accretion
rate of 12% (which accretion as of May 31, 2016 results in a value of $6.74),
until the later of the date that is (i) three (3) days after Parent receives
all Requisite Regulatory Approvals, (ii) the Company Shareholder Approval in
Section 7.1(a)(1) has been obtained (except for any failure to obtain such
approval due to Parent's breach of its obligations pursuant to Section 6.5 of
this Agreement to use all reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration
Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act) and (iii) the
Company has then satisfied or is then capable of satisfying the conditions set
forth in Section 7.3 hereof.

(2)Accordingly, each holder of a Company Stock Settled Right outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive from
Parent, as provided for in the Stock Settled Rights Agreement, in respect of
the redemption of each such Company Stock Settled Right, as soon as reasonably
practicable following and subject to, the Effective Time, but in no event
later than ten (10) business days thereafter, an amount in cash, without any
interest and subject to any required Tax withholding, equal to the SSR
Redemption Price.

3.3Exchange Agent.





(a)At or before the Effective Time, Parent will deposit with its transfer
agent or with a depository or trust institution of recognized standing
selected by it and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (in such capacity,
the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of certificates formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock (collectively, the "Old
Certificates"), (1) evidence of shares in book entry form or, if requested by
any holder of Old Certificates, certificates (such book entry shares and
certificates, "New Certificates"), representing the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable to holders of Old Certificates under this Article 3 and (2) an
amount equal to the aggregate cash payable to holders of Company Common Stock
pursuant to Section 3.4. At or before the Effective Time, Parent will also
deposit with the Exchange Agent, which shall serve as the paying agent for
purposes of the Stock Settled Rights Agreement, an amount of cash equal to the
aggregate cash payable to holders of Company Stock Settled Rights pursuant to
Section 3.2(c).

(b)As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, but in
no event later than ten (10) business days thereafter, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to (1) mail or deliver to each person who was, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Common Stock, a
form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Old Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent) containing
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Old Certificates in
exchange for the consideration payable pursuant to this Article 3 and (2)
deliver to each person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
holder of Company Stock Settled Rights a check representing the aggregate SSR
Redemption Price such holder has the right to receive in respect of each
Company Stock Settled Right held thereby pursuant to Section 3.2(c). No
interest will accrue or be paid with respect to any New Certificate or cash to
be delivered upon surrender of Old Certificates or any cash to be delivered in
respect of the SSR Redemption Price of the Company Stock Settled Rights. If
any New Certificate is to be issued or cash is to be paid in a name other than
that in which the Old Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it will be a condition to the exchange that the Old Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form of transfer, and that the
person requesting the exchange (1) pay any transfer or other similar Taxes
required by reason of the issuance of the New Certificate or the making of the
cash payment in a name other than the name of the holder of the surrendered
Old Certificate or (2) establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent (or
the Exchange Agent, as the case may be) that any such Taxes have been paid or
are not applicable.

(c)No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
having a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to any holder of
Company Common Stock until such holder has surrendered the Old Certificate
representing such stock as provided herein. Subject to the effect of
applicable Law, following surrender of any such Old Certificates, there shall
be paid to the holder of New Certificates issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time previously payable with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock represented thereby. To the extent permitted by applicable
Law, holders of Company Common Stock who receive Parent Common Stock in the
Merger





shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of Parent
stockholders the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which
their respective shares of Company Common Stock are converted, regardless of
whether such holders of Company Common Stock have exchanged their Old
Certificates for New Certificates in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement.

(d)Parent shall be entitled to rely upon the Company's stock transfer books
and the Company's register with respect to the Company Stock Settled Rights to
establish the identity of those persons entitled to receive consideration
pursuant to this Article 3, which books and register shall be conclusive with
respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock
represented by any Old Certificate or the ownership of any Company Stock
Settled Right, Parent shall be entitled to deposit the full consideration
represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party providing for
the payment to the owner of such consideration upon resolution of such
ownership and thereafter be relieved from any and all liability and obligation
with respect to any claims thereto. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, no party hereto shall be liable to any former holder of Company
Common Stock or a Company Stock Settled Right for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

(e)The Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person
in respect to whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent. If any holder of an Old Certificate or a
Company Stock Settled Right requests payment of any cash such person is
entitled to pursuant to this Article 3 by means of a wire transfer in his, her
or its duly executed and completed letter of transmittal, the Exchange Agent
may make payment of such cash such holder is entitled to hereunder by wire
transfer in accordance with such request and the cost of any such wire
transfer shall be charged to the account of and deducted from the proceeds
paid to such holder hereunder.

3.4Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and no certificates or
scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall
be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a stockholder of Parent. Instead, Parent will pay, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later
than fifteen (15) business days thereafter, to each holder of Company Common
Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all Old Certificates delivered by such
holder) an amount in cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest cent)
determined by multiplying such fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock by
the per share volume weighted average price of the Parent Common Stock on
NASDAQ from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the





fifteen (15) trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date as found on
Bloomberg page FMBIVWAP (or its equivalent successor page if such page is not
available).

3.5Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any certificate
representing shares of Company Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash, unpaid dividends
or other distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate been
surrendered.

3.6Anti-Dilution Adjustments. If Parent changes (or the board of directors of
Parent sets a related record date that will occur before the Effective Time
for a change in) the number or kind of shares of Parent Common Stock
outstanding by way of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
reclassification, reorganization or other transaction, the Per Common Share
Consideration will be adjusted proportionately to account for such change.

3.7Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, to the extent that holders of Company Common Stock are entitled to
dissenters' rights under Section 11.65 of the IBCA, Dissenting Common Shares
that are outstanding as of the Effective Time will not be converted into the
right to receive the consideration payable in respect of Company Common Stock
pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof unless and until the holder shall have failed
to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, his, her or its right
to dissent from the Merger under the IBCA. The holder of any Dissenting Common
Share shall be treated in accordance with Section 11.70 of the IBCA and, as
applicable, shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to such
holder pursuant to Section 11.70 of the IBCA with respect thereto. Parent
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all notices
or other communications to be sent to holders of Dissenting Common Shares and
all such notices and other communications shall be reasonably satisfactory to
Parent. The Company will give Parent (a) prompt notice of any notice or
demands for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock, any
withdrawal of demand for payment and any other similar instruments received by
the Company and (b) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices at
Parent's cost and expense. The Company will not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such
demands or notices or make or offer to make any payment in respect of any such
demands or notices. Parent will pay any consideration as may be determined to
be due with respect to Dissenting Common Shares pursuant to and subject to the
requirements of applicable Law.

3.8Tangible Common Equity Calculation.

(a)Not later than ten (10) days before the expected Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent an estimated and unaudited consolidated balance sheet
of the Company, as of the expected Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet"), which shall (1) be prepared in good faith based on all
available information at





such time on a basis consistent with the Company Financial Statements and (2)
include a calculation of Tangible Common Equity as of the expected Closing
Date.

(b)After delivery of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, the parties shall
work together in good faith, which in the case of the Company shall include
providing Parent with such documentation and information in its possession or
control as Parent shall reasonably request, to agree on an updated estimated
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the expected Closing Date (the
"Final Closing Balance Sheet"), which shall (1) be prepared in good faith
based on all available information at such time on a basis consistent with the
Company Financial Statements and (2) include an updated calculation of
Tangible Common Equity as estimated as of the expected Closing Date ("Closing
Tangible Common Equity"). The Final Closing Balance Sheet, and the calculation
of the Closing Tangible Common Equity contained therein, agreed to between the
parties shall become final and binding.

(c)If, no later than the day before the expected Closing Date, Parent, in good
faith, does not believe that the condition contained in Section 7.3(g) is met,
the parties shall promptly submit any items over which a disagreement remains
to a recognized national or regional independent accounting firm mutually
acceptable to the parties, which will act as arbitrator to resolve the
remaining disputed items (the "Independent Arbitrator") and the Closing Date
shall be postponed. The parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Independent Arbitrator to resolve any dispute and issue a Final
Closing Balance Sheet confirming the correct Closing Tangible Common Equity
(as determined in accordance with this Agreement), as of a new expected
Closing Date determined by the parties, within ten (10) business days
following engagement. The parties will cooperate fully with, and furnish such
information as may be requested to, the Independent Arbitrator. The Final
Closing Balance Sheet issued by the Independent Arbitrator, as well as the
amount of Closing Tangible Common Equity set forth therein, will be final and
binding on the parties. Each party will bear all costs and fees incurred by it
in connection with the foregoing arbitration; provided, however, that (1) the
fees and expenses of the Independent Arbitrator shall be borne by the Company
and Parent in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of disputed items
submitted to the Independent Arbitrator that are unsuccessfully disputed by
the Company and Parent, respectively (as determined by the Independent
Arbitrator), bears to the total amount of items submitted to the Independent
Arbitrator, and (2) for the avoidance of doubt, all after-tax costs, fees and
expenses to be borne by the Company shall not be deducted from the final
Closing Tangible Common Equity.

hereof or as an exception to one or more covenants contained in Article 4 or

5.2Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except as Previously
Disclosed, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

(a)Organization, Standing and Authority. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Illinois. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership or
leasing of its assets or property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except for any failure to be so qualified that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has listed on Schedule 5.2(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedules and made available to Parent a complete and
correct copy of the Company's Constituent Documents, each as amended to the
date hereof, and such Constituent Documents are in full force and effect.

issuable pursuant to the Company Stock Plans have been duly authorized and,
upon issuance, will be validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and

thereto, the most recent IRS determination or opinion letter, and the two most
recent annual reports on Form 5500 or 990 series and all schedules and
financial statements attached thereto. The Company has Previously Disclosed a
complete list of all employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who may

within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, are in substantial compliance

advisory letter, as applicable, from the IRS or has applied to the IRS for
such letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under Section
401(b) of the Code, and the Company is not aware of any circumstances
reasonably likely to result in the loss of the qualification of such Pension

status under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code and (B) filed a timely notice with

Benefit Arrangement under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. There is no pending
or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened, litigation relating to the
Company's Benefit Arrangements. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any of its Benefit
Arrangements that, assuming the taxable





period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, would reasonably be
expected to subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty
imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an
amount that would be material. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has incurred or reasonably expects to incur a tax or penalty imposed by
Section 4980F of the Code or Section 502(c) or (i) of ERISA in an amount that
would be material.

(4)No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 or
413 of the Code has been or is reasonably expected to be incurred by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any ongoing, frozen or
terminated "single-employer plan", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15)
of ERISA, "multiemployer plan", within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA,
or "multiple employer plan", within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code
currently or formerly maintained or contributed to by any of them, or the
single-employer plan, multiemployer plan or multiple employer plan of any
Company ERISA Affiliate. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has,
currently or at any time within the last six (6) years, sponsored, maintained,
contributed or been required to contribute to any "single employer plan",
"multiemployer plan", or "multiple employer plan", each as defined in this
paragraph.

(5)All contributions required to be made under the terms of any of the
Company's Benefit Arrangements have been timely made and all obligations in
respect of each of the Company's Benefit Arrangements have been properly
accrued or reflected on its most recent consolidated financial statements
included in the Company Financial Statements in all material respects.

(6)Except as Previously Disclosed, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligations for post-employment or post-retirement
health, medical or life insurance benefits under any Benefit Arrangement or
collective bargaining agreement, except as required by COBRA. Either the
Company or its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such plan at any time
without incurring any liability thereunder other than in respect of claims
incurred prior to such amendment or termination.

(7)Except as Previously Disclosed, there has been no amendment to,
announcement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change
in employee participation or coverage under, any Benefit Arrangements that
would materially increase the expense of maintaining such Benefit Arrangements
above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal
year. Except as provided under the existing terms of the Benefit Arrangements
Previously Disclosed, and as Previously Disclosed, neither the Company's
execution of this Agreement, the performance of its obligations hereunder, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor shareholder approval
of the transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or in combination with
another event, could (A) limit or restrict the Company's right or, following
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent's right to
administer, merge or amend in any respect or terminate any of the Company's
Benefit Arrangements, (B) entitle any of the Company's employees or





any employees of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in
severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, or (C)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant
to, any of its Benefit Arrangements, except in the event such Benefit
Arrangement is terminated in accordance with Section 6.12.

(8)Except as Previously Disclosed, without limiting the foregoing, as a result
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including as a
result of the termination of the employment of any of its employees within a
specified time of the Effective Time) no amounts paid or payable (whether in
cash, property, or in the form of benefits) by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries will be an "excess parachute payment" to a "disqualified
individual" as those terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code, without
regard to whether such payment is reasonable compensation for personal
services performed or to be performed in the future. Each Benefit Arrangement
that provides for nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A
of the Code has been and is, in all material respects, documented and operated
in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. The parties acknowledge that this
Section 5.2(t)(8) shall not apply to any Benefit Arrangements entered into at
the discretion of Parent or between Parent and its affiliates, on the other
hand, and a disqualified individual on the other hand ("Parent Arrangements")
so that, for the avoidance of doubt, compliance with this Section 5.2(t)(8)
shall be determined as if such Parent Arrangements had not been entered into.

(9)Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to
provide, and no Benefit Arrangement or other agreement provides any individual
with the right to, a gross up, indemnification, reimbursement or other payment
for any excise or additional taxes, interest or penalties incurred pursuant to
Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code or due to the failure of any payment
to be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

(u)Property.

(1)Except as Previously Disclosed, the Company has good, and, in the case of
Owned Real Property, insurable, title to or, in the case of securities and
investments, a "security entitlement" (as defined in the Uniform Commercial

leasehold interest in, all property (whether real or personal, tangible or
intangible, and including securities and investments) and assets purported to
be owned or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, free and clear
of all Liens except for Permitted Liens. No other person has any interest in
any mineral, mining, oil or gas rights to produce or share in the production
of anything related thereto, relating to any Owned Real Property. With regard

knowledge, each of the other parties thereto, has performed in all material
respects all material obligations required to be performed by it under each
Lease.

complete and accurate list of all Owned Real Property (including OREO) and

amendments, addendums, exhibits, letter agreements and similar documents

Knowledge, the counterparty or counterparties thereto, is enforceable in
accordance with the terms of such Contract (except as enforcement may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors' rights or by general equity principles) and is in full
force and effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, and, to the
Company's Knowledge, any counterparty or counterparties, is in material breach
of any provision of or in material default (or, with the giving of notice or

commercially reasonable insurance coverage for normal risks incident to the
respective businesses of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and the
respective properties and

character and amount that is at least equivalent to that typically carried by
persons engaged in similar businesses and subject to the same or similar
perils or hazards. The Company has Previously Disclosed a complete and correct
list of each Contract representing such coverage as of the date hereof.

(y)Trust Business.

(1)Since January 1, 2008, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has, in all
material respects, properly administered all instruments, indentures,

other party or beneficiary thereto (as applicable), in accordance with the
term of those instruments.

(4)To the Company's Knowledge, there has been no event of default or violation

Agency Account.

(5)To the Company's Knowledge, no event has occurred (including the execution

Trust or Agency Agreement are in the possession or control of the Company or
one of the Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries regularly perform an

Subsidiaries pursuant to the Trust or Agency Agreements against the assets
actually held by the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Trust or
Agency Agreements, and no such audit has indicated any material discrepancies.

(z)Loans.

ARITCLE 6

Covenants

6.1Commercially Reasonable Efforts.

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, the Company and Parent will use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, in good faith, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, desirable or advisable
under applicable Law, so as to permit consummation of the Merger and the
Subsequent Mergers as promptly as practicable and otherwise to enable
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and each will cooperate
with, and furnish information to, the other party to that end.

(b)The Company and Parent will give prompt notice to the other of any fact,
event or circumstance known to it that (1) is reasonably likely, individually
or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it,
to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (2) would cause
or constitute a breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article 7.

(c)From time to time on or prior to the Closing Date, the Company and Parent
shall promptly, after it becomes aware, supplement any of its representations
and warranties with respect to any fact, change, event or circumstance that
has had or is reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or
which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein by delivering a supplemental Disclosure Schedule
("Supplemental Disclosure Schedule"); provided that any failure to give notice
in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be
deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.1(c) or the failure of any
condition set forth in Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 to be satisfied, or
otherwise constitute a breach of this





Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the
underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions
set forth in Section 7.2 or Section 7.3. The information contained in any such
Supplemental Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to have modified any of
the representations and warranties of the Company or Parent contained in this
Agreement or be considered Previously Disclosed unless it is expressly
accepted as such in writing by the other party.

6.2Stockholder Approvals. (a) As promptly as practicable following the date
upon which the Registration Statement, filed pursuant to Section 6.5, shall
have become effective (but in any event within forty-five (45) days thereof),
the Company Board will submit to its shareholders the Company Shareholder
Matters and any other matters required to be approved or adopted by such
shareholders in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance ofthat obligation, the
Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its Constituent
Documents, all action necessary, proper, desirable or advisable to convene a
meeting of its shareholders (including any adjournment or postponement, the
"Company Meeting") as promptly as practicable (but in any event within forty-
five (45) days of the Registration Statement becoming effective) to consider
and vote upon approval of the Company Shareholder Matters and any such other
matters. The Company and the Company Board, as applicable, will each use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from each class of the Company's
shareholders the required vote to approve the Company Shareholder Matters and
any such other matters, including soliciting proxies through the Joint Proxy
Statement in accordance with applicable Law and recommending that the
Company's shareholders vote in favor of the Company Shareholder Matters (and
including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement). The Company shall
provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon all
proxy materials prior to the distribution of such proxy materials to
shareholders of the Company and all such proxy materials shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Parent prior to the distribution thereof. However, if the
Company Board, after consultation with outside advisors including its outside
legal counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors,
determines in good faith that continuing to recommend this Agreement and the
Company Shareholder Matters would result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, then, in submitting this Agreement and the Merger
to the Company Meeting, the Company Board may withhold or withdraw or modify
in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation that Company's shareholders
approve this Agreement or submit this Agreement to its shareholders without
recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the
date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Company Board
may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the shareholders
in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto
to the extent required by law; provided that the Company Board may not take
any actions under this sentence until after giving Parent at least five (5)
business days to respond to such Acquisition Proposal or other event or
circumstances giving rise to the determination by the Company Board to take
such action (and, in the event such action is taken in response to an
Acquisition Proposal, after giving Parent notice of the third party in the
Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal) and then taking into account any amendment or modification to this
Agreement proposed by Parent. Any material amendment to any







Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of this Section 6.2 and will require a new notice period as referred
to in this Section 6.2. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to
excuse (1) the Company or the Company Board from complying with its obligation
to submit this Agreement and the other Company Shareholder Matters to its
shareholders at the Company Meeting or (2) any party to a Common Voting
Agreement from complying with its obligations thereunder. Neither the Company
nor the Company Board shall submit any Acquisition Proposal other than the
Merger to the vote of its shareholders unless this Agreement shall have first
been terminated in accordance with its terms.

(b)The Company shall adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting if, as of the
time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient
shares of Company Voting Common Stock or Company Non-Voting Common Stock, as
applicable, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such
meeting, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number
of shares necessary to approve all of the Company Shareholder Matters, and the
Company shall continue to use all reasonable best efforts to assist in the
solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating to the approval of the
Company Shareholder Matters. The Company shall only be required to adjourn or
postpone the Company Meeting twice pursuant to this Section 6.2(b).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company Meeting shall be
convened, and the Company Shareholder Matters shall be submitted to the
shareholders of the Company at the Company Meeting for approval in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed
to relieve the Company of such obligation.

(c)As promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Registration
Statement, filed pursuant to Section 6.5, shall have become effective (but in
any event within forty-five (45) days thereof), the Board of Directors of
Parent will submit to its stockholders the Parent Common Stock Issuance. In
furtherance of that obligation, Parent will take, in accordance with
applicable Law and its Constituent Documents, all action necessary, proper,
desirable or advisable to convene a meeting of its stockholders (including any
adjournment or postponement, the "Parent Meeting") as promptly as practicable
(but in any event within forty-five (45) days of the Registration Statement
becoming effective) to consider and vote upon approval of the Parent Common
Stock Issuance. Parent and the Board of Directors of Parent, as applicable,
will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from Parent's stockholders a
vote approving the Parent Common Stock Issuance, including soliciting proxies
through the Joint Proxy Statement in accordance with applicable Law and
recommending that Parent's stockholders vote in favor of the Parent Common
Stock Issuance (and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement).

(d)Parent and the Company shall cooperate to schedule and convene the Parent
Meeting and the Company Meeting on the same date. Each party shall cooperate
and keep the other party informed on a current basis regarding its
solicitation efforts and voting results following the dissemination of the
Joint Proxy Statement to the stockholders of each party.





6.3Regulatory Applications; Third-Party Consents.

(a)Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent and their respective
Subsidiaries will cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to prepare as
promptly as practicable all documentation, to make all filings and to obtain
all consents, approvals, permits and other authorizations of all Governmental
Authorities necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Subsequent Mergers, or those the failure of
which to be obtained would reasonably be likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a material and adverse effect on Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, (the "Requisite Regulatory Approvals"), and to make and obtain
all other Required Third‑Party Consents; notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
and the Company will use reasonable best efforts to prepare and file, or cause
their respective Subsidiaries to prepare and file, any applications, notices
and filings required in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals
within twenty-five (25) days of the date of this Agreement. Each of the
Company and Parent will have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable, each will consult with the other, in each case subject to
applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, with respect to all
material written information submitted to any third party or any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Requisite Regulatory Approvals and the
Required Third-Party Consents, other than any information which is otherwise
confidential. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties will act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party agrees that it will
consult with the other party with respect to obtaining all material permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, and each party will keep the other party appraised of the status of
material matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(b)The Company and Parent will, upon request (but subject to applicable
confidentiality requirements), furnish the other party with all information
concerning itself, its Affiliates, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary, proper, desirable or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other party or any of its Affiliates with or to any third party
or Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and to respond to any comment letters received in connection therewith.

(c)Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement:

(1)The Company (or any Subsidiary thereof) shall not amend, modify, extend,
supplement or waive any of the material terms and conditions of any Material
Contract without the prior written consent of Parent, nor shall the Company or
any Subsidiary thereof, without the prior written consent of Parent, pay or
commit to pay to any person whose consent, waiver or approval is being sought
any cash or other consideration, make any accommodation or commitment to incur
any liability or other obligation to such person in connection with such
consent, waiver or approval, except for immaterial customary fees and expenses
expressly imposed by the terms of any such





Material Contract; provided that in connection therewith, Parent shall not
unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its consent; and

(2)Nothing shall require Parent to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, agree to, take any action or
commit to take any action in connection with, or agree to any condition on, or
request with respect to, any Requisite Regulatory Approval that would (i)
materially and adversely affect the business, operations or financial
condition of Parent (measured on a scale relative to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), (ii) require Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to make any material covenants or commitments, or complete any
divestitures, whether prior to or subsequent to the Closing, (iii) result in a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
or (iv) or restrict in any material respect or impose a material burden on
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective Time, the
Company and its Subsidiaries) in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or with respect to the business or operation of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) (for purposes of clause (iv), materiality shall be measured on a
scale relative to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (a
"Burdensome Condition").

6.4Exchange Listing. Parent will use reasonable best efforts to cause the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, as promptly as
practicable, and in any event before the Effective Time.

6.5SEC Filings.

(a)Parent will prepare a registration statement on Form S-4 or other
applicable form (the "Registration Statement") to be filed by Parent with the
SEC in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger
(including the notice, proxy statement and prospectus and other proxy
solicitation materials of the Company and Parent constituting a part thereof
(the "Joint Proxy Statement") and all related documents). The parties agree to
cooperate, and to cause their Subsidiaries to cooperate, with the other party,
its counsel and its accountants, in the preparation of the Registration
Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement and to use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the filing of the Registration Statement with the SEC within
sixty (60) days following the date of this Agreement. Parent will use all
reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after
filing thereof and to maintain the effectiveness (including by filing any
necessary amendments or supplements) of such Registration Statement until the
Effective Time. Parent also agrees to use all reasonable best efforts to
obtain all necessary state securities Law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals
required to carry out the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company agrees
to promptly furnish to Parent all information concerning the Company, its
Affiliates, officers, directors and shareholders as may be reasonably
requested in connection with the foregoing, in a form appropriate (or from
which such information can be derived in a commercially reasonable manner) for
usage in such document or any such other use.





(b)The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its Affiliates, that
none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (1) the Registration Statement will, at the time
the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any,
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (2) the Joint
Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
mailing to shareholders and at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not
misleading. The Company and Parent each further agrees that if it becomes
aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements
in the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement to be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to
promptly inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to
correct the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement.

(c)Parent shall promptly provide the Company with all comment letters from the
SEC or its Staff pertaining to the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement relating to the Company. The Company will, upon request, promptly
furnish Parent with all information concerning itself, its Affiliates,
directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary, proper, desirable or advisable in order for Parent to
respond promptly to any comments received from the SEC. Parent will advise the
Company, promptly after Parent receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has
been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the
qualification of Parent Common Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction,
of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any
request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Registration
Statement or for additional information.

6.6Press Releases. Each party will consult with the other before issuing any
press release, employee communication or other shareholder communication with
respect to the Merger or this Agreement and will not issue any such press
release or make any such communication without the prior written consent of
such other party, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided
that a party may, without the prior written consent of the other party (but
after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances),
issue such press release or make such communication as may be required by
applicable Law or securities exchange rules. The Company and Parent will
cooperate to develop all public communications of the Company and make
appropriate members of management available at presentations related to the
transactions contemplated hereby as reasonably requested by the other party.

6.7Acquisition Proposals. The Company agrees that it will not, and will cause
its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives, agents,
advisors and affiliates not to, solicit or encourage in any way inquiries or
proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or
provide any confidential nonpublic information to, or have any





discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; provided
that, in the event the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition
Proposal and the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company may, and may permit its
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives to, furnish or
cause to be furnished nonpublic information and participate in such
negotiations or discussions if the Company Board concludes in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
actions would be result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; provided, further, that, prior to providing any nonpublic
information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, it
shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on
terms no less favorable to it than the confidentiality provisions set forth in
the Confidentiality Agreement (without regard to any modification thereof
pursuant hereto or lapse of time). The Company will immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted
before the date of this Agreement with any persons other than Parent with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts
to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company will promptly advise Parent following receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof (including the identity of the
person making such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent apprised of any
related developments on a current basis.

6.8Takeover Laws and Provisions. The Company will not take any action that
would cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Law and will take or cause to be taken all
commercially reasonable steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the
continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated hereby from, or if
necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover
Law, as now or hereafter in effect.

6.9Access; Information.

(a)The Company and Parent each agree that upon reasonable notice and subject
to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, each will (and will
cause its Subsidiaries to) afford each other, and their respective
Representatives, such reasonable access during normal business hours
throughout the period before the Effective Time to the books, records
(including Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), properties,
personnel and to such other information in its possession or control as either
the Company or Parent may reasonably request under the circumstances,
including for purposes of facilitating the Conversion and the integration of
the Company and its Subsidiaries with Parent and its Subsidiaries. In
addition, the Company will furnish promptly to Parent (1) a copy of each
report, schedule and other document filed by it pursuant to the requirements
of federal or state banking or securities Laws, and (2) all other information
in its possession or control concerning the business, properties and personnel
of it and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request. In addition, the
Company shall provide Parent biweekly or monthly, as applicable, general
ledger reports and reports of all new Loans greater than $100,000, deposits,
non-performing loans, OREO and Loans in the process of being negotiated,
renegotiated, extended, renewed, modified or having a forbearance granted, in
each case for each biweekly period beginning with the first full week after
the date hereof until the Effective





Time as promptly as they become available. The Company and Parent each agree
to promptly notify the other of any action, suit, claim, hearing, dispute,
subpoena, investigation or proceeding commenced, or to the Knowledge of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, threatened against the Company or Parent or
any of their respective Subsidiaries that are related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor Parent will be
required to afford access or disclose information that would jeopardize
attorney-client privilege or contravene any binding agreement with any third
party. The parties will make appropriate substitute arrangements in
circumstances where the previous sentence applies. Each of the Company and
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference
with the regular business operations of the Company or Parent and their
respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, during any such access.

(b)No investigation by Parent or the Company of, or Knowledge that Parent or
the Company may have with respect to, the business and affairs of the other
party, pursuant to this Section 6.9 or otherwise, will affect or be deemed to
modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement, or the conditions to Parent's or the Company's, as applicable,
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c)Each of Parent and the Company will hold any information it may obtain from
the other in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby which is nonpublic and confidential to the extent required by, and in
accordance with, the Confidentiality Agreement.

6.10Supplemental Indentures. At or before the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, by or
on behalf of Parent and the Company, one or more supplemental indentures and
other instruments, and take or cause to be taken all such other action,
required for the due assumption of the Company's outstanding debt, guarantees,
securities, and (to the extent Previously Disclosed by the Company) other
agreements to the extent required by the terms of such debt, guarantees,
securities or other agreements.

6.11Indemnification.

(a)Following the Effective Time, Parent will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the present directors and officers (when acting in such capacity) of
the Company (each, an "Indemnified Party") against all costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities as incurred, and will advance expenses, in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions
occurring at or before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated hereby), in accordance with the Constituent Documents of Company
in effect on the date hereof, to the extent permitted under applicable Law.

(b)Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.11(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described





above, will promptly notify Parent; provided that failure so to notify will
not affect the obligations of Parent under Section 6.11(a) unless and to the
extent that Parent is actually and materially prejudiced as a consequence.

(c)For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide that portion of directors'
and officers' liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and
former officers and directors of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries
(determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims against such
directors and officers arising from facts or events which occurred before the
Effective Time, which insurance shall contain at least the same coverage and
amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous, as that
coverage currently provided by the Company; provided, however, that in no
event shall Parent be required to expend more than two hundred fifty percent
(250%) of the current annual amount expended by the Company (the "Current
Premium") to maintain or procure such directors' and officers' insurance
coverage for a comparable six (6) year period; provided, further, that if
Parent is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this
Section 6.11(c), Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for two hundred fifty
percent (250%) of the Current Premium; provided, further, that officers and
directors of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof may be required to make
application and provide customary representations and warranties to the
responsible insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such insurance. In
lieu of this Section 6.11(c), the Company may, and at the request of Parent
shall, in each case in consultation with and only with Parent's consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), obtain at or
prior to the Effective Time a six (6) year "tail" policy under the Company's
existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage
to that described in this Section 6.11(c) if and to the extent that the same
may be obtained for an amount that does not exceed two hundred fifty percent
(250%) of the Current Premium. Any amounts expended by the Company in
accordance with this Section 6.11(c) shall not be considered Transaction
Expenses for purposes of this Agreement.

(d)If Parent or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges
into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all its assets to
any other entity, then and in each case, but only to the extent not effected
by operation of law, Parent will cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent will assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.11.

(e)The provisions of this Section 6.11 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and Representatives.

6.12Benefits Arrangements.

(a)Termination of Company 401(k) Plan.





(1)At least five (5) business days prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall have adopted resolutions of its board of directors to terminate the
Company's 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan (the "Company 401(k) Plan") effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time and to fully vest all participants in
such Company 401(k) Plan. Before adopting such resolutions, the Company shall
provide a draft of such resolutions to Parent for an opportunity to comment
thereon, which Parent shall not unreasonably delay.

(2)The Company or its Subsidiaries shall make contributions to the Company
401(k) Plan with respect to the plan year commencing January 1, 2016 (and if
applicable any subsequent plan year commencing prior to the Effective Time)
and ending on the date of the Company 401(k) Plan termination in accordance
with the terms of the Company 401(k) Plan.

(3)Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall offer participation in
Parent's tax-qualified defined contribution plan ("Parent 401(k) Plan") to
each person who was an active participant in the Company 401(k) Plan as of the
date of its termination. Parent shall permit the Parent 401(k) Plan to,
following the Closing Date and pursuant to Section 401(a)(31)(D) of the Code,
accept rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of eligible amounts (including
outstanding loans) distributed to employees from the Company 401(k) Plan.

(b)Termination of Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Within the thirty
(30) days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have taken or caused
to be taken all such actions as may be necessary to terminate the Company's
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DCP") effective as of the
Effective Time and provide for lump sum payment of the benefits thereunder
within ten (10) business days after the Effective Time and to facilitate the
administration of the DCP by Parent after the Effective Time.

(c)Section 280G Shareholder Vote. The Company shall (i) at least seven (7)
business days prior to the Closing Date, use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain from each "disqualified individual" (as defined under Section 280G of
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) an irrevocable waiver by
such individual of any and all payments or other benefits contingent on the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to the extent necessary
so that such payments and benefits would not be "excess parachute payments"
under Section 280G of the Code and (ii) at least five (5) business days prior
to the Closing Date, submit for approval by its shareholders, in conformance
with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder (the "280G
Shareholder Vote"), any payments that could constitute a "parachute payment"
pursuant to Section 280G of the Code such that if such vote is adopted by the
shareholders in a manner that satisfies the shareholder approval requires
under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and regulations promulgated
thereunder, no payment received by such "disqualified individual" would be a
"parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of the Code (the "280G Approval").
In connection with the foregoing and at least five (5) business days prior to
distribution to shareholders for the 280G Shareholder Vote, the





Company shall deliver to Parent true and complete copies of all disclosure,
waiver and other documents required to be prepared by the Company in
connection with this Section 6.12(c), for review and comment by Parent
thereon. The parties acknowledge that this Section 6.12(c) shall not apply to
any Parent Arrangements, unless such arrangements have been disclosed to the
Company at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, so that, for the
avoidance of doubt, compliance with this Section 6.12(c) shall be determined
as if such Parent Arrangements that are not so disclosed had not been entered
into. Prior to the Closing Date, if and to the extent required by Section 280G
of the Code, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence that a vote of the
Company's shareholders was solicited in accordance with the foregoing
provisions of this Section 6.12(c) and that either (1) 280G Approval was
obtained, or (2) that 280G Approval was not obtained.

(d)Severance Benefits. Following the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, Parent or its Subsidiaries shall cause the employees of
the Company or the Company Bank Sub to be covered by a severance policy under
which employees who incur a qualifying involuntary termination of employment
will be eligible to receive severance pay and benefits that are no less
favorable than the severance payments and benefits set forth in the Company's
Previously Disclosed Severance Pay Benefit Policy, based on such Covered
Employee's base salary or hourly wage rate with the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time. In connection with the foregoing, such terminated
employees shall receive service credit for years of continuous service with
the Company or its Subsidiaries and Parent and its Subsidiaries for purposes
of determining the amount of any severance pay under such policy.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Company employee or Company Bank Sub
employee eligible to receive severance benefits under an employment agreement
shall be entitled to participate in the severance policy described in this
Section 6.12(d) or to otherwise receive severance benefits.

(e)Participation in Parent and Parent Bank Sub Benefit Arrangements. Following
the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain or cause to be maintained employee
benefit plans for the benefit of employees (as a group) who are employees of
the Company or Company Bank Sub on the Closing Date ("Covered Employees") that
provide employee benefits which are made available from time to time on a
uniform and non-discriminatory basis to similarly situated employees of Parent
and Parent Bank Sub, as applicable, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of such plans in effect from time to time; provided that (i) in no
event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or
frozen plan of Parent or Parent Bank Sub; and (ii) until such time as Parent
shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the benefit plans that are
made available to similarly situated employees of Parent and Parent Bank Sub,
a Covered Employee's continued participation in employee benefit plans of the
Company or Company Bank Sub shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing
provisions of this sentence (it being understood that participation in the
Parent or Parent Bank Sub Benefit Arrangements may commence at different times
with respect to each such Benefit Arrangement). To the extent that a Covered
Employee becomes eligible to participate in a Parent or Parent Bank Sub
Benefit Arrangement, Parent or Parent Bank Sub shall cause such Benefit
Arrangement to take into account for eligibility and vesting purposes
thereunder only (and not, other than in the case of vacation benefits, for
benefit accrual) the service of such employees with the Company or Company
Bank Sub as if such





service were with Parent or Parent Bank Sub, to the same extent that such
service was credited under a comparable Benefit Arrangement sponsored or
maintained by the Company or Company Bank Sub, and, with respect to welfare
benefit plans of Parent or Parent Bank Sub in which Covered Employees are
eligible to participate, Parent agrees to cause each such welfare benefit plan
to waive any preexisting conditions, waiting periods and actively at work
requirements under such plans. In no event shall such recognition of service
operate to duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to the
same period of service. For purposes of each Parent health plan, Parent shall
cause any eligible expenses incurred by Covered Employees and their covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the comparable plan of the
Company or Company Bank Sub ending on the date such employee's participation
in the corresponding Parent plan begins to be taken into account under such
Parent plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his covered
dependents for the applicable plan year of the Parent plan.

(f)Amendments; No Third Party Rights. This Section 6.12 shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Section 6.12. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be
deemed to (1) establish, amend, modify, change or terminate any Benefit
Arrangement of the Company or its Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries,
(2) alter or limit the ability of Parent or its Subsidiaries to amend, modify,
change or terminate any Benefit Arrangement or any other benefit or employment
plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date, (3) confer
upon any current or former employee or other service provider of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, any right to employment or continued employment or
continued service with Parent or of its Subsidiaries, or constitute or create
an employment or agreement with, or modify the at-will status of any, employee
or other service provider, (4) permit any payment to be made to an employee or
service provider of the Company or its Subsidiaries that requires prior
approval or non-objection from a Governmental Authority without obtaining such
prior approval or non-objection or (5) alter or limit the ability of Parent or
its Subsidiaries to exercise discretion with respect to eligibility,
participation, amounts awarded or payable, or benefits provided, under the
terms or provisions of any Benefit Arrangement of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

6.13Conversion, Data Processing and Related Matters. Prior to the Effective
Time, the parties agree to cooperate and to employ their commercially
reasonable efforts to plan, execute and complete the Conversion in an orderly
and efficient manner as of the Effective Time, or at such later time as Parent
may determine; provided, that in no event shall the Conversion become
effective prior to the Effective Time. Commencing as of the date of this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall each appoint qualified staff members
to act as project managers for the Conversion (each, a "Conversion Project
Manager"). Such Conversion Project Managers shall act as the principal
contacts between the parties on matters relating to the Conversion, and shall
coordinate the assignment of personnel as required and generally facilitate
the planning, execution and completion of the Conversion. In addition to any
conversion of the data and systems files as part of the Conversion, the
parties shall reasonably cooperate in exchanging and providing the information
requested and performing such tasks as may be





necessary to complete the Conversion, including the collection and input of
relevant data, development of new operating procedures and design of forms, in
each case, as mutually agreed by the parties. The Company shall, commencing as
of the date of this Agreement, provide Parent and Parent Bank Sub with
reasonable access to the Company Bank Sub's offices, systems and facilities
and all relevant information and personnel at such times and places as Parent
Bank Sub shall reasonably request (in connection therewith, the parties shall
cooperate towards causing the least possible disruption to the Company's and
Company Bank Sub's employees, customers and operations), allow Parent Bank Sub
to implement such changes as shall be reasonably necessary to effect the
Conversion at the Effective Time, or at such other time following the
Effective Time as Company and Parent may mutually determine. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the operations of Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Company,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of
Parent or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, each of Parent and Company shall exercise, consistent with, and subject
to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

6.14Title Surveys.

(a)The Company shall order, at the Company's sole cost and expense (which cost
and expense shall be considered Transaction Expenses for purposes of this
Agreement), within ten (10) business days after the date of this Agreement,
with respect to all Owned Real Property (including real property designated as
"other real estate owned" by the Company Bank Sub ("OREO")), (1) an ALTA
survey made in accordance with the 2016 minimum standard detail requirements
for ALTA/NSPS surveys (each a "Survey"), certified to Parent, Parent Bank Sub
and Chicago Title Insurance Company (the "Title Company"), (2) a commitment
for issuance of an ALTA 2006 Owner's Policy of Title Insurance (each a "Title
Commitment") dated subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the
Closing Date issued by the Title Company in an amount equal to the greater of
the value of such real property as shown on the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
books and records or the fair market value of such real property and (3)
copies of all documents referenced in the Title Commitment exceptions. The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (x) the delivery to
Parent of a Survey and (y) the Title Company to deliver to Parent a Title
Commitment and copies of all documents referenced in the Title Commitment
exceptions for each real property owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than OREO) as soon as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement.

(b)For each real property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
Parent will have a period of ten (10) business days from Parent's receipt of
the last of the Survey, the Title Commitment and all documents referenced in
the Title Commitment exceptions with respect to such real property ("Title
Review Period") in which to review such documents and provide the Company with
written notice ("Title Notice") of any condition disclosed in such Survey or
Title Commitment that is not reasonably approved by Parent; provided, however,
Parent shall be deemed to approve any condition that is a Permitted Lien.





(c)If a Title Notice is timely given by Parent, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly (but in any event within twenty-
five (25) days of the date of the Title Notice) cure or remove, to Parent's
reasonable satisfaction, each condition set forth on the Title Notice without
the payment of any funds. In the event the Company is unable to cure or
remove, to Parent's reasonable satisfaction, all conditions listed on all
Title Notices without the payment of any funds ("Title Defect Conditions"),
Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree prior to the Closing upon the
amount (i) necessary to cure or remove, to Parent's reasonable satisfaction,
all Title Defect Conditions that are capable of cure or removal and (ii) of
the diminution of fair market value resulting from Title Defect Conditions
that are not capable of cure or removal (collectively, the "Title Defect
Amount").

(d)The Company shall cause the Title Company to update each Title Commitment
as of the business day immediately prior to the Closing Date. In the event
that the updated Title Commitment discloses any defect not included in the
original Title Commitment, the procedure set forth in clauses (b) and (c)
above shall apply and a new Title Review Period shall begin.

(e)The Company shall cause the Title Company to deliver title insurance
policies to match the Title Commitments on or prior to the Closing Date as
requested by Parent.

(f)Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.14 to the contrary, the Company
shall keep Parent apprised of all activities and actions contemplated by this
Section 6.14, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate fully with one
another with respect to the matters required by this Section 6.14.

(g)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all matters
that have been Previously Disclosed to Parent shall be disregarded for
purposes of, and shall not constitute any type of exception to, this Section
6.14 and shall have no effect on the determination of any Title Defect
Condition, Title Defect Amount or the Real Property Adjustment Amount.

6.15Environmental Assessments.

(a)The Company hereby agrees to obtain within fifty (50) business days after
the date of this Agreement, a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment ("Phase
I") of any Owned Real Property, including any OREO property, at the Company's
cost and expense (which cost and expense shall be considered Transaction
Expenses for purposes of this Agreement), conducted by a Previously Disclosed
environmental consultant ("Environmental Consultant"). The Company and Parent
shall reasonably agree on the terms of engagement of the Environmental
Consultant. The Company shall provide Parent, within five (5) business days
after receipt of same by the Company, copies of final drafts of any such Phase
I.

(b)In the event any Phase I (including a Previously Disclosed Phase I that the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries caused to be performed within three (3)
years prior to





the date hereof) discloses any Recognized Environmental Condition (as defined
by ASTM E1527-13) that in the reasonable belief of Parent would result in
material liability to the Company, Parent or any of their Subsidiaries and
warrants further review or investigation, Parent shall reasonably promptly
give notice of the same to the Company no later than five (5) business days
following Parent's receipt of the relevant Phase I. The Company may then, in
its reasonable discretion, within an additional twenty (20) day period retain
the Environmental Consultant to conduct a Phase II Environmental Site
Assessment ("Phase II") of the relevant property or facility; provided,
however, that such Phase II shall be completed no later than forty-five (45)
days following Parent's receipt of the relevant Phase I; and provided further,
that with respect to any Leased Real Property, Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the relevant property owner's consent for such
Phase II but Parent acknowledges and understands that such consent may not be
able to be obtained. The scope of the Phase II shall be mutually determined by
Parent and the Company in their reasonable discretion after consultation with
the other party and all reasonable costs and expenses associated with such
Phase II testing and report shall be borne by the Company and shall be
considered Transaction Expenses for purposes of this Agreement. The Company
shall provide copies of the draft and final Phase I reports and Phase II
reports, if any, to Parent promptly following the receipt of any such report
by the Company.

(c)In the event any Phase II assessment confirms the presence of any
environmental contamination, including, without limitation, a release from an
abandoned underground storage tank or the presence of other Hazardous
Materials, in each case in concentrations above applicable standards under
applicable Environmental Laws, or if the Company chooses to forego any Phase
II as reasonably requested by Parent pursuant to Section 6.15(b), Parent may
elect to require the Company to obtain within thirty (30) days after Parent's
receipt of the relevant Phase I or Phase II assessment and prior to the
Closing Date at the Company's sole cost and expense (which cost and expense
shall be considered Transaction Expenses for purposes of this Agreement), from
the Environmental Consultant or another nationally-recognized contractor
(mutually acceptable to the parties), as appropriate, a good faith estimate of
the minimum cost and expense necessary to further investigate, remediate,
cleanup, abate, restore and otherwise address such Recognized Environmental
Condition or environmental contamination to the extent required by and in
accordance with Environmental Laws and, to the extent required, to the
satisfaction of any relevant Governmental Authority, assuming the continued
commercial or industrial use of the relevant property and employing risk-based
remedial standards and institutional controls where applicable (a "Remediation
Estimate"). The Company shall, at Parent's request, cause all Remediation
Estimates to be updated, as needed, through the Closing Date.

(d)In the event that the sum of the Title Defect Amount and all Remediation
Estimates (to the extent such Title Defect Amounts or Remediation Estimates
will or are reasonably expected to be incurred by the Company, Parent or any
of their Subsidiaries and taking into account any Tax credits, deductions or
benefits or insurance coverage, in each case, that the parties agree is
reasonably likely to be available to Company, Parent or any of their
Subsidiaries in connection with the incurrence of such costs) in the aggregate
exceeds $2,000,000 (such excess being the "Real Property Adjustment





Amount"), the Per Common Share Consideration shall be reduced prior to the
Closing by an amount equal to the result of: (1) the lesser of (x) the amount
of the Real Property Adjustment Amount and (y) $8,000,000, divided by (2) the
Fully Diluted Number, divided by (3) the per share volume weighted average
price of the Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.,
Eastern Time, on the fifteen (15) trading days immediately preceding the
Closing Date as found on Bloomberg page FMBIVWAP (or its equivalent successor
page if such page is not available). If the Real Property Adjustment Amount is
greater than $8,000,000, Parent may, in its sole discretion, terminate the
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) of this Agreement.

(e)The Company (i) hereby grants, and agrees to cause the Company Bank Sub to
grant, to both Parent and the Environmental Consultant a non-exclusive license
to access the Real Property during regular business hours for the purpose of
conducting the Phase I and any Phase II assessments as set forth above and
upon advance notice from Parent; and (ii) shall reasonably cooperate in
connection with the performance of any such assessments.

(f)Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.15 to the contrary, the Company
shall keep Parent reasonably apprised of all activities and actions
contemplated by this Section 6.15, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate
fully with one another with respect to the matters required by this Section
6.15.

(g)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all matters
that have been Previously Disclosed to Parent shall be disregarded for
purposes of, and shall not constitute any type of exception to, this Section
6.15 and shall have no effect on the determination of any Remediation Estimate
or the Real Property Adjustment Amount.

6.16Stockholder Litigation. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly
notify each other in writing of any action, claim, proceeding, arbitration,
audit, hearing, investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued,
commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving,
any Governmental Authority or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent or the Company, as applicable, threatened against Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would reasonably
be expected to question the validity of this Agreement or the other agreements
contemplated hereby or thereby or any actions taken or to be taken by Parent,
the Company or their respective Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto,
or (b) seeks to enjoin, materially delay or otherwise restrain the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of
any litigation against the Company and or its directors or Affiliates relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company shall not
agree to any such settlement without Parent's prior written consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

6.17Investment Agreements. Conditioned upon the Closing of the Merger and the
occurrence of the Effective Time, and effective as of the Effective Time, to
the extent not waived, Parent hereby assumes the due and punctual performance
and observance of each and every covenant and condition of each of the
Investment Agreements to be performed by the Company following the Effective
Time.





6.18Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action that is reasonably necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest Parent or the Surviving Corporation with
full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and
franchises of any of the parties to the Merger or the Parent Merger, the then
current officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take, or cause to be taken, all such reasonably
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by the other party, at the
expense of the party who makes any such request.

6.19Restructuring Efforts. If either the Company or Parent shall have failed
to obtain the requisite vote of its shareholders to approve the Company
Shareholder Matters or the Parent Common Stock Issuance, respectively, at a
duly convened Company Meeting or Parent Meeting, as applicable, or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith
use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (provided, however, that no party
shall have any obligation to agree to (1) alter or change any material term of
this Agreement, including the amount or kind of the Per Common Share
Consideration, in a manner adverse to such party or its shareholders, (2)
adversely affect the Tax treatment, including the Intended Tax Treatment, of
the Merger and the Parent Merger to the Company's shareholders or (3) forego
any of its other rights under this Agreement) and/or resubmit this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this
Section 6.19) to its shareholders for approval or adoption.

Issuance by the requisite vote of the holders of Parent Common Stock, as
follows:

(a)Mutual Agreement. With the mutual written agreement of the other party.

(b)Breach. If there has occurred and is continuing: (1) a breach by the other
party of any representation or warranty contained herein or (2) a breach by
the other party of any covenant or agreement contained herein; provided that
such breach has not been cured within the earlier of the Outside Date and
fifteen (15) days following written notice thereof and that such breach (under
either clause (1) or (2)) would entitle the non-breaching party not to
consummate the Merger under Article 7.

(c)Denial of Stockholder Approval. (1) If the Company Shareholder Matters are
not approved by the requisite votes of the holders of the Company Common Stock
at the Company Meeting and (2) in the case of the Company only, it will have

the Parent Meeting.

approval of any Governmental Authority required for consummation of the
Merger, the Bank Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby is

Regulatory Approval has been withdrawn at the request or recommendation of the
applicable Governmental Authority and such Governmental Authority would not
accept the re-filing of such application; provided that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 8.1(d) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement has been the
cause of, or materially contributed to, the foregoing.

(e)Outside Date. If the Effective Time has not occurred by the close of
business on the twelve (12) month anniversary of the date hereof (the "Outside
Date"); provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(e) shall not be available to any party whose failure to comply with any
provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or materially contributed
to, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date.

(f)Adverse Action. In the case of Parent only, it will have the right to
terminate this Agreement if (1) the Company Board (A) submits this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the other
Company







Shareholder Matters) to its shareholders without a recommendation for approval
or with material and adverse conditions on such approval (or fails to
reconfirm its recommendation after request to do so by Parent), or otherwise

referred to in Section 5.2(e), (B) recommends to its shareholders an

Acquisition Proposal and determining whether the Company Board will in fact
engage in or authorize negotiations) or (2) there is a material breach of
Section 6.7.

set forth in Article 7, other than the condition set forth in Section 7.3(f),
are satisfied or waived or, with respect to conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at Closing, capable of being satisfied or waived, Parent
reasonably believes that the condition set forth in Section 7.3(f) would not
be capable of being satisfied prior to the Outside Date; provided that Parent

intention to termination this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(i).

8.2Effect of Termination and Abandonment.

(a)Except as otherwise provided herein, a termination of this Agreement
pursuant to the terms hereof shall be effective immediately upon delivery of
written notice by the terminating party to the other parties hereto. If this

under this Agreement, except that the first sentence of Section 5.2(i),
Section 5.3(h), Section 6.9(b), this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Article 9,
as well as any relevant definitions, will survive termination of this
Agreement and remain in full force and effect and except that termination will
not relieve a party from liability for any willful breach by it of this
Agreement.

8.3Fee.





(a)In the event that, after the date hereof and on or before a Fee Termination
Date (as defined below), both (1) any of (A) the Company Board submits this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby to its

fails to convene a shareholder meeting to approve this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with Section 6.2,
(F) the Company breaches Section 6.7 of this Agreement, (G) any Principal
Shareholder has breached, and remains in breach, of its obligations under
Section 2 or Section 3(a) of the Common Voting Agreement entered into by such
Principal Shareholder, after being provided with notice of such breach and a
thirty (30) day period in which to cure such breach or (H) the Company
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(1) and (2) this Agreement
is terminated (the occurrence of any of clauses (1)(A) through (H) and such
termination shall be a "Fee Triggering Event"), then the Company will pay to
Parent a cash termination fee (the "Fee") of $15,000,000 plus all reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and in connection with enforcing the
payment of the Fee; provided that for purposes of this Section 8.3(a), all
references to "more than twenty-five percent (25%)" in the definition of
Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent
(50%) or more". The Fee will be payable, without setoff, by wire transfer in

the first occurrence of a Fee Triggering Event to an account specified by
Parent for such purpose.

(b)For purposes of this Section 8.3, "Fee Termination Date" means one (1) day
after the day on which the termination of this Agreement is effective;
provided, however, if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(b), 8.1(c) or Section 8.1(f), then, solely with respect to Section
8.3(a)(1)(B), (C) and (D), the Fee Termination Date means the twelve (12)
month anniversary of the termination of this Agreement.

(c)If the Fee has not been received by Parent within three (3) business days
following the first occurrence of a Fee Triggering Event interest shall accrue
on the Fee commencing on the forty-fifth (45th) day following the first
occurrence of a Fee Triggering Event, at an annual rate equal to the prime
rate, as published in the Wall Street Journal on the date that the Fee was
first required to be paid to Parent. The Parties acknowledge that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the
Parties would not enter into this Agreement.





(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages, the maximum aggregate
amount of fees payable by the Company under Section 8.3(a) shall be equal to
the Fee.

(e)Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may, at its written election within
forty-five (45) days following the first occurrence of a Fee Triggering Event,
forego the Fee and pursue any and all rights it may have with respect to this
Agreement, provided that if Parent does not so elect, the payment of the Fee
by the Company shall constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and
shall be the sole remedy of Parent in the event of a termination of this
Agreement.

however, after the approval of the Company Shareholder Matters by the
requisite votes of the holders the Company Common Stock or after the approval
of the Parent Common Stock Issuance by the requisite vote of the holders of
Parent Common Stock, no waiver of any term, provision or condition hereof
shall be made which by law requires further approval of the shareholders of
the Company unless such further approval is obtained. Each and every right
granted to any party hereunder, or under any other document delivered in
connection herewith or therewith, and each and every right allowed it by law
or equity, shall be cumulative and may be exercised from time to time. The
failure of any party at any time or times to require performance of any
provision hereof shall in no manner affect such party's right at a later time
to enforce the same. No waiver by any party of a condition or of the breach of
any term, agreement, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances shall
be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such
condition or breach or a waiver of any other condition or of the breach of any
other term, agreement, covenant, representation or warranty of this Agreement.





(b)This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Subject to the foregoing, this
Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by the board of
directors of Parent and the board of directors of the Company at any time
before or after the approval of the Company Shareholder Matters by the
requisite votes of the holders of the Company Common Stock or the approval of
the Parent Common Stock Issuance by the requisite vote of the holders of
Parent Common Stock; provided, however, no amendment shall be made after the
receipt of such approval which by law requires further approval of the
shareholders of the Company unless such further approval is obtained;
provided, further, Parent and the Company may without approval of their
respective boards of directors, make such technical changes to this Agreement,
not inconsistent with the purposes hereof, as may be required to effect or
facilitate any Requisite Regulatory Approvals or acceptance of the Merger or
of this Agreement or to effect or facilitate any filing or recording required
for the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

9.5Alternative Structure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, before the Effective Time, Parent, subject to the approval of the
Board of Directors of the Company, may revise the structure of the Merger or
otherwise revise the method of effecting the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby, provided that (a) such revision does not alter or change
the kind, amount or economic value of consideration to be delivered to
shareholders of the Company, (b) such revision does not adversely affect the
tax consequences to the shareholders of the Company, (c) such revised
structure or method is reasonably capable of consummation without significant
delay in relation to the structure contemplated herein and (d) such revision
does not otherwise cause, and could not reasonably be expected to cause, any
of the conditions set forth in Article 7 not to be capable of being fulfilled
(unless duly waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof). This
Agreement and any related documents will be appropriately amended in
accordance with the terms hereof or thereof in order to reflect any such
revised structure or method.

9.6Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be
performed entirely within that State.

9.7Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND

AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (b) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (c) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (d) EACH PARTY HAS





BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.7.

9.8Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement, the
other agreements and documents contemplated hereby and the Confidentiality
Agreement represent the entire understanding of the parties hereto regarding
the transactions contemplated hereby and supersede any and all other oral or
written agreements previously made or purported to be made. Except for Section
6.11, which is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties to the extent
stated, nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended to confer
any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities upon any person other than
the Company and Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything
in the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto hereby
agree that the execution and delivery of this Agreement does not result in the
termination of the Confidentiality Agreement, which remains in full force and
effect in accordance with the terms thereof.

9.9Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, and
may be delivered by means of facsimile or email (or any other electronic means
such as ".pdf" or ".tiff" files), each of which shall be deemed to constitute
an original, but all of which together shall be deemed to constitute one and
the same instrument.

9.10Severability. Each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in
such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but in case any
one or more provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (a) all other
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the transaction
contemplated hereby is not affected in a manner materially adverse to any
party and (b) the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby can be consummated as originally contemplated to the
greatest extent possible.

9.11Subsidiary and Affiliate Action. Wherever a party has an obligation under
this Agreement to "cause" a Subsidiary or Affiliate of such party or any such
Subsidiary's or Affiliate's officers, directors, management or employees to
take, or refrain from taking, any action, or such action that may be necessary
to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, such obligation of such party
shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of such party to cause
such Subsidiary or Affiliate to take such necessary action. Wherever this
Agreement provides that a Subsidiary or Affiliate of a party has an obligation
to act or refrain from taking any action, such party shall be deemed to have
an obligation under this Agreement to cause such Subsidiary or Affiliate, or
any such Subsidiary's or Affiliate's officers, directors, management or
employees, to take, or refrain from taking, any action, or such action as may
be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement. To the extent
necessary or appropriate to give meaning or effect to the provisions of this
Agreement or to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, Parent and the
Company, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have an obligation under this
Agreement to cause any Subsidiary thereof to take, or refrain from taking, any
action, and to cause such Subsidiary's officers, directors, management or
employees, to take, or refrain from taking, any action otherwise contemplated
herein. Any failure by an Affiliate of Parent or





the Company to act or refrain from taking any action contemplated by this
Agreement shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Parent or the
Company, respectively.

9.12Other Remedies; Specific Performance. Except as otherwise provided herein,
any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of
the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

9.13Assignment. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent
of the other parties hereto and any purported assignment in contravention
hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be executed by
their duly authorized officers as of the day and year first above written.
