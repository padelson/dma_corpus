2. Buyer desires to buy, and Sellers desire to sell, the Securities on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

  

Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, Buyer, Sellers and
Sellers Representative hereby agree as follows:

  

 **ARTICLE 1**

  

 **Defined Terms**

  

1.1 _Definitions_. Certain terms used in this Agreement shall have the
meanings set forth in Article 11 or elsewhere herein as indicated in Article
11.

  

1.2 _Accounting Terms_. Accounting terms used in this Agreement and not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings attributed to them
under GAAP except as may otherwise be specified herein.     

 **ARTICLE 2**

  

 **Purchase and Sale**

  

2.1 _Purchase and Sale_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Closing each Seller shall sell, assign, transfer and
deliver to Buyer, free and clear of all Liens, and Buyer shall purchase from
each Seller, all of such Sellers right, title and interest in and to all of
the Securities owned by such Seller, as more specifically identified on
_Schedule 4.2.1_ (as to each Seller, respectively, the " _Seller s
Respective Securities_").

  

2.2 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for all of the Securities
(the " _Purchase Price_ ") shall be an amount equal to:

  

(a) One Hundred Nineteen Million Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars
($119,800,000) (the " _Enterprise_ _Value_ ");

  

(b) _plus_  an amount equal to the Closing Cash (which amount may be a
negative amount);

  

(c) _minus_  an amount equal to the Closing Indebtedness;

  

(d) _plus_  the amount, if any, by which the Closing Working Capital (as
defined in Section 2.3.2) exceeds the Working Capital Target (as defined
in Section 2.3.3), or _minus_ the amount, if any, by which the
Working Capital Target exceeds the Closing Working Capital; and

  

(e) _minus_ an amount equal to the Company Transaction Expenses set forth on
the Company Transaction Expenses Statement.

  

2.3 _Certain Definitions_.

  

2.3.1 _Working Capital_. " _Working Capital_ " of the Acquired Companies is
defined on _Schedule 2.3.1_ , and shall be determined in accordance with
_Schedule 2.3.1_ and Section 2.5.1.

  

2.3.2 _Closing Working Capital_. " _Closing Working Capital_ " means the
Working Capital of the Acquired Companies, determined on a consolidated basis
as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date, as reflected on the Final Adjustment
Statement.

  

2.3.3 _Working Capital Target_. " _Working Capital Target_ " means
the average of the six (6) different amounts of the working capital of the
Company and its Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis from the
consolidated monthly balance sheet for each of the six (6) fiscal months of
the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to Closing, provided that for each
monthly balance sheet the working capital of the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall be determined on a consolidated basis as though each such date were the
Closing Date utililizing the same formula and method used in determining the
Closing Working Capital (i.e., by including and excluding the same assets and
liabilities in the calculation thereof and determining such amount in
accordance with _Schedule 2.3.1_ and Section 2.5.1), except that no physical
inventory shall be taken with respect to the inventory reflected in such
monthly balance sheets.

        

2.4 _Estimated Purchase Price and Manner of Payment_.

  

2.4.1 _Estimated Purchase Price_. No later than three (3) Business Days
before the Closing, Sellers Representative, on behalf of all Sellers, and
Buyer shall make a good faith estimate of the Closing Cash, the Closing
Indebtedness and the Closing Working Capital, respectively, as of the Closing
in accordance with Section 2.5.1 based upon the most recent ascertainable
financial information available, and shall execute a certificate setting
forth such estimates (the " _Closing Certificate_ "). As used herein, "
_Estimated Closing Cash_ ," " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ " and "
_Estimated Closing Working Capital_ " mean the estimates of the Closing Cash,
the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Working Capital, respectively, set
forth in the Closing Certificate, and " _Estimated Purchase Price_ " means
an amount equal to the Purchase Price calculated as set forth in Section 2.2,
assuming for purposes of such calculation that the Closing Cash is equal to
the Estimated Closing Cash, that the Closing Indebtedness is equal to the
Estimated Closing Indebtedness and that the Closing Working Capital is equal
to the Estimated Closing Working Capital.

  

2.4.2 _Payments to Escrow Agent and Sellers  Representative_. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer shall (a) pay
the Escrowed Funds to the Escrow Agent; (b) pay and deliver the Estimated
Purchase Price less the Escrowed Funds (such amount, the " _Closing Date
Payment_ ") to Sellers Representative (for further distribution to the
Sellers in accordance with the allocation set forth on _Schedule 2.6_ )
immediately available cash funds by means of a wire transfer to an account or
accounts as directed by Sellers Representative not later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing (the " _Sellers  Representatives
Account_").

  

2.4.3 _Payment of Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies_. Buyer will
pay, or cause to be paid, in full at or immediately following the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, the Estimated Closing Indebtedness as of the
Closing Date of the Acquired Companies. In order to facilitate such
repayment, no later than three (3) Business Days before the Closing, Sellers
Representative shall cause the Acquired Companies to obtain payoff letters
for the repayment of such Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies, which
payoff letters will be in a commercially reasonable form reasonably
acceptable to Buyer and Buyers lenders and shall indicate that the Acquired
Companies lenders have agreed to release immediately all applicable Liens
relating to the assets and properties of the Acquired Companies, including
the redelivery of all stock certificates held pursuant to any such terminated
stock pledge agreements (collectively, the " _Pay-Off Documents_ ").

  

2.4.4 _Payment of Company Transaction Expenses_. Buyer will pay, or cause to
be paid, in full at the Closing, the Company Transaction Expenses as
set forth on the Company Transaction Expense Statement in accordance with
the instructions provided in the Company Transaction Expense Statement. In
order to facilitate such payment, no later than three (3) Business Days
before the Closing, Sellers Representative shall provide Buyer with a true,
complete and correct list (the " _Company Transaction Expense Statement_ ")
of the amount of the unpaid fees, expenses and other similar amounts arising
from the provision of services prior to the Closing that have been or are
expected to be incurred on or prior to the Closing Date on behalf of the
Acquired Companies or any Seller in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any investment banking,
accounting, advisory,

        

brokers, finders, escrow agent or legal fees or fees paid to any Governmental
Authority or other Person (collectively, the " _Company Transaction Expenses_
"), and the name of the Persons to whom such payments are to be made and
wiring instructions for the recipients of such payments.

  

2.5 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

  

2.5.1 _Adjustment Statement Preparation_. Within sixty days (60) after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall use its best commercial efforts to cause to be
prepared and delivered to Sellers Representative, on behalf of Sellers, (a)
a consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of 12:01 a.m. on
the Closing Date, prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis
consistent with the GAAP Financial Statements and in accordance with
_Schedule 2.3.1_ (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), (b) a statement based on
such balance sheet setting forth the amount of the Closing Cash, the Closing
Indebtedness and the Closing Working Capital of the Acquired Companies, on a
consolidated basis, respectively, as of the Closing (the "
_Preliminary Adjustment Statement_ ") and, (c) based on the Closing Cash,
the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Working Capital reflected on
the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, Buyers written calculation of the
Purchase Price, and the adjustment necessary to reconcile the Estimated
Purchase Price to the Purchase Price (" _Preliminary Post-
Closing Adjustment_ "). In preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement: (a) any and all effects on the assets or
liabilities of any of the Acquired Companies of any financing or refinancing
arrangements entered into by Buyer at any time at or after the Closing Date
or any other transactions entered into by any of Sellers, Sellers
Representative, Buyer, or the Acquired Companies in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be entirely
disregarded; (b) it shall be assumed that the Acquired Companies and their
respective lines of business shall be continued as a going concern; and (c)
there shall not be taken into account any of the plans, transactions or
changes that Buyer intends to initiate or make or cause to be initiated or
made at or after the Closing Date with respect to any of the Acquired
Companies or their respective business or assets, or any facts
or circumstances that are unique or particular to Buyer or any assets
or liabilities of Buyer, or any obligation for the payment of the Closing
Purchase Price hereunder. Sellers and the Company shall, at Sellers
expense, cause the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 to be audited
in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the GAAP
Financial Statements and shall use their best commercial efforts to provide
such 2007 audited balance sheet to Buyer no less than fifteen (15) days prior
to the date that Buyer is required to deliver the Closing Balance Sheet to
the Sellers Representative; it being understood that the Buyers obligation
to deliver to the Sellers Representative the Closing Balance Sheet,
Preliminary Adjustment Statement and Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment
within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date shall be extended to the date
that is fifteen (15) days after such 2007 audited balance sheet is provided
to Buyer.

  

2.5.2 _Adjustment Statement Review_. Sellers Representative shall review
the Closing Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the
Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment and, if Sellers Representative
reasonably believes that any of them was not prepared in accordance with this
Agreement, Sellers Representative shall so notify Buyer in writing no later
than thirty (30) days after Sellers Representatives receipt thereof,
setting forth in such notice Sellers Representatives objection or
objections to the Closing Balance Sheet, Preliminary Adjustment Statement or
the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment with particularity

        

and the specific changes or adjustments that Sellers Representative claims
are required to be made thereto in order to conform the same to the terms of
this Agreement.  Buyer and Sellers shall each make readily available to the
other all of their relevant work papers and books and records relating to the
Acquired Companies, the Closing Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Adjustment
Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment as are requested by
Buyer or Sellers and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with each other in resolving any disputed matters. Any notice of objection
delivered pursuant to this Section 2.5.2 shall specify in reasonable detail
the nature of any disagreement so asserted.

  

2.5.3 _Adjustment Statement Dispute Resolution_. If Sellers Representative
notifies Buyer of an objection to the Closing Balance Sheet, the Preliminary
Adjustment Statement or the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment pursuant to
Section 2.5.2, and if Buyer and Sellers Representative are unable to resolve
such dispute through good faith negotiations within thirty (30) days after
Sellers Representatives delivery of such written notice of objection, then,
the parties shall mutually engage and submit such dispute to, and the same
shall be finally resolved in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement
by the Cleveland office of Deloitte and Touche USA LLP (the "
_Independent Accountants_ "). The Independent Accountants shall determine
and report in writing to Buyer and Sellers Representative as to the
resolution of all disputed matters submitted to the Independent Accountants
and the effect of such determinations on the Closing Balance Sheet, the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment
within thirty (30) days after such submission or such longer period as the
Independent Accountants may reasonably require. Such determinations shall be
final, binding and conclusive as to Buyer, Sellers, Sellers Representative
and their respective Affiliates. Buyer and Sellers shall each make readily
available to the Independent Accountants all relevant work papers and books
and records relating to the Acquired Companies, the Closing Balance Sheet,
the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing
Adjustment as are requested by the Independent Accountants and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Independent Accountants
in resolving any disputed matters.  The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountants shall be allocated between the Sellers and the Buyer so that the
Sellers share of such fees and expenses shall be equal to the product of (A)
and (B), where (A) is the aggregate amount of such fees and expenses and
where (B) is a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount in dispute that
is ultimately unsuccessfully disputed by the Sellers (as determined by the
Independent Accountants) and the denominator of which is the total amount of
such disputed items so submitted.

  

2.5.4 _Final Adjustment Statement and Post-Closing Adjustment_. The
Closing Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the
Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment shall become the " _Final Closing Balance
Sheet_ ", the " _Final Adjustment Statement_ " and the " _Final Post-Closing
Adjustment_ ," respectively, and as such shall become final, binding and
conclusive upon Buyer, Sellers, Sellers Representative and their respective
Affiliates for all purposes of this Agreement, upon the earliest to occur of
the following:

  

(a) the mutual acceptance by Buyer and Sellers Representative of the Closing
Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-
Closing Adjustment, respectively, with such changes or adjustments thereto,
if any, as may be proposed by Sellers Representative and consented to by
Buyer;

        

(b) the expiration of thirty (30) days after Sellers Representatives
receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Adjustment Statement
and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment, respectively, without timely
written objection thereto by Sellers Representative in accordance with
Section 2.5.2; or

  

(c) the delivery to Buyer and Sellers Representative by the Independent
Accountants of the report of their determination of all disputed matters
submitted to them pursuant to Section 2.5.3 together with revisions of the
Closing Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the
Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment.

  

2.5.5 _Adjustment of Closing Purchase Price_. If the Purchase Price _minus_
the Estimated Purchase Price is a positive number, then (a) Buyer and
Sellers Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds to Sellers Representative (for
further distribution to the Sellers in accordance with the allocations set
forth on _Schedule 2.6_ ) and (b) Buyer shall pay the amount of the Final
Post-Closing Adjustment to Sellers Representative (for further distribution
to the Sellers in accordance with the allocation set forth on _Schedule
2.6)_. If the Purchase Price _minus_ the Estimated Purchase Price is a
negative number, then (a) if the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds
exceed the amount of the Final Post-Closing Adjustment _plus_  the Interest
Amount, then Buyer and Sellers Representative shall jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent (i) to pay such excess to Sellers Representative and (ii) to
pay the remainder of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds to Buyer, and
(b) if the amount of the Final Post-Closing Adjustment _plus_ the Interest
Amount exceeds the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds, then Buyer and
Sellers Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay
the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds to Buyer, and Sellers, shall be
ratably liable in accordance with the allocations set forth on _Schedule 2.6_
to pay, and hereby agree to pay when due, the amount of such excess to Buyer.
Payments to Sellers Representative pursuant to this Section 2.5.5 shall be
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Sellers
Representatives Account (for further distribution to the Sellers), and
payments to Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.5.5 shall be by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer. Payments
pursuant to this Section 2.5.5 shall be made no later than seven (7) Business
Days after the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-
Closing Adjustment become the Final Adjustment Statement and the Final Post-
Closing Adjustment, respectively, pursuant to Section 2.5.4.
Payments pursuant to this Section 2.5.5 shall be made together with an amount
equal to the equivalent of interest thereon (the " _Interest Amount_ ") at a
rate equal to eight percent (8%) per annum for the period from the Closing
Date to the date of the payment calculated on the basis of a 365-day year and
the actual number of days elapsed. For Tax purposes, any payment by Buyer or
Sellers under this Agreement, including pursuant to Article 10, shall be

2.6 _Allocation to Sellers of the Purchase Price_. The payment by Buyer of
the Purchase Price (including any additional amount required pursuant
to Section 2.5.5) into the Sellers Representatives Account shall
constitute payment by Buyer to each Seller and satisfaction of Buyers
obligation to pay such amount hereunder and Buyer shall have no further
liability with respect thereto. After such payment by Buyer, Sellers
Representative shall be solely responsible for allocating and distributing to
each Seller such Sellers share of the Purchase Price from the Sellers
Representatives Account. The Purchase Price and any

        

collective obligations of Sellers, including payment of transaction fees and
expenses, shall be allocated among Sellers in accordance with _Schedule
2.6_. The portion of the Purchase Price allocated to each Seller (net of
obligations and any reserves or holdbacks established pursuant to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, or by Sellers Representative in its sole
discretion) shall be paid and distributed to such Seller by
Sellers Representative prior to, on, or after the Closing. At the Closing,
Sellers agree that Sellers Representative may withhold from the proceeds
otherwise distributable to each Seller hereunder, and pay, such Sellers pro-
rata portion of any fees or expenses incurred by or on behalf of Sellers in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.  Nothing in this
Section 2.6 is intended or shall be construed to confer on any Seller any
rights against Buyer in respect of the portion of the Purchase Price
allocated to such Seller or the net proceeds received after delivery of same
into the Sellers Representatives Account.

  

2.7 _Escrow_. At the Closing, Buyer, Sellers Representative and JPMorgan
Trust Company, National Association (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") shall enter into
an escrow agreement, substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Ten Million Two Hundred Twenty-Five
Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($10,225,000.00) of the Estimated Purchase Price
(the " _Escrowed Funds_ ") shall be deposited into escrow for the purpose of
securing (a) the purchase price adjustment obligations of Sellers under
Section 2.5 of this Agreement, and (b) the indemnification obligations of the
Sellers under Article 10 of this Agreement. The Escrowed Funds shall
be divided into two separate subaccounts as follows: (a) the sum of
Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) shall constitute the
subaccount maintained to secure the purchase price adjustment obligations of
the Sellers (the " _Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds_ "); and (b) the
sum of Seven Million Seven Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand and 00/100 Dollars
($7,725,000.00) shall constitute the subaccount maintained to secure the

during the Pre-Closing Period, without the prior written consent of Buyer
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Company
shall not and shall not permit any of the Subsidiaries to, take, or agree
(whether in writing or otherwise) to take, any action that (a) would cause a
material breach of any Contract, commitment or covenant of Sellers contained
in this Agreement, (b) would cause the representations and warranties set

or (c) would result in a breach of Section 4.5 hereof.  Further, during the

Agreement. Neither the Company and Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on
the other hand,

        

shall intentionally perform any act which, if performed, or intentionally
omit to perform any act which, if omitted to be performed, would prevent or

Date. The parties shall cooperate with each other so as to obtain as soon as
practicable after the date hereof all necessary regulatory or other consents,
clearances, authorizations and approvals required under Article 6, and during

the terms thereof and shall be binding upon Buyer.

  

8.1.5 _Termination of Stockholders Agreements_. With respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each Seller hereby waives

Agreements hereby covenants and agrees with the other Sellers, the Acquired
Companies and Buyer that, effective immediately upon the Closing, each
Stockholders Agreement shall terminate and be deemed cancelled in its
entirety, and each Seller unconditionally and forever releases and discharges
each other party to the Stockholders Agreements from all obligations and
liabilities arising thereunder.  The foregoing termination of the

cause each of the Acquired Companies to, for a period of three (3) years
after the Closing Date, during normal business hours, provide Sellers

business of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date as may be
reasonably requested by Sellers Representative, who shall be entitled, at
its expense, to make extracts and copies of such books and records. The

(60) days after the Closing Date, it will not cause any of the employees of

under the WARN Act in such a manner and at such time that Sellers bear no
liability with respect thereto.

  

8.2.3 _Employee Matters_.

  

(a) Each Person who is as of the Closing Date an employee of the Acquired
Companies shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Acquired Companies before the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility and
vesting under the employee benefit plans of Buyer or its Affiliates, if any,
in which such employee participates after the Closing (such plans,
collectively, the " _New Plans_ ") and for purposes of any applicable
vacation, paid time off or severance policy, except to the extent such credit
would result in a duplication of benefits or was not recognized under the
applicable Benefit Plan of the Acquired Company (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ ") **. **In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any such employee, Buyer shall cause all
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents
except to the extent any such Person has not satisfied any corresponding
exclusions or requirements under the applicable Old Plan. Buyer shall cause
any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all

        

deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.  Nothing
contained herein shall entitle any Person who is, as of the Closing Date, an
employee of the Acquired Companies to participate in the New Plans.

  

(b) The Company currently provides certain of its employees the use of a
vehicle.  The vehicles provided to such employees are leased by the
Company pursuant to a lease arrangement with Bud Behling Leasing, Inc. The
lease arrangement pursuant to which the Company leases such vehicles shall be

respect to such employee use vehicles shall be terminated. The Acquired
Companies will continue to lease the vehicles set forth on _Schedule
8.2.3(b)(i)_ in accordance with the terms of the current lease with Bud
Behling Leasing, Inc., and the amount of such lease obligation shall not be
considered Indebtedness pursuant to this Agreement. The current program for
providing certain of its employees with vehicles leased by the Company will
be terminated effective on the Closing Date. In accordance with Buyers
policies, promptly following the Closing, the Company will provide such
employees with a vehicle allowance consistent with the vehicle allowance
program set forth on _Schedule 8.2.3(b)(ii)_.

  

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Acquired Companies shall assign the life and

share of such Taxes pursuant to Section 10.6. Buyer shall file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns for Taxes with respect to Straddle Periods and shall
remit or cause to be remitted the amount of Taxes shown on such Tax Returns
subject to Sellers obligation to pay its share of such Taxes pursuant to
Section 10.6. Buyer shall provide Sellers Representative with a copy of any
Tax Return described in this Section 8.2.4 proposed to be filed at least
thirty (30) days before the proposed dates of filing and such filing shall be
subject to the consent of Sellers Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for any
Taxes which are payable with Tax Returns to be filed by Buyer pursuant to
this Section 8.2.4 that Seller is obligated to pay pursuant to Section 10.6
not later than five (5) days prior to the date that such returns are due.
Buyer and Sellers agree to cause the Acquired Companies to file all Tax
Returns for the periods including the Closing Date on the basis that the
relevant Tax Period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date
unless the relevant Tax Authority will not accept a Tax Return filed on that
basis.

  

(b) Sellers and Buyer shall, and Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to,
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any other
party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any filing, audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes, including any Tax
Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon any other
partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees

        

available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at any
proceeding. Sellers and Buyer agree, and Buyer agrees to cause the Acquired
Companies, (i) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
relating to the Acquired Companies for any taxable period beginning before
the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to
the extent notified by Buyer or Sellers Representative, any extensions
thereof) for the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention Contracts entered into with any Tax Authority, and (ii) to give the
other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests,
Sellers and Buyer shall, and Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to,
allow the other party to take possession of such books and records. Buyer and
Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain any certificate or other document from any Tax Authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

  

(c) The amount or economic benefit of any refunds of Taxes of the Acquired
Companies for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date shall
be for the account of Sellers, and Buyer agrees to provide prompt notice of
any such event to Sellers Representative. The amount or economic benefit of
any refunds of Taxes of the Acquired Companies for any taxable period
beginning after the Closing Date (including any refund of Taxes relating to
the carry back of net operating loss from a Post-Closing Tax Period to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period) shall be for the account of Buyer. The amount or
economic benefit of any refunds of Taxes of the Acquired Companies for any
Straddle Period shall be apportioned between Sellers and Buyer in the manner
described in Section 10.6. Any such amounts owing to Sellers or Buyer, as
applicable, as provided in this Section 8.2.4(c) shall be paid by Buyer or
Sellers, as applicable, within ten (10) days of the receipt of any such
refunds.

  

(d) Sellers shall cause the provisions of any Tax sharing Contract or similar
arrangement with respect to or involving the Acquired Companies to be
terminated on or before the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, no party
shall have any rights or obligations under any such Tax sharing Contract.

  

8.2.5 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing, as and when required
by any party, each party will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all such documents and instruments and will take, or cause to
be taken, at the requesting partys expense, all such further or
other actions, as such other party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 9.1(a), then all provisions of this Agreement except Section
12.14 shall thereupon become void without any liability on the part of any
party hereto to any other party hereto. If this Agreement is terminated other
than pursuant to Section 9.1(a), such termination will not affect any right
or remedy which accrued hereunder or under applicable Laws prior to or on
account of such termination, and the provisions of this Agreement shall

10.2 _Limitations on Indemnification of Buyer_. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, the indemnification of Buyer Indemnitees
provided for in this Agreement shall be subject to the limitations and

agreements in this Agreement to be performed by the Sellers or, on or prior
to the Closing, the Acquired Companies (other than those set forth in Section
10.6 (Tax Indemnification)), (II) any of the representations or warranties

of, or caused by, the indemnification obligations set forth in Section 10.6
(Tax Indemnification) or the covenants set forth in Section 8.2.4 (Tax
Matters) of this Agreement or a breach of any representation or warranty set
forth in Section 4.6 (Taxes).

  

(b) The Sellers shall not be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees
hereunder with respect to Claims for any Losses under this Article 10 except
to the extent that the aggregate amount of Losses for which the Buyer
Indemnitees are otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Article 10 exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the "
_Deductible Amount_ ") (it being understood and agreed that the Deductible
Amount is intended as a deductible, and the Sellers shall not be liable for
any Losses included in the Deductible Amount for which the Buyer Indemnitees
are otherwise entitled to indemnification).  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Article 10, the Deductible Amount shall not apply to any
Losses based upon, related to, arising out of, or caused by any Special
Claims or

        

Tax Claims (and any Losses based upon, related to, arising out of, or caused
by Special Claims or Tax Claims shall not apply against the Deductible
Amount).

  

(c) The aggregate liability of the Sellers pursuant to this Article 10 with
respect to all Claims for indemnification (other than Claims based upon,
related to, arising out of, or caused by Special Claims and Tax Claims) shall
not exceed an amount equal to Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) (the "
_Maximum Amount_ "), and the maximum liability of any Seller pursuant to this
Article 10 with respect to all Claims for indemnification (other than Claims
based upon, related to, arising out of, or caused by Special Claims and Tax
Claims) shall not exceed an amount equal to the Maximum Amount _multiplied_
_by_ such Sellers prorata share of such Losses based upon the allocation
percentage set forth in _Section 2.6_.

  

(d) The maximum liability of any Seller with respect to Claims under this
Article 10, including Special Claims and Tax Claims, shall not exceed an
amount equal to the Enterprise Value  _multiplied_ _by_ such Sellers prorata
share of such Losses based upon the allocation percentage set forth in
_Section 2.6_.

  

(e) Each of the representations and warranties of the Sellers contained in
this Agreement shall irrevocably expire on the last day on which any Claim
for breach of such representation or warranty may be brought or asserted
pursuant to this Article 10 (the " _Expiration Date_ "); provided that if
written notice of a Claim for Losses has been given to the Sellers
Representative prior to the expiration of the applicable Expiration Date for
such Claim, then the representation and warranties shall survive as to such
action or Claim until such Claim has been fully resolved. No Claim for Losses
pursuant to this Article 10, other than with respect to Special Claims and
Tax Claims, shall be brought or asserted after the twenty-four (24) month
anniversary of the Closing Date. No Tax Claims shall be brought or asserted
after the date that is thirty (30) days following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations applicable to the Taxes that are the
subject of the indemnification Claim. For the sake of clarity, liability for
Losses with respect to Special Claims shall not expire and Claims for
indemnification with respect to such Special Claims may be brought at any
time following the Closing.

  

(f) Any Claims for indemnification under this Article 10 shall be net of any
Tax benefit actually realized (by reason of a Tax deduction or credit, basis
increase, shifting of income, or otherwise) by any Buyer Indemnitee in
connection with the Losses that form the basis of the Buyer Indemnitees
Claim for indemnification hereunder.

  

(g) Any Claim for indemnification under this Article 10 shall be net of any
insurance proceeds or other amounts received by the Buyer Indemnitees from
third parties with respect to the event giving rise to such indemnification
obligation.

  

(h) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under this
Article 10 if, and to the extent that, Buyer shall have received the benefit
of an adjustment pursuant to Article 2 hereof due to the fact that the item
that is the subject of the Indemnification Claim was specifically taken into
account in the final determination of Closing Working Capital.

  

(i) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under this
Article 10 with respect to Claims pursuant to the Asbestos Indemnity for the
first Seventy-Five

        

Thousand Dollars ($75,000) **** of attorneys fees and other legal expenses
incurred to defend Third Party Claims against the Acquired Companies based
upon, related to, arising out of or caused by the sale or distribution or
alleged sale or distribution by the Acquired Companies of products containing
asbestos.

  

10.3 _Indemnification of Sellers_. From and after the Closing and subject
to this Section 10.3 and Sections 10.4 and 10.5, Buyer shall indemnify
Sellers and their successors and assigns and each of the foregoings
respective shareholders, officers, directors, employees and agents
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ "), against and hold the Seller
Indemnitees harmless from any Losses based upon, related to, arising out of,
or caused by (a) any breach of, any of the representations and
warranties made by Buyer in Article 5; (b) the breach by Buyer of any
covenant or agreement by Buyer contained in this Agreement or any Closing
document. Any Claims for indemnification under this Section 10.3 shall be net
of any Tax benefit actually realized (by reason of a Tax deduction or credit,
basis increase, shifting of income, or otherwise) by any Buyer Indemnitee in
connection with the Losses that form the basis of the Seller Indemnitees
Claim for indemnification hereunder. Any Claim for indemnification under
this Section 10.3 shall be net of any insurance proceeds or other amounts
received by the Seller Indemnitees from third parties with respect to the
event giving rise to such indemnification obligation.  The Seller
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 10.3
if, and to the extent that, Sellers shall have received the benefit of an
adjustment pursuant to Article 2 hereof due to the fact that the item that is
the subject of the Indemnification Claim was specifically taken into account
in the final determination of Closing Working Capital.

  

10.4 _Third Party Claims_. This Section 10.4 shall not apply to
Tax Proceedings, which are covered by the provisions of Section 10.6. In
order for a party (the " _indemnitee_ ") to be entitled to
any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising
out of, or involving a Claim made by any Person against the indemnitee (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), such indemnitee must notify the party from
whom indemnification hereunder is sought (the " _indemnitor_ ") in writing
of the Third-Party Claim no later than thirty (30) days after such Claim is
first asserted. Such notice (to the extent known) shall state in reasonable
detail the amount or estimated amount of such Claim, and shall identify the
specific basis (or bases) for such Claim, including the representations,
warranties or covenants in this Agreement alleged to have been breached.
Failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnitor shall have been
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.  Thereafter, the indemnitee
shall deliver to the indemnitor, without undue delay, copies of all notices
and documents (including court papers received by the indemnitee) relating to
the Third-Party Claim so long as any such disclosure could not reasonably be
expected to have an adverse effect on the attorney-client or any other
privilege that may be available to the indemnitee in connection therewith. If
a Third-Party Claim is made against an indemnitee, the indemnitor shall
be entitled to assume and control the defense thereof with counsel selected
by the indemnitor, provided, that the indemnitor shall acknowledge in writing
and without qualification its indemnification obligations hereunder with
respect to such Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days of the receipt of
notice of such Claim. If the indemnitor assumes such defense, the indemnitee
shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
indemnitor, it being understood that the indemnitor shall control such
defense. If the indemnitor shall not assume the defense of any Third Party
Claim or litigation resulting therefrom, the indemnitee may defend

        

against such Claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate and may settle
such Claim or litigation on such terms as it may deem appropriate. In the
event the indemnitee is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense
against any such Third Party Claim, the indemnitor shall cooperate with the
indemnitee in such defense and make available to the indemnitee, all such
witnesses, records, materials and information in the indemnitors possession
or under the indemnitors control relating thereto as is reasonably required
by the indemnitee. If the indemnitor so assumes the defense of any Third-
Party Claim, all of the indemnitees shall reasonably cooperate with the
indemnitor in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall
include, at the expense of the indemnitor, the retention and (upon the
indemnitors request) the provision to the indemnitor of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. If
the indemnitor has assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the indemnitor
shall not, without the written consent of the indemnitee, enter into any
settlement, compromise or discharge or consent to the entry of any judgment
which imposes any equitable remedies or material obligations or restrictions
upon the indemnitee and which does not include an unconditional written
release from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim.

  

10.5 _Limitation of Remedies_. Each party acknowledges and agrees
that, should the Closing occur, the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any and all Claims relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than Claims of, or causes of action arising from,
or based upon, fraud or intentional misrepresentation, or Claims arising from
the Non-Compete Agreements or Lease Agreements) shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article 10.

  

10.6 _Tax Indemnification_.

  

(a) From and after the Closing, except for Taxes accrued or reserved for and
specifically identified as such in the Final Closing Balance Sheet and which
can be determined to be accrued or reserved with respect to the item for
which indemnification is sought hereunder and taken into account in the Final
Adjustment Statement and in the determination of the Final Post-Closing
Adjustment, the Sellers shall indemnify, save and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnitees from and against (collectively, " _Seller Taxes_ ") (i) all
liability for Taxes of the Acquired Companies for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods, (ii) any and all damages arising out of, resulting from or incident
to any breach by the Sellers of any covenant contained in Section 8.2.4,
(iii) any increase in Tax liability for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Post-
Closing Tax Period imposed on the Acquired Companies due to the application
of Code Section 280G to any payments made by an Acquired Company, and (iv)
all liability (as a result of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) or a
comparable state or local Tax provision) for Taxes of any Person which is or
has been an Affiliate of the Acquired Companies during a Pre-Closing Tax
Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers shall not be liable for or
pay and shall not indemnify, defend, save or hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnitees for any Taxes (collectively, " _Excluded Taxes_ ") imposed on the
Acquired Companies as a result of the transactions occurring on or prior to
the Closing Date that are properly allocable (based on, among other relevant
factors, factors set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)) to
periods after the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, all items paid
by the Company on the Closing Date shall be deemed to have been paid by the
Company during the final Pre-Closing Tax Period.

        

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, save and hold harmless
the Sellers from and against (i) all liability for Taxes of the Acquired
Companies for any Post-Closing Tax Period and (ii) any and all damages
arising out of, resulting from or incident to the breach by Buyer of any
covenant contained in Section 8.2.4.

  

(c) In the case of any Straddle Period:

  

(i) real, personal and intangible property Taxes and any other Taxes levied
on a per diem basis (" _Per Diem Taxes_ ") of the Acquired Companies for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such Per Diem Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period _multiplied_ _by_  a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the
Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the total number of
days in the Straddle Period; and

  

(ii) the Taxes of the Acquired Companies (other than Per Diem Taxes) for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such Tax Period ended as of
the close of business on the Closing Date.

  

(d) Sellers indemnity obligations in respect of Seller Taxes, as determined
pursuant to Section 10.6(a), shall initially be effected by Sellers payment
to Buyer of the excess of (i) any such Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (as
may be evidenced by any Tax Return prepared by Buyer in accordance with
Section 8.2.4 or as otherwise indicated in a written notice prepared by Buyer
that is satisfactory to the Seller Representative) over (ii) the sum of (A)
the amount of such Taxes with respect to the Acquired Companies paid by
Sellers at any time, and (B) the amount of such Taxes paid by the Acquired
Companies on or prior to the Closing Date. Sellers shall pay such excess
to Buyer within twenty (20) days after written demand thereof is made by
Buyer (but not earlier than five (5) days before the date on which the Taxes
for the relevant Tax Period are required to be paid to the relevant
Taxing Authority). If the sum of (i) the amount of any Seller Taxes paid by
Sellers at any time and (ii) the amount of Seller Taxes paid by the Acquired
Companies on or prior to the Closing Date exceeds the amount of Seller Taxes,
Buyer shall pay to Sellers the amount of such excess within twenty (20) days
after the Tax Return with respect to the final liability for such Taxes is
required to be filed with the relevant Taxing Authority. In the case of a Tax
that is contested in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6(e),
payment of the Tax to the appropriate Taxing Authority shall not be
considered to be due earlier than the date a final determination to such
effect is made by the appropriate Taxing Authority or court.

  

(e) If a Claim shall be made by any Taxing Authority, which, if successful,
might result in an indemnity payment with respect to Tax Claims to an
indemnitee pursuant to this Article 10, the indemnitee shall promptly and in
any event no more than twenty (20) days following the indemnitees receipt of
such Claim, give written notice to the indemnitor of such Claim (a " _Tax
Proceeding_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , the failure of the indemnitee to
give such notices shall only relieve the indemnitor from its indemnification
obligations hereunder to the extent it is actually prejudiced by such
failure.  With respect to any Tax Proceeding relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, Sellers shall control all proceedings and may make all decisions
taken in connection with such Tax Proceeding (including selection of counsel)
at its own expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the resolution of any
portion of a Tax Proceeding would increase the

        

Taxes of the Acquired Companies for a Post-Closing Tax Period by more than
$50,000, Sellers shall give written notice to the Buyer, which shall be
entitled to jointly control only the proceedings taken solely in connection
with such portion of such Tax Proceeding. Sellers and Buyer shall jointly
control all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Proceeding relating
solely to Taxes of the Acquired Companies for a Straddle Period or any Tax
Proceeding involving both a Pre-Closing Tax Period and Post-Closing Tax
Period. Buyer shall control at its own expense all proceedings with respect
to any Tax Proceeding relating to a Post-Closing Tax Period, unless the Tax
Proceeding involves both a Pre-Closing Tax Period and a Post-Closing Tax
Period, in which case Sellers and Buyer shall jointly control such Tax
Proceeding. A party shall promptly notify the other party if it decides not
to control the defense or settlement of any Tax Proceeding which it is
entitled to control pursuant to this Agreement, and the other party shall
thereupon be permitted to defend and settle such proceeding without
prejudice.  No Tax Proceeding in which Sellers and the Buyer are entitled to
jointly control all proceedings may be settled without the written consent of
Buyer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Buyer,
Sellers, the Acquired Companies and each of their respective Affiliates shall
reasonably cooperate with each other in contesting any Tax Proceeding in
accordance with Section 8.2.4.

  

(f) The parties shall satisfy their indemnity obligations pursuant to this
Section 10.6 within ten (10) days after a final determination (within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code) of the relevant Tax is made.

  

10.7 _Release of Escrow Funds_.

  

(a) The indemnification obligations of the Sellers pursuant to Article 10,
subject to the limitations set forth in Section 10.2 to the extent
applicable, will be first satisfied from the Indemnity Escrow Funds until
such funds have been exhausted or the Claims for indemnification shall exceed

and/or in any case, to such other address for a party as to which notice
shall have been given to Buyer and Sellers Representative in accordance with
this Section.  Notices so addressed shall be deemed to have been duly given
(i) on the third Business Day after the day of registration, if sent by
registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, or (ii) on the next Business
Day following the documented acceptance thereof for next-day delivery by a
national overnight air courier service, if so sent.

  

12.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and
the schedules (including the Disclosure Schedule) and exhibits hereto and the
agreements, instruments, certificates and documents executed pursuant to this
Agreement constitute the exclusive statement of the agreement among Buyer and
each Seller concerning the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all
other prior agreements, oral or written, among or between any of the parties
hereto concerning such subject matter. All negotiations among or between any
of the parties hereto are superseded by this Agreement and the agreements,
instruments, certificates and documents executed pursuant to this Agreement,
and there are no representations, warranties, promises, understandings or
agreements, oral or written, in relation to the subject matter hereof among
or between any of the parties hereto other than those expressly set forth or
expressly incorporated herein.

  

12.3 _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by Buyer and Sellers Representative and,
prior to the Closing, the Company. In addition, any failure of a Person to
comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition contained herein
may be waived only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
party or parties to be bound by such waiver, but such waiver or failure to
insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
other failure.

  

12.4 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW
THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND
COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR
OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN

        

ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION
ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED TO, BASED ON, OR IN CONNECTION
WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT,
WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT OR
CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A
COPY OF THIS SECTION 12.4 WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT
OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

  

12.5 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement (or any portion
thereof) or the application of such provision (or any portion thereof) to any
Person or circumstance is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, all other terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated
to the greatest extent possible.

  

12.6 _Headings_. The article and section headings used in this Agreement are
intended solely for convenience of reference, do not themselves form a part
of this Agreement, and may not be given effect in the interpretation or
construction of this Agreement.

  

12.7 _Counterparts, Facsimile and Electronic Signatures_. This Agreement may
be executed and delivered in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument. A facsimile or other copy of a signature, including
execution and delivery of the Agreement by electronic exchange bearing the
copies of a partys signature, shall be deemed an original for purposes of
this Agreement.

  

12.8 _Third Parties_. Except as may otherwise be expressly stated herein, no
provision of this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to confer on
any Person, other than the parties hereto, any rights hereunder. Buyer
Indemnitees and Seller Indemnitees who are not otherwise parties to this
Agreement shall be third party beneficiaries of this Agreement.

  

12.9 _Schedules and Exhibits_. The schedules and exhibits (including
the Disclosure Schedule) referenced in this Agreement constitute an integral
part of this Agreement as if fully rewritten herein. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any of the Schedules,
any information disclosed in one Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed in
such other Schedules and applicable to such other representations and
warranties to the extent that the disclosure is clearly applicable on the
face of such item to such other Schedule and such other representations and
warranties. No disclosure in the Disclosure Schedule relating to any possible
breach or violation of any Contract or Law will be construed as an admission
or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred.

        

12.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
choice-of-laws or conflicts-of-laws provisions thereof.

  

12.11 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties acknowledges and
agrees that the other party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of
the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or otherwise are breached.  Accordingly, each of the
parties agrees that the other party will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any action instituted in any court having jurisdiction over the
parties and the matter (subject to the provisions set forth in Section 12.10
above), in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at law
or in equity.

  

12.12 _Sellers  Representative_. By execution and delivery of this
Agreement, each Seller hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints David A.
Moorhead as the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of such Seller
with full authority and power of substitution to act in the name, place and
stead of such Seller, its successors and assigns as Sellers Representative
with respect to all matters relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Sellers Representative is hereby authorized by each
Seller to execute any and all instruments or other documents on behalf of
such Seller, and to do any and all other acts or things on behalf of such
Seller, which Sellers Representative may deem necessary or advisable, or
which may be required pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and the
performance of all obligations hereunder before, at and following
the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sellers
Representative shall have the full and exclusive authority to (a) agree with
Buyer with respect to any matter or thing required or deemed necessary by
Sellers Representative in connection with the provisions of this Agreement
calling for the agreement of Sellers, give and receive notices on behalf of
all Sellers, and act on behalf of Sellers in connection with any matter as to
which Sellers are or may be obligated under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, all in the absolute discretion of Sellers Representative, (b) in
general, do all things and perform all acts, including executing and
delivering all agreements, certificates, receipts, consents, elections,
instructions, and other instruments or documents contemplated by, or deemed
by Sellers Representative to be necessary or advisable in connection with,
this Agreement, (c) to make all decisions relating to the determination of
any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement, (d) to
execute and deliver all amendments and waivers to this Agreement that the
Sellers Representative deems necessary or appropriate, whether prior to, at
or after the Closing, which amendments and waivers will be binding on the
Sellers, (e) take all actions necessary or desirable in connection with the
defense or settlement of any indemnification Claims pursuant to Article 10
and performance of obligations under Article 2, including to withhold funds
for satisfaction of expenses or other liabilities or obligations or to
withhold funds for potential indemnification Claims made hereunder, and (f)
retain and employ counsel, accountants, consultants and other professional
advisors with reference to the performance of the duties assigned with the
cost thereof allocated prorata among Sellers in accordance with the
percentages set forth in Schedule 2.6.  Sellers shall cooperate with Sellers
Representative and any accountants, attorneys or other agents whom it may
retain to assist in carrying out its duties hereunder. All decisions by
Sellers Representative shall be binding upon all Sellers, and no
Seller shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest
the same. Sellers Representative may communicate with any Seller or any
other Person concerning his responsibilities hereunder, but it is not
required to do so. Sellers Representative has a duty to serve in good faith
the interests of Sellers and to perform its designated role under this
Agreement, but Sellers Representative shall have no financial liability
whatsoever to any Person relating to its service hereunder (including any
action taken or omitted to be taken), except that it shall be liable for harm
which it directly causes by an act of willful misconduct. Sellers shall
indemnify and hold harmless Sellers

        

Representative against any loss, expense (including reasonable attorneys
fees) or other liability arising out of its service as Sellers
Representative under this Agreement, other than for harm directly caused by
an act of willful misconduct.  Sellers Representative may resign at any time
by notifying Buyer and Sellers in writing. Buyer shall be entitled
conclusively and absolutely to rely, without inquiry, upon any action of
Sellers Representative as the action of each Seller in all matters
referred to in this Section 12.12. In the event of the Incapacity, death or
resignation of David A. Moorhead, Fredric T. Pratt shall serve as the
successor Sellers Representative possessing all powers and authorities
granted to Sellers Representative hereunder and elsewhere. In the event of
the Incapacity, death or resignation of Fredric T. Pratt, David D. Lowery
shall serve as the successor Sellers Representative possessing all powers
and authorities granted to Sellers Representative hereunder and elsewhere.
The successor Sellers Representative is relieved of any responsibility to
inquire as to the actions or inactions of the prior Sellers Representative.
The successor Sellers Representative is entitled to rely on the accounts of
his predecessor or predecessors, as applicable.

  

12.13 _Release by the Sellers_. At the effective time of Closing, each
Seller (each a " _Releasor_ "), on behalf of such Seller and such
Sellers respective beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns irrevocably,
absolutely and fully releases, remises, relieves, relinquishes, waives and
forever discharges the Acquired Companies, and each of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, Affiliates, direct and indirect
equity holders, lenders, representatives, successors and assigns
(collectively, the " _Released Parties_ "), from any and all Claims,
counterclaims, damages, losses, payments, obligations, debts, accountings,
Liens, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and costs) of any kind
or nature, fixed or contingent, direct or indirect, several or otherwise,
known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, choate or inchoate, claimed or
unclaimed, in law or in equity, whether arising from, in or out of tort,
statute (whether state, federal or local) or Contract or any other
common law, administrative or similar cause of action, right or remedy
(collectively, the " _Released Claims_ "), that such Releasor may have
against any of the Released Parties from the beginning of time until the
effective time of Closing, other than rights under this Agreement and any
ancillary agreements. Such Releasor, on behalf of such Releasors respective
heirs, successors and assigns, specifically waives the benefits of any
statutory or common law of any state, which in effect provides that a general
release does not extend to Released Claims which the creditor does not know
or suspect to exist in his favor. It is expressly understood and agreed
that the releases contained in this Section 12.13 are intended to cover and
do cover all known facts and/or Released Claims, as well as any further facts
and/or Released Claims within the scope of such Released Claims not known
or anticipated, but which may later develop or be discovered, including all
the effects and consequences thereof. Such Releasor, on behalf of such
Releasors respective successors and assigns, acknowledge that they may
hereafter discover facts in addition to, or different from, those which they
now believe to be true with respect to the subject matter of the Released
Claims released in this Agreement, but agree that they have taken that
possibility into account in reaching this Agreement, and that the releases
given in this Agreement will be and remain in

        

effect notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any such additional or
different facts, as to which such Releasor expressly assumes the risk.

  

12.14 _Fees and Expenses_. Regardless of whether the transactions provided
for in this Agreement are consummated, except as otherwise provided herein,
each party hereto shall pay its own expenses incident to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated herein.  Buyer understands and acknowledges
that certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred or to be incurred by
the Acquired Companies up to the Closing Date in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (including Company Transaction Expenses) may
be paid by the Acquired Companies at or prior to the Closing. To the extent
that any such fees or expenses (including Company Transaction Expenses) are
not paid in full and discharged at or prior to the Closing, each Seller shall
(in accordance with the allocations set forth in _Schedule 2.6_ ) be
responsible for, and hereby agrees to pay when due, such fees and expenses
(in accordance with the allocations set forth in _Schedule 2.6_ ), and each
Seller acknowledges that the Acquired Companies shall not be obligated to pay
such fees or expenses following the Closing. Any transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance
fees, recording charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties
and interest) incurred in connection with consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid, or caused to be paid, by
Sellers when due. In any Claim to enforce the terms of this Agreement or
arising out of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover the fees and costs incurred in such Claim, including reasonable
attorneys fees.

  

12.15 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that no assignment of all
or any part of this Agreement or any right or obligation hereunder may
be made by any party hereto without the prior written consent of all other
parties hereto, and any attempted assignment without such consent shall be
void and of no force or effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) Buyer may
assign any of its rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement
(a) to any Affiliate of Buyer or to any subsequent purchaser of Buyer or
substantially all of the assets of Buyer (whether such sale is structured as
a sale of stock, a sale of assets, a merger or otherwise), provided, further,
that no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder; and
(b) Buyer may assign its rights, but not its obligations, under this
Agreement to any of its financing sources.

  

12.16 _Publicity_. Any disclosure, press releases or public announcements
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby will be
made only as may be agreed upon in writing by Seller and Buyer, or as may be
required by Law or by any Governmental Authority or other regulatory body
(including Nasdaq) or as may be required to comply with the provisions of
this Agreement, including contacting third Persons for their requisite
consents, in which case Buyer and Sellers Representative shall have the
right to review such disclosure, press releases or announcements prior to its
issuance, distribution or publication.

  

12.17 _Acquired Companies Business Unit_. Following the Closing, it is the
current intention of Buyer to merge the Subsidiaries with and into the
Company. Following such mergers, it is the Buyers current intention that (a)
each of the businesses operated by the Subsidiaries will be operated as
branches of the Company and that the management structure currently utilized
by the Acquired Companies will be maintained within the Companys

        

organization in order to encourage the continuation of the existing working
relationships of the Acquired Companies and (b) David Moorhead will be
appointed to the Beacon Executive Committee that meets regularly with the
Chief Executive Officer of Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. regarding the
management and affairs of the Buyer and its Affiliates.
