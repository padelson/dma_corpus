_EXCHANGE OF SHARES _

4.1 _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause its transfer agent (or a depository or trust
institution of recognized standing selected by BancTrust and reasonably
satisfactory to Peoples) (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to mail to the former
shareholders of Peoples appropriate transmittal materials (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates theretofore representing shares of Peoples Common Stock shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent).
After the Effective Time, each holder of shares of Peoples Common Stock
(other than shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.3 of this Agreement or
as to which dissenters rights of appraisal have been perfected as provided in
Section 3.4 of this Agreement) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time
shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares to
the Exchange Agent (or shall furnish customary documentation and indemnity if
any such certificates are lost, stolen or destroyed) and shall promptly
thereafter receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration provided in
Section 3.1 of this Agreement, together with all undelivered dividends or
distributions in respect of the shares of BancTrust Common Stock received
(without interest thereon) pursuant to Section 4.2 of this Agreement. To the
extent required by Section 3.5 of this Agreement, each holder of shares of
Peoples Common Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective Time also  



 

13  shall receive, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing such shares, cash in lieu of any fractional share of BancTrust
Common Stock to which such holder may be otherwise entitled (without
interest). The Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver the
Merger Consideration to which any former holder of Peoples Common Stock is
entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders his
certificate or certificates representing the shares of Peoples Common Stock
for exchange as provided in this Section 4.1. The certificate or certificates
of Peoples Common Stock so surrendered shall be duly endorsed as the Exchange
Agent may require. Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding,
neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to a
holder of Peoples Common Stock for any amounts paid or property delivered in
good faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property
Law.

4.2 _Rights of Former Peoples Shareholders_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Peoples shall be closed as to holders of Peoples Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and no transfer of Peoples
Common Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until
surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.1 of
this Agreement, each certificate theretofore representing shares of Peoples
Common Stock (" _Peoples Certificate_ "), other than shares to be canceled
pursuant to Sections 3.3 and 3.4 of this Agreement, shall from and after the
Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration provided in Sections 3.1 and 3.5 of this Agreement in
exchange therefor. To the extent permitted by Law, former shareholders of
record of Peoples shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any
meeting of Surviving Corporation shareholders the number of whole shares of
BancTrust Common Stock into which their respective shares of Peoples Common
Stock are converted, regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their
Peoples Certificates for certificates representing BancTrust Common Stock in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Whenever a dividend or
other distribution is declared by the Surviving Corporation on the BancTrust
Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, the
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions on all shares
issuable pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
any person holding any Peoples Certificate at or after six (6) months after
the Effective Time (the " _Cutoff_ ") shall not be entitled to receive any
dividend or other distribution payable after the Cutoff to holders of
BancTrust Common Stock, which dividend or other distribution is attributable
to such persons BancTrust Common Stock represented by said Peoples Certificate
held after the Cutoff, until such person surrenders said Peoples Certificate
for exchange as provided in Section 4.1 of this Agreement. However, upon
surrender of such Peoples Certificate, both the BancTrust Common Stock
certificate (together with all such undelivered dividends or other
distributions, without interest) and any undelivered cash payments to be paid
as consideration under Section 3.1(b) or for fractional share interests
(without interest) shall be delivered and paid with respect to each share
represented by such Peoples Certificate.

ARTICLE FIVE

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PEOPLES_

Before entry into this Agreement, Peoples delivered to BancTrust the Peoples
Disclosure Memorandum, setting forth, among other things, items the disclosure
of which is  



 

14  necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or
more representations or warranties contained in this Article Five or to one
or more of its covenants contained in Article Seven; _provided_ that the
inclusion of an item in the Peoples Disclosure Memorandum as an exception to a
representation or warranty will not by itself be deemed an admission by
Peoples that such item is Material or was required to be disclosed therein.
While Peoples has used its reasonable best efforts to identify in the Peoples
Disclosure Memorandum the particular representation or warranty or covenant
to which each such disclosure or exception relates, each such disclosure or
exception shall be deemed disclosed for purposes of all representations and
warranties in Article Five, all covenants in Article Seven and the Disclosure
Memorandum.

For all purposes of this Agreement, no representation or warranty of Peoples
contained in Article Five (other than the representations and warranties
contained in Section 5.4 which shall be true in all Material respects) will be
deemed untrue, and no party will be deemed to have breached a representation
or warranty, as a consequence of the existence of any fact, event or
circumstance unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken
together with all other facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with any
representation or warranty contained in Article Five, has had or is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Peoples or
with respect to BancTrust following the Merger.

Except as Previously Disclosed, Peoples hereby represents and warrants to
BancTrust as follows:

5.1 _Organization, Standing, and Power_. Peoples is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Alabama, and has the corporate power and authority to carry on its business
as now conducted and to own, lease and operate its Material Assets. Peoples
is duly qualified or licensed to transact business as a foreign corporation in
good standing in those other States of the United States and foreign
jurisdictions where the character of its Assets or the nature or conduct of
its business requires it to be so qualified or licensed. Peoples has delivered
or made available to BancTrust complete and correct copies of its Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws and the articles of incorporation, bylaws and other,
similar governing instruments of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as
amended through the date hereof.

5.2 _Authority; No Breach By Agreement_.

(a) Peoples has the corporate power and authority necessary to execute,
deliver and, subject to Article Nine hereof, perform its obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The

the transactions contemplated herein, including the Merger, have been duly
and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action in respect thereof on
the part of Peoples, subject to the approval of this Agreement by the holders
of Peoples Common Stock in accordance with the ABCA. Subject to such
requisite shareholder approval, this Agreement represents a legal, valid, and
binding obligation of Peoples, enforceable against Peoples in accordance with
its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar
Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally (" _Creditor s
Laws_") and except that the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court
before which any proceeding may be brought (" _Equitable Discretion_ ")).



 

15 (b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Peoples, nor the
consummation by Peoples of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by Peoples with any of the provisions hereof, will (i) conflict
with or result in a breach of any provision of Peoples Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws, or (ii) constitute or result in a Default under, or
require any Consent pursuant to, or result in the creation of any Lien on any
Asset of any Peoples Company under, any Contract or Permit of any Peoples
Company, or, (iii) subject to receipt of the requisite approvals referred to
in Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement, violate any Law or Order applicable to
any Peoples Company or any of their respective Assets.

(c) Other than in connection or compliance with the provisions of the
Securities Laws, applicable state corporate and securities Laws, and other
than Consents required from Regulatory Authorities, and other than notices to
or filings with the Internal Revenue Service or the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation with respect to any employee benefit plans, no notice to, filing
with, or Consent of, any public body or authority is necessary for the
consummation by Peoples of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
in this Agreement.

5.3 _Reports_. Since January 1, 2003, or the date of organization if later,
each Peoples Company has timely filed all reports and statements, together
with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that it was
required to file with (i) the SEC, including, but not limited to, Forms 10-K,
Forms 10-Q, Forms 8-K, and proxy statements, (ii) other Regulatory
Authorities, and (iii) any applicable state securities or banking authorities.
As of their respective dates, each of such reports and documents, including
the financial statements, exhibits, and schedules thereto, complied in all
Material respects with all applicable Laws. As of its respective date, or if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on
the date of such filing, each such report and document did not contain any
untrue statement of a Material fact or omit to state a Material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

5.4 _Capital Stock_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of Peoples consists only of 9,000,000 shares
of voting common stock, par value $.10, and 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.10, of which, as of the date of this Agreement,
5,929,561 shares of voting common stock are issued and outstanding and no
shares of preferred stock are issued and outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of Peoples are duly and validly issued

the outstanding shares of capital stock of Peoples has been issued in
violation of any preemptive rights of the current or past shareholders of
Peoples.

(b) There are no other shares of capital stock or other equity securities of
Peoples outstanding and, other than pursuant to Peoples Benefit Plans, the
Peoples dividend reinvestment plan and as Previously Disclosed, no outstanding
options, warrants, scrip, rights to subscribe to, calls, or commitments of any
character whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible into or
exchangeable for, shares of the capital stock of Peoples or contracts,
commitments, understandings, or arrangements by which Peoples is or may be
bound to issue additional shares of its capital stock or options,
warrants, or rights to purchase or acquire any additional shares of its
capital stock.



 

16 5.5 _Peoples Subsidiaries_. Peoples has Previously Disclosed all of the
Peoples Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement. Except as Previously
Disclosed, Peoples or one of its Subsidiaries owns all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of each Peoples Subsidiary. No equity
securities of any Peoples Subsidiary are or may become required to be issued
by reason of any options, warrants, scrip, rights to subscribe to, calls, or
commitments of any character whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights
convertible into or exchangeable for, shares of the capital stock of any such
Subsidiary, and there are no Contracts by which any Peoples Subsidiary is
bound to issue additional shares of its capital stock or options, warrants, or
rights to purchase or acquire any additional shares of its capital stock or by
which any Peoples Company is or may be bound to transfer any shares of the
capital stock of any Peoples Subsidiary. There are no Contracts relating to
the rights of any Peoples Company to vote or to dispose of any shares of the
capital stock of any Peoples Subsidiary. All of the shares of capital stock
of each Peoples Subsidiary held by a Peoples Company are fully paid and
nonassessable under the applicable corporation Law of the jurisdiction in
which such Subsidiary is incorporated or organized and are owned by the
Peoples Company free and clear of any Lien. Each Peoples Subsidiary is either
a bank or a corporation, and is duly organized, validly existing, and in good
standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or
organized, and has the corporate power and authority necessary for it to own,
lease and operate its Assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.
Each Peoples Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to transact business as
a foreign corporation in good standing in the States of the United States and
foreign jurisdictions where the character of its Assets or the nature or
conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified or licensed. Each
Peoples Subsidiary that is a depository institution is an "insured
institution" as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and applicable
regulations thereunder, and its deposits are fully insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation pursuant to the provisions of said act and
regulations; and the businesses of any non-bank Subsidiaries of Peoples are
permitted to subsidiaries of registered bank holding companies.

BancTrust prior to the execution of this Agreement copies of all Peoples
Financial Statements for periods ended March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006
and will deliver or make available to BancTrust copies of all Peoples

reasonably likely to have had, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Peoples and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, and (ii) the
Peoples Companies have not taken any action, or failed to take any action,
prior to the date of this Agreement, which action or failure, if taken after
the date of this Agreement, would represent or result in a Material breach or
violation of any of the covenants and agreements of Peoples provided in
Article Seven of this Agreement.

5.8 _Risk Management Instruments_. All interest rate swaps, caps, floors,
option agreements, futures and forward contracts and other similar risk
management arrangements (collectively, the " _Risk Management Instruments_

or other health plans, all life insurance plans, and all other employee
benefit plans or fringe benefit plans, including, without limitation,
"employee benefit plans" as that term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA,

contributed to by any Peoples Company or Affiliate thereof for the benefit of
employees, retirees, dependents, spouses, directors, independent contractors,
or other beneficiaries and under which employees, retirees, dependents,
spouses, directors, independent contractors, or other beneficiaries are
eligible to participate (collectively, the " _Peoples Benefit Plans_ "). Any

_"Peoples ERISA Plan_." Each Peoples ERISA Plan which is also a "defined
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 414(j) of the Internal Revenue Code) is
referred to herein as a " _Peoples Pension Plan_." Neither Peoples nor any
Peoples Company has an "obligation to contribute" (as defined in ERISA Section
4212) to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Sections 4001(a)(3) and
3(37)(A) of ERISA).

(b) Peoples has delivered or made available to BancTrust prior to the
execution of this Agreement correct and complete copies of the following
documents: (i) all trust agreements or other funding arrangements for the
Peoples Benefit Plans (including insurance contracts), and all amendments
thereto, (ii) with respect to any such Peoples Benefit Plans or amendments,

ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code, and any other applicable Laws. Each Peoples
ERISA Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code has received a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service or is within the remedial amendment period set forth
in Section 401(b) of the Internal Revenue Code for receipt thereof, and there
exist no circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable
determination letter. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Peoples has amended or will timely amend within the prescribed remedial
amendment period for same if such remedial amendment period ends prior to the
Effective Time, each Peoples ERISA Plan requiring amendment to comply with the

Reconciliation Act of 2001, the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004, the final
IRS 401(k)/(m) regulations released in December 2004 and other applicable
federal statutes and regulations requiring amendments thereto. No Peoples
Company has engaged in a transaction with  



 

23  respect to any Peoples Benefit Plan that, assuming the taxable period of
such transaction expired as of the date hereof, would subject any Peoples
Company to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Internal
Revenue Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA.

(d) No Peoples Pension Plan has any "unfunded current liability," as that
term is defined in Section 302(d)(8)(A) of ERISA, and the fair market value of
the assets of any such plan exceeds the plans "benefit liabilities," as
that term is defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA, when determined under
actuarial factors that would apply if the plan terminated in accordance with
all applicable legal requirements. Since the date of the most recent actuarial
valuation, there has been (i) no Material change in the financial position of
any Peoples Pension Plan, (ii) no change in the actuarial assumptions with
respect to any Peoples Pension Plan, and (iii) no increase in benefits under
any Peoples Pension Plan as a result of plan amendments or changes in
applicable Law. Neither any Peoples Pension Plan nor any "single-employer
plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or
formerly maintained by any Peoples Company, or the single-employer plan of
any entity which is considered one employer with Peoples under Section 4001 of
ERISA or Section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 302 of ERISA
(whether or not waived) (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ") has an "accumulated
funding deficiency" within the meaning of Section 412 of the Internal Revenue
Code or Section 302 of ERISA. No Peoples Company has provided, or is required
to provide, security to a Peoples Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan
of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

(e) Peoples does not participate currently nor has it ever participated in a
multiemployer plan under the Subtitle B of Title IV or ERISA (regardless of
whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate). No Material Liability
under Subtitle C or D of Title IV or ERISA has been or is expected to be
incurred by any Peoples Company with respect to any ongoing, frozen or
terminated single-employer plan or the single-employer plan of any ERISA
Affiliate. No Peoples Company has incurred any withdrawal Liability with
respect to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle B of Title IV or ERISA
(regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate). No
notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA
for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been
required to be filed for any Peoples Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate
within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof.

(f) Except as Previously Disclosed, (i) no Peoples Company has any obligations
for retiree health and life benefits under any of the Peoples Benefit Plans
except as required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1985 and (ii) there are no restrictions on the rights of such Peoples Company
to amend or terminate any such Plan without incurring any
Liability thereunder.

(g) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any payment
(including, without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, golden
parachute or otherwise) becoming due to any director or any employee of any
Peoples Company from any Peoples Company under any Peoples Benefit Plan or
otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Peoples
Benefit Plan, or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of any such benefit, except for accelerated vesting of certain stock
options under outstanding stock option agreements.



 

24 5.21 _Material Contracts; Defaults_.

(a) Except for those agreements and other documents filed as exhibits to
Peoples Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2006 or as Previously Disclosed, neither Peoples nor any of its Significant
Subsidiaries is a party to, bound by or subject to any agreement, contract,
arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether written or oral) (A) that
is a "material contract" within the meaning of Item 601(b)(10) of the SECs
Regulation S-K, or (B) that restricts the conduct of business by it or any of
its Subsidiaries or its or their ability to compete in any line of business,
or (C) that (i) requires payments by Peoples in excess of $100,000 in any
consecutive twelve month period, and (ii) either may not be terminated within
one year from the date hereof, or automatically renews for a term in excess

policy or other instrument to which it is a party, by which its respective
assets, business, or operations may be bound or affected, or under which it
or its respective assets, business, or operations receives benefits, and there
has not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of
notice or both, would constitute such a default.

5.22 _Legal Proceedings_. Except as Previously Disclosed, there is no
Litigation instituted or pending, or, to the Knowledge of Peoples, threatened
(or unasserted but considered probable of assertion and which if asserted
would have at least a reasonable probability of an unfavorable outcome)
against any Peoples Company, or against any Asset, interest, or right of any
of them, nor are there any Orders of any Regulatory Authorities, other
governmental authorities, or arbitrators outstanding against any Peoples
Company.

5.23 _Tax and Regulatory Matters_. Peoples has not, and to Peoples Knowledge,
no Peoples Company or any Affiliate thereof has taken any action, and Peoples
has no Knowledge of any fact or circumstance, that is reasonably likely to
(i) prevent the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, or (ii) Materially impede or delay receipt of any Consents of
Regulatory Authorities referred to in Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement or
result in the imposition of a condition or restriction of the type referred to
in the last sentence of such Section.

5.24 _Charter Provisions_. Each Peoples Company has taken all action so that
the entering into of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement do not and will not
result in the grant of any rights to any Person under the Articles or

Peoples Company or restrict or impair the ability of the Surviving
Corporation to vote, or otherwise to exercise the rights of a shareholder with
respect to, shares of any Peoples Company that may be acquired or controlled

Before entry into this Agreement, BancTrust delivered to Peoples the
BancTrust Disclosure Memorandum, setting forth, among other things, items the
disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an
express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as
an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in this
Article Six or to one or more of its covenants contained in Article Seven;
_provided_ that the inclusion of an item in the BancTrust Disclosure
Memorandum as an exception to a representation or warranty will not by itself
be deemed an admission by BancTrust that such item is Material or was required
to be disclosed therein. While BancTrust has used its reasonable best efforts
to identify in the BancTrust Disclosure Memorandum the particular
representation or warranty or covenant to which each such disclosure or
exception relates, each such disclosure or exception shall be deemed disclosed

all covenants in Article Seven and the Disclosure Memorandum.

For all purposes of this Agreement, no representation or warranty of
BancTrust contained in Article Six (other than the representations and
warranties contained in Section 6.4, which shall be true in all Material
respects) will be deemed untrue, and no party will be deemed to have breached
a representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence of any fact,
event or circumstance unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or

other Liabilities due with respect to completed and settled examinations or

Internal Revenue Code.

(f) To the Knowledge of BancTrust, none of the BancTrust Companies has made
any payments, is obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any
contract, agreement or other arrangement that could obligate it to make any
payments that would be disallowed as a deduction under Section 280G or 162(m)
of the Internal Revenue Code.

Material transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability
for assets, (c) access to BancTrusts Material assets is permitted only in
accordance with managements general or specific authorization, and (d) the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals, and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences. To the extent required, the BancTrust Companies have devised and
maintained a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the 1934 Act sufficient to insure that information
required to be disclosed by BancTrust in the reports that it files or submits
under the 1934 Act is accumulated and communicated to BancTrusts management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

6.13 _Assets_. Except as Previously Disclosed or as disclosed or reserved
against in the BancTrust Financial Statements and to BancTrusts knowledge,
the BancTrust Companies have good and indefeasible title, free and clear of

consistent with BancTrusts past practices. All Assets which are Material to
BancTrusts business on a consolidated basis, held under leases or subleases
by any of the BancTrust Companies, are held under valid Contracts enforceable
in accordance with their respective terms (except as enforceability may be
limited by Creditors Laws  



 

31  and Equitable Discretion), and each such Contract is in full force and
effect. The policies of fire, theft, liability, and other insurance maintained
with respect to the Assets or businesses of the BancTrust Companies provide
adequate coverage under current industry practices against loss or Liability,

BancTrust Companies include all assets required to operate the business of the
BancTrust Companies as presently conducted.

Hazardous Material in, on, under or affecting such properties, except for
releases in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. It
is acknowledged by the Parties that BancTrust has made no additional inquiry
in regard to the matters reflected in this Section 6.15 as to its Loan
Properties for the purpose of making the representations and warranties
contained herein.

manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit or reserve policies, its
management, or the payment of dividends.

6.16 _Legal Proceedings_. Except as disclosed in BancTrusts filings with the
SEC, there is no litigation instituted or pending, or to BancTrusts

unfavorable outcome) against any BancTrust Company, or against any Material
Asset, interest, or right of any BancTrust Company, nor are there any orders
of any Regulatory Authorities, other governmental agencies, or arbitrators
outstanding against any BancTrust Company.

6.17 _Tax and Regulatory Matters_. BancTrust has not taken any action, and
BancTrust has no Knowledge of any fact or circumstance, that is reasonably
likely to (i) prevent the transactions contemplated hereby, including the

light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None
of the information supplied or to be supplied by any BancTrust Company for

taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper, or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective,
as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, using its
reasonable efforts to lift or rescind any Order adversely affecting
its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated herein and to cause
to be satisfied the conditions referred to in Article Nine of this Agreement.
Each Party shall use, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use, its
reasonable best efforts to obtain all Consents necessary or desirable for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

8.6  _Investigation and Confidentiality_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Parties will keep one another advised of
all Material developments relevant to their respective businesses and to
consummation of the Merger, and each Party shall permit the other to make or
cause to be made such investigation of their respective businesses and
properties and the businesses and properties of their respective Subsidiaries
and of their respective financial and legal conditions as may be reasonably
requested, provided that such investigation shall be reasonably related to the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not interfere unnecessarily with
normal operations. No such investigation shall affect the representations and
warranties of either Party.

(b) Each Party shall, and shall cause its advisers and agents to, maintain the
confidentiality of all confidential information furnished to it by the other
Party concerning its and its Subsidiaries businesses, operations,
and financial positions and shall not use such information for any purpose
except in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If
this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall
promptly return all documents and copies thereof, and all work papers
containing confidential information received from the other Party.

(c) Each Party agrees to give the other Party notice as soon as practicable
after any determination by it of any fact or occurrence relating to the other
Party which it has discovered through the course of its investigation or
otherwise and which represents, or is reasonably likely to represent, either
a Material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
the other Party or which has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the other Party.

8.7 _Press Releases_. Prior to the Effective Time, Peoples and BancTrust shall
consult with each other as to the form and substance of any press release or
other public disclosure Materially related to this Agreement or any other
transaction contemplated hereby; provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 8.7 shall be deemed to prohibit any Party from making any
disclosure which its counsel deems necessary or advisable in order to satisfy
such Partys disclosure obligations imposed by Law, and provided, further,
that prior to making such disclosure such Party making the disclosure shall
provide to the other Party the text of such disclosure sufficiently in
advance to enable the other Party to have a reasonable opportunity to comment
thereon.



 

39 8.8 _Certain Actions_.

(a) Peoples will not, and will cause the Peoples Subsidiaries and its and the
Peoples Subsidiaries officers, directors, agents, advisors and affiliates
not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or
proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or
provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have any
discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; provided
that, in the event Peoples receives an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition
Proposal, including from an Other Person (as defined below), after the
execution of this Agreement, and the Peoples board of directors concludes in
good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal,
Peoples may, and may permit the Peoples Subsidiaries and the Peoples
Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic
information and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent
that the Peoples board of directors concludes in good faith (and based on the
advice of counsel) that failure to take such actions would more likely than
not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law;
provided, further, that prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted
to be provided pursuant to the foregoing provision, Peoples shall have entered
into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms Materially no
less favorable to Peoples than the confidentiality agreement, dated January
17, 2007, between BancTrust and Peoples (without regard to any modification
thereof pursuant hereto). Peoples will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the
date of this Agreement with any persons other than BancTrust (each, an "
_Other Person_ ") with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its
reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement
relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Peoples will promptly (within two
business days) advise BancTrust following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal
and the substance thereof (including the identity of the person making such
Acquisition Proposal), and will keep BancTrust apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms and conditions
of the Acquisition Proposal) on a current basis.

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Peoples or the Peoples
board of directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, provided that such Rules
will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such
Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

(c) BancTrust shall promptly notify Peoples orally and in writing in the event
that it receives an offer or a serious proposal relating to, or engages in
negotiations with respect to, an Acquisition Transaction; provided that, if
requested by BancTrust, Peoples shall, except to the extent required by Law,
keep the information furnished pursuant to this Section 8.8(c) confidential
until such Acquisition Transaction is made public by BancTrust or another
party thereto.

8.9 _Tax Treatment_. Each of the Parties undertakes and agrees to use its
reasonable efforts to cause the Merger, and to take no action which would
cause the Merger not, to qualify for treatment as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income
tax purposes.



 

40 8.10 _State Takeover Laws_. Each Peoples Company shall take all necessary
steps to exempt the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from, or if
necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any purportedly
applicable Takeover Laws.

8.11 _Charter Provisions_.

(a) Each Peoples Company shall take all necessary action to ensure that the
entering into of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the grant
of any rights to any Person under the Certificate or Articles of
Incorporation, Bylaws or other governing instruments of any Peoples Company
or restrict or impair the ability of BancTrust to vote, or otherwise to
exercise the rights of a shareholder with respect to, shares of any Peoples
Company that may be acquired or controlled by it.

(b) Each BancTrust Company shall take all necessary action to ensure that the
entering into of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the grant
of any rights to any Person under the Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or
other governing instruments of any BancTrust Company or restrict or
impair the ability of any Peoples shareholder to vote, or otherwise exercise
the rights of a shareholder with respect to, shares of BancTrust Common Stock
that may be acquired or controlled by it.

8.12 _Affiliates_. Not later than 15 days before the mailing of the Proxy
Statement, Peoples will identify to BancTrust each Person who it reasonably
believes may be deemed an "affiliate" for purposes of Rule 145 under the 1933
Act. Shares of BancTrust Common Stock issued to such affiliates of Peoples in
exchange for shares of Peoples Common Stock (and shares of BancTrust Common
Stock held by persons who are "affiliates" of BancTrust) shall not be
transferable regardless of whether each such affiliate has provided the
written agreement referred to in this Section 8.12 (and BancTrust shall be
entitled to place restrictive legends upon certificates for shares of
BancTrust Common Stock issued to affiliates of Peoples pursuant to this
Agreement to enforce the provisions of this Section 8.12) except as provided
herein. BancTrust shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement under the 1933 Act for the purposes of resale of
BancTrust Common Stock by such affiliates. Peoples shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause each director and executive officer of Peoples to
deliver to BancTrust not later than thirty (30) days prior to the Effective
Time, a written agreement, substantially in the form of _Exhibit 2_ ,
providing that such Person will not sell, pledge, transfer, or
otherwise dispose of the shares of Peoples Common Stock held by such Person
except as contemplated by such agreement or by this Agreement and will not
sell, pledge, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the shares of BancTrust Common
Stock to be received by such Person upon consummation of the Merger except in
compliance with applicable provisions of the 1933 Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

8.13 _Compensation and Employee Benefits_.

(a) _General_. Following the Effective Time, BancTrust shall
provide generally to officers and employees of the Peoples Companies, who at
or after the Effective Time become employees of a BancTrust Company ("
_Continuing Employees_ "), employee benefits under the employee benefit plans
and programs maintained for employees of the BancTrust Companies  



 

41  (" _BancTrust Benefit Plans_ ") (other than stock option or other plans
involving the potential issuance of BancTrust Common Stock, which shall be
solely at BancTrusts discretion, and any defined benefit pension plans which
have been closed to new participants), on terms and conditions which when
taken as a whole are substantially similar to those currently provided by the
BancTrust Companies to their similarly situated officers and employees. For
purposes of participation and vesting (but not accrual of benefits) under such
BancTrust Benefit Plans, each Continuing Employee will be entitled to credit
for prior service with any Peoples Company. BancTrust shall cause the
BancTrust welfare benefit plans to cover the Continuing Employees after the
Effective Time to (i) waive any waiting period and restrictions and
limitations for pre-existing conditions or insurability, and (ii) cause any
deductible, co-insurance, or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by the
Continuing Employees under Peoples welfare benefit plans to be credited to
such Continuing Employees under BancTrusts welfare benefit plans, so as to
reduce the amount of any deductible, co-insurance, or maximum out-of-pocket
payments payable by the Continuing Employees under BancTrust welfare benefit
plans. The continued coverage of the Continuing Employees under the employee
benefit plans maintained by Peoples and/or any Peoples Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Effective Time during a transition period shall be deemed to
provide the Continuing Employees with benefits that are no less favorable than
those offered to other employees of BancTrust and its Subsidiaries, provided
that after the Effective Time there is no Material reduction (determined on an
overall basis) in the benefits provided under the Peoples Employee Benefit
Plans. BancTrust shall honor and also shall cause Peoples and its
Subsidiaries to honor all employment, severance, consulting and other
compensation Contracts Previously Disclosed by Peoples between any Peoples
Company and any current or former director, officer or employee thereof,
and all provisions for vested benefits or other vested amounts earned or
accrued through the Effective Time under the Peoples Benefit Plans.

(b) _Retirement Plans_. Subject to Section 8.13(a), between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, BancTrust intends to determine what actions
to take with respect to the possible amendment or termination of the Peoples
defined benefit pension plan, the Peoples 401(k) plan and the Peoples Employee
Stock Ownership Plan and whether and how to combine the Peoples Benefit Plans
and the BancTrust Benefit Plans into a unified combination of BancTrust
Company employee benefits, provided that in no event shall any such
determinations, actions or decisions be undertaken or effected that would have
the effect of reducing the accrued benefits of the participants under the
Peoples Benefit Plans. In connection therewith, Peoples shall take all
actions reasonably requested by BancTrust (any of which actions may be taken
subject to the effectiveness of the Merger) and not inconsistent with Peoples
obligations under ERISA, to terminate or amend such plans and any other
Peoples Benefit Plans BancTrust elects to terminate or amend.

8.14 _Indemnification_.

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, BancTrust
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former directors
and officers of The Peoples Bank and Trust Company (the " _Bank_ ") and
Peoples (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, settlements or liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") as incurred,
in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (each a " _Claim_
"), arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or before the Effective
Time (including



 

42 the transactions contemplated hereby), (1) to the same extent as such persons
are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses pursuant to the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Peoples or the Bank and
indemnification agreements, if any, in effect on the date of this Agreement
with Peoples or the Bank, and (2) without limitation of clause (1), to the
fullest extent permitted by Law.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
8.14 shall promptly notify BancTrust upon learning of any Claim, provided
that failure so to notify shall not affect the obligation of BancTrust under
this Section 8.14, unless, and only to the extent that, BancTrust is actually
and materially prejudiced as a consequence.

(c) Peoples may, subject to BancTrusts prior written consent which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, purchase prior to or after Closing
extended coverage providing certain liability insurance coverages to officers
and directors of Peoples for acts and events occurring prior to the Effective
Time on substantially the same terms as now exist, with such extended
coverage to be prepaid and non-cancelable, to continue in effect for a
reasonable period, not to exceed three years, after the Effective Time. To the
extent the extended coverage is not finally in place and in effect by
the Effective Time, Peoples may establish an escrow fund in the amount of the
estimated premiums, such fund to be used for the purpose of purchasing such
extended coverage. In the event such extended coverage is not available at
Closing or not approved by BancTrust, then for a period of six years
following the Effective Time, BancTrust will use its reasonable best efforts
to provide directors and officers liability insurance that serves to
reimburse the present and former officers and directors of Peoples or its
Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims
against such directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring
before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated hereby),
which insurance will contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and
contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Party, as
that coverage currently provided by Peoples; _provided_ that if BancTrust is
unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 8.14,
BancTrust will use all reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable
insurance as is reasonably available; and _provided, further,_ that officers
and directors of Peoples or its Subsidiaries may be required to make
application and provide customary representations and warranties to
BancTrusts insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such insurance

(d) If BancTrust or any of its successors and assigns (i) shall consolidate
with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its property and
assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
BancTrust and its Subsidiaries shall assume the obligations set forth in this
section.

(e) The provisions of this Section 8.14 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Party, and each Indemnified
Partys heirs and personal and legal representatives.

8.15 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Before the Effective
Time, the BancTrust Board of Directors, or a committee of "non-employee
directors" thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d)
under the Exchange Act), will reasonably promptly and in  



 

43  any event before the Effective Time adopt a resolution providing that the
receipt by the Peoples officers and directors subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act of BancTrust Common Stock
in exchange for shares of Peoples Common Stock, pursuant to the transactions
contemplated hereby are approved by the BancTrust Board of Directors or by
such committee thereof, and are intended to be exempt from the liability
pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act, such that any such receipt
will be so exempt.

8.16 _Dividend Reinvestment Plan_. As soon as is practicable after the date of
this Agreement, Peoples shall terminate The Peoples BancTrust Company, Inc.
Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan.

8.17 _Subsidiary Directors_. At the Closing Peoples shall deliver to BancTrust
the resignations of each of the directors of the Peoples Subsidiaries for
whom they are requested by BancTrust.

8.18 _Certain Support Agreements_. For so long as this Agreement is in effect
and without the prior written consent of Peoples, BancTrust shall not amend,
modify or terminate the support agreements it obtained from shareholders of
Peoples who delivered support agreements and shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to enforce BancTrusts rights thereunder and to cause the
shares represented thereunder to be voted in favor of the Merger.

obtained from any Regulatory Authority which is necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be conditioned or restricted in a
manner (including, without limitation, requirements relating to the raising of
additional capital or the disposition of assets) which in the reasonable
judgment of the Board of Directors of either Party would so Materially
adversely impact the economic or business benefits of the transactions

Consents required for consummation of the Merger (other than those referred
to in Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement) or for the preventing of any Default

reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on such Party. No Consent so obtained which is necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby shall be conditioned or
restricted in a manner which in the reasonable judgment of the Board of
Directors of either Party would so Materially adversely impact the economic or
business benefits of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to
render inadvisable the consummation of the Merger.

(d) _Legal Proceedings_. No court or governmental or regulatory authority of

defined in Section 368(a) of the Code; (ii) no gain or loss will be recognized
by BancTrust or Peoples by reason of the Merger, (iii) the exchange or
cancellation of shares of Peoples Common Stock in the Merger will not give

respect to cash in lieu of fractional shares); (iv) the basis of the BancTrust

and (v) if Peoples Common Stock is a capital asset in the hands of the
shareholder at the Effective Time, the holding period of the BancTrust Common

(a) By mutual consent of the Board of Directors of BancTrust and the Board of
Directors of Peoples; or

other Party of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement which cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) days after

breach by the other Party of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement which cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) days after
the giving of written notice to the breaching Party of such breach; or

 

(d) By the Board of Directors of either Party (provided that the terminating
Party is not then in Material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, or other agreement contained in this Agreement) in the
event (i) any Consent of any Regulatory Authority required for consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall have been
denied by final nonappealable action of such authority or if any action taken

(f) By the Board of Directors of either Party in the event that the Merger
shall not have been consummated by March 31, 2008, if the failure to

(g) By the Board of Directors of either Party in the event that any of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of such Party to consummate

48 10.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination and abandonment
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1 of this Agreement, this Agreement
shall become void and have no effect, except that (i) the provisions of this

this Agreement shall survive any such termination and abandonment.

10.3 _Termination of Representations and Covenants_. The representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement will not survive the Effective Time.
All covenants, agreements and undertakings required by this Agreement to be

such termination pursuant to Section 10.1(h), a definitive agreement with

in the case of an Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer, the Board of
Directors of Peoples recommends that the Peoples shareholders tender their
shares of Peoples Common Stock to the offeror, or (iii) in the case of an
Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer, the Peoples shareholders tender a
majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Peoples Common Stock to the

agree that the Termination Fee is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. If
a court of competent jurisdiction shall nonetheless, by a final,
