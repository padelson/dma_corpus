Parent, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled
and retired without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall

                   -------------------------------
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common
                                                            -----------------
Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
-----
remain issued and outstanding after the Merger as a share of the Surviving

Merger Sub will be issued or used in the Merger.

                  (d) Conversion of Company Common Stock held by Light Company.
                      --------------------------------------------------------

the Company and the Parent shall mutually designate a bank or trust company to
act as agent (the "Paying Agent") for the holders of shares of Company Common
                   ------------
Stock in connection with the Merger to receive the funds to which holders of

as directed by the Parent.

<PAGE>


               (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the
                   -------------------
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") which as of the Effective Time
                                  ------------
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Cancelled Shares")
                                                             ----------------
that were cancelled or converted and became instead the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1: (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and
such other provisions upon which the Parent and the Company may agree) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to the
Paying Agent for cancellation (or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by mutual agreement of the Parent and the Company), together with a
duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as the Paying Agent
may require, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as
provided in Section 2.4) in exchange for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly evidenced by such Certificate, which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Cancelled Shares which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be given to a
transferee if the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
representing such Cancelled Shares is presented to the Paying Agent accompanied
by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence
satisfactory to the Paying Agent that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2. No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration payable to
holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

               (c) Closing of Transfer Books; Rights of Holders of Company
                   -------------------------------------------------------
Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
------------

Company shall be closed and no registration of any transfer of any capital stock
of the Company shall thereafter be made on the records of the Company. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, as provided
in this Section 2.2. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock,
except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable law.

               (d) Termination of Paying Agent. At any time commencing six
                   ---------------------------
months after the Effective Time, the Parent shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the
Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock
(including, without limitation, all interest and other income received by the
Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) only as general creditors
thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of a share of Company Common Stock for any Merger
Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant
to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

               (e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
                   --------------------------------------
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder of shares of Company Common Stock claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Parent,
the posting by such holder of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as
may be required by the Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay the Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any

Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) that are
reasonably designed (but without making any representation or warranty as to the
effectiveness of any such controls or procedures so designed) to ensure that
material information (both financial and non-financial) relating to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries required to be disclosed by the Company in the

summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms

persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions

Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) there have not been any
significant developments since December 31, 2005 with respect to claims, suits,

expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (c) there are no judgments, decrees, injunctions, rules or
orders of any court, governmental department, commission, agency,
instrumentality or authority or any arbitrator applicable to the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries except for such that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not resulted in since December 31, 2005 or would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except for matters
reflected as liabilities or reserved against in the balance sheet (or notes
thereto) as of December 31, 2005, included in the Company Financial Statements,
as of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary

or otherwise, or whether due or to become due) of any nature and whether or not
required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company
and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including the notes thereto), except
liabilities or obligations (i) that were incurred since December 31, 2005 in the
ordinary course of business consistent in kind and amount with past practice, or
(ii) that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set
forth in Section 4.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and except as may be
set forth in any Company Required Statutory Approval or Parent Required
Statutory Approval, there are no restrictions (contractual or regulatory)
limiting the ability of the Light Company from making distributions, dividends
or other return of capital to the Company. Neither the Company nor Light Company
has granted a general lien to secure indebtedness over its general intangibles,
accounts receivable and/or deposit accounts; it being understood that this
representation is not intended to address statutory or contractual rights of set
off.

                                      ---------------------
of accrued benefits under such plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions used

accrued benefits.

               (e) Funding. No Title IV Company Plan has incurred any
                   -------
"accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section

administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
applicable law, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code. As of the date
hereof, there is no material pending or, to the knowledge of the Company
threatened, litigation relating to the Company Plans. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Company
Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the
date hereof, could subject the Company or any Company Subsidiary to a tax or
penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in
an amount which would be material. Neither the Company nor any of its

be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service covering all tax law
changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001
and the Company is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in the loss
of the qualification of such Company Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code.

               (i) Post-Employment Benefits. Except as set forth in Section
                   ------------------------

other termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable
law, (ii) death benefits under any "pension plan," or (iii) benefits the full
cost of which is borne by the current or former employee (or his beneficiary).
Except as limited by applicable terms of collective bargaining agreements to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or is otherwise bound,

time without incurring any liability thereunder other than in respect of claims
incurred prior to such amendment or termination.

Agreement, stockholder approval of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (w) result in payments under any of the
Benefit Plans that would not be deductible under Section 162(m) or Section 280G
of the Code, (x) entitle any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of
employment after the date hereof, (y) accelerate the time of payment or vesting
or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or result in any
other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Company Plans, or (z) except
as limited by applicable terms of collective bargaining agreements to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or is otherwise bound, limit or
restrict the right of the Company or, after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Parent, to merge, amend or terminate any of the Company
Plans. There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under,
any Company Plan which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such

          Section 7.1  Access to Company Information.  Upon reasonable
                       -----------------------------
notice, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, afford
to the officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, investment bankers,

of the Parent reasonable access, upon reasonable advance notice, during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of its

shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the Parent and its
Representative, (i) access to each report, schedule and other document filed or
received by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities laws or filed with or sent to the
SEC, FERC, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission or any other
federal or state regulatory agency or commission and (ii) access to all
information concerning the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, and their
respective directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may
be reasonably requested by the Parent or its Representatives in connection with
any filings, applications or approvals required or contemplated by this
Agreement or for any other reason related to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company or any
                --------  -------
Company Subsidiary be obligated to provide any access or information if the
Company or the Company Subsidiary reasonably determines, in good faith after
consultation with counsel, that providing such access or information is likely
to violate applicable law, cause either the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
breach a confidentiality obligation to which it is bound or jeopardize any
recognized privilege available to either the Company or any Company Subsidiary.
The Parent agrees to indemnify and hold the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
harmless from any and all claims and liabilities, including costs and expenses
for loss, injury to or death of any Representative of the Parent, and any damage
to or destruction of any property owned by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or others (including claims or liabilities for loss of use of any
property) resulting from the action of any of the Representatives of the
Parent (other than as directed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any
of their respective Representatives) during any visit to the business or
property sites of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing
Date, whether pursuant to this Section 7.1 or otherwise.  During any visit to
the business or property sites of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, the Parent shall, and shall cause its Representatives accessing
such properties to, comply with all applicable laws and all of the Company's and
the Company Subsidiaries' safety and security procedures and conduct itself in
a manner that would not be reasonably expected to interfere with the operation,
maintenance or repair of the assets of the Company or such Company Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parent shall not have the

thereof or supplement thereto, to be sent to the shareholders of the Company in
connection with the Merger (the "Proxy Statement") will comply in all material

Statement. The Company and the Parent each agrees to respond as promptly as is
practicable to any comments of the SEC on the Proxy Statement and to mail the
Proxy Statement to holders of Company Common Stock promptly after the Company
learns that the Proxy Statement will not be reviewed or that the SEC staff has
no further comments thereon. The information provided by any party hereto for
use in or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement shall be true and
correct in all material respects, at the dates mailed to Shareholders of the
Company and at the time of the Company Meeting (as defined below), without
omission of any material fact which is required to make such information not
false or misleading. No representation, covenant or agreement is made by any
party hereto with respect to information supplied by any other party for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to the Company, the Parent or the Merger Sub, or any of
their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the
Company, the Parent or the Merger Sub which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and,
to the extent required by law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or claims damages in connection
therewith, the Company and the Parent each agree to cooperate and use their
reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond thereto.

                                       44
<PAGE>

law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time,
an officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each an
"Indemnified Party" and collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against (i) all
 -----------------                         -------------------
losses, expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses), claims,
damages or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the next succeeding
sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising out of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time) to the extent that they are based on
or arising out of the fact that such Person is or was a director, officer or
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the "Indemnified
                                                        -----------
Liabilities"), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they are based
-----------
on or arise out of or pertain to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In the event of any such loss, expense, claim, damage or liability
(whether or not arising before the Effective Time), (i) the Surviving
Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by
the Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation, promptly after statements therefor are received and
otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request, reimbursement of
documented expenses reasonably incurred, in either case to the extent not
prohibited by the business corporation law of the Surviving Corporation's state
of incorporation, (ii) the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties
will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) any determination
required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Party's conduct
complies with the standards set forth under the business corporation law of the
Surviving Corporation's state of incorporation and the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be made by
independent counsel mutually acceptable to the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not
                   --------  -------
be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld). The Indemnified Parties as a group may
retain only one law firm with respect to each related matter except to the
extent there is, in the opinion of counsel to an Indemnified Party, under

issue between positions of such Indemnified Party and any other Indemnified
Party or Indemnified Parties.

               (b) Insurance. The Parent shall cause the Surviving
                   ---------
Corporation to purchase a six-year extended reporting period endorsement
("reporting tail coverage") under the Company's existing directors' and

                                             ---------------------
that such reporting tail coverage shall extend the director and officer
liability coverage in force as of the date hereof from the Effective Time on
terms, that in all material respects, are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries thereof than the existing directors' and officers' liability
insurance; provided, that the cost for such policy does not exceed 300% of the
           --------


                                       45
<PAGE>

2006 premium for the Existing D&O Coverage (the "Maximum Amount"), and if it
                                                 --------------
does the Surviving Corporation shall purchase the greatest coverage available
for the Maximum Amount.

               (c) Successors. In the event the Surviving Corporation, the
                   ----------
Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in either
such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors, assigns
and/or transferees of the Surviving Corporation or the Parent shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.5.

               (d) Survival of Indemnification. To the fullest extent permitted
                   ---------------------------
by law, from and after the Effective Time, all rights to indemnification as of
the date hereof in favor of the employees, agents, directors and officers of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries with respect to their activities as such prior
to, on or after the Effective Time, as provided in their respective articles of
incorporation and by-laws in effect on the date thereof, or otherwise in effect
on the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time,
provided that, in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such
survival period, all such rights to indemnification in respect to any claim or
claims shall continue until final disposition of such claim or claims.

               (e) Benefit. The provisions of this Section 7.5 are intended to
                   -------
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his
or her heirs, executors or administrators and his or her representatives.

          Section 7.6 Public Announcements. Except as may be required by law or
                      --------------------

securities exchange, the Company and the Parent shall consult with each other
prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public announcements
with respect to (i) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) material corporate and financial information relating to the
Company. Each of the Company and Parent will, to the extent practicable, provide
the other, reasonably in advance of its use, with drafts of any press release or
other widely disseminated presentation or other information, in each case
relating to the Merger or material corporate and financial information relating
to the Company, and give reasonable consideration to the comments of the other
thereon. In connection with the foregoing, the Company and the Parent may share
any such drafts with their respective investors and representatives provided
that any such investors or representatives are bound by an obligation to
maintain the confidentiality of such information sufficient to satisfy the
requirements of Regulation FD promulgated under the Securities Act. Each of the
Company and Parent will advise the other in advance of the timing of any such
press release, presentation or other information relating to the Merger and will
provide the other with a final copy of the same simultaneously with its public
release.

shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor all
contracts and agreements of the parties in effect as of the date hereof that
apply to any current or former employee or current or former director or
consultant of the parties hereto; provided, however, that, except to the extent
                                  --------  -------
otherwise provided in Section 7.8, this undertaking is not intended to prevent
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from enforcing such
contracts, agreements and collective bargaining agreements in accordance with
their terms, including, without limitation, any reserved right to amend, modify,
suspend, revoke or terminate any such contract, agreement, collective bargaining
agreement or commitment, or portion thereof.

               (b) Workforce Matters. The Parent shall cause any workforce
                   -----------------
reductions carried out following the Effective Time by the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to be in accordance with all applicable collective
bargaining agreements and all laws and regulations governing the employment
relationship and termination thereof including, without limitation, the WARN Act

law.

          Section 7.8 Employee Benefit Plans.
                      ----------------------

               (a) Continued Employment; Service Credit. The Parent shall cause
                   ------------------------------------
the Surviving Corporation, as of the Closing Date, to continue the employment of
all employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who were employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Affected Employees"). The Parent
                                            ------------------
shall cause all service under any Company Plan that was recognized, accrued or
credited under such Company Plan immediately preceding the Effective Time to
continue to be recognized, accrued or credited for all relevant purposes under
such Company Plan as of and at all times following the Effective Time. Subject
to obligations under applicable law and applicable collective bargaining
agreements, the Parent shall cause all Affected Employees to be credited with
all service for the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (and all other service
credited by the Company or the Company Subsidiary) under (x) all employee
benefit plans, programs and policies (if any) of the Parent or its direct or
indirect Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) in which the
Affected Employees first become participants on or after the Effective Time, for
purposes of eligibility and vesting but not for benefit accrual purposes or
eligibility for early retirement purposes under defined benefit pension plans
and not to the extent crediting such service would result in duplication of
benefits and (y) any severance or vacation plans of the Parent or its direct or
indirect Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) for purposes of


                                       47
<PAGE>

determining the amount of each Affected Employee's severance and vacation
benefits. The Parent shall, and shall cause its direct or indirect Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation), or shall use its reasonable efforts to
cause its insurance carrier, to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to each Affected Employee under any welfare
benefit plan in which the Affected Employee participates on or after the Closing
Date, except to the extent of limitations or waiting periods that are already in
effect with respect to the Affected Employee as of the Closing Date and that
have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date and (ii) credit each Affected
Employee for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements for the year
in which the Closing Date occurs under any welfare plan in which the Affected
Employee participates on and after the Closing Date. Nothing in this Section
7.8(a) shall be deemed to create any right of employment with respect to any
Affected Employee.

               (b) Continuation of Benefits. Subject to applicable law and
                   ------------------------
obligations under applicable collective bargaining agreements, the Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain for a period of at least one year
after the Closing Date, without interruption, such employee compensation and
benefit plans, programs and policies (other than stock or equity based plans and
policies so long as any such plans and policies are replaced with plans or
policies of equivalent value) as will provide compensation and benefits to each
Affected Employee that in the aggregate are no less favorable than those
provided pursuant to such employee compensation and benefit plans, programs and
policies of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as in effect on the Closing
Date; provided, however, that the Parent shall, for one year following the
      -------   -------

Company Shareholders' Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith, based on the advice of outside counsel, that it is necessary to

the conduct of directors, the Company may, in response to an Acquisition
Proposal which was not solicited by it or which did not otherwise result from a
breach of this Section 7.9(a), and subject to the Company's compliance with
Section 7.9(c), (A) furnish information with respect to it and the Company
Subsidiaries to any Person pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (as
determined after consultation with its outside counsel), the benefits of the
terms of which, if more favorable to the other party to such confidentiality
agreement than those in place with the Parent, shall be extended to the Parent,
and (B) participate in negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

               (b) Procedures. Except as expressly permitted by this Section
                   ----------
7.9(b), neither the Board of Directors of the Company, nor any committee thereof

                                ---------------------
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that there
exists a Superior Proposal (as defined below), the Board of Directors of the
Company may, prior to securing the Company Shareholders' Approval, subject to
this and the following sentences of this Section 7.9(b), withdraw or modify its
approval or recommendation of the Merger or the approval of the matters to be
considered at the Company Meeting, and/or the Board of Directors of the Company
may, prior to securing the Company Shareholders' Approval (subject to this and
the following sentences of this Section 7.9(b)), approve or recommend such
Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement (and, subject to Article IX
hereof, concurrently with such termination, if it so chooses, cause the Company
to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal),
but only if (i) the Company is not in material breach of any of the terms of
this Agreement, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company authorizes the
Company to enter into a binding written Acquisition Agreement concerning an
Acquisition Transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company
notifies the Parent in writing that it intends to enter into such an Acquisition
Agreement, attaching such Acquisition Agreement to such notice and specifying
any material terms and conditions not included in the Acquisition Agreement and
further identifying the party making the Superior Proposal, and (iii) the Parent
does not make, within five (5) business days of receipt of written notification
from the Company of the Company's intention to enter into a binding Acquisition
Agreement for a Superior Proposal, an offer that the Board of Directors of the
Company believes, in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors,
is at least as favorable, from a financial point of view, to its shareholders as


                                       50
<PAGE>

binding Acquisition Agreement referred to in clause (ii) above until at least
the sixth business day after it has provided the notice to the Parent required
hereby and (ii) to notify the Parent promptly, if its intention to enter into
the written Acquisition Agreement referred to in its notification shall change
at any time after giving such notification. For purposes of this Agreement, a
"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written proposal made by a third party
 -----------------
to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash and/or
securities, more than fifty percent (50%) of the equity securities of the
Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors or all or
substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and otherwise on
terms which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith
judgment (x) (based on the written opinion of a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation (which opinion shall be provided to the Parent)) to be
more favorable from a financial point of view to the Company's shareholders
after consideration of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, (y)
to be more favorable to the Company than the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby after taking into account any additional constituencies
(including shareholders) and other pertinent factors permitted under the laws of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and (z) to constitute a transaction that is
reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms proposed by the party making
the proposal, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal.

orally and in writing of such Acquisition Proposal, any request for information,

the identity of the Person making such request or Acquisition Proposal. If the
Company has received an Acquisition Proposal, it shall keep the Parent
reasonably informed of the status and details (including amendments or proposed
amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal.

               (b) Corporate Contributions. After the Effective Time and for a
                   -----------------------

community support provided by the Company in such region as set forth in the
Company's budget for 2006.

          Section 7.11 Expenses. Subject to Section 9.3, all costs and expenses
                       --------
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses; provided, however,
                                                           --------  -------
that the expenses incurred for experts, other than legal counsel, retained for
the purpose of advising and supporting joint regulatory filings shall be shared
equally by the Company and Parent.

          Section 7.12 Further Assurances. Each party will, and will cause its
                       ------------------
Subsidiaries to, execute such further documents and instruments and take such
further actions as may reasonably be requested by any other party in order to
consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms hereof.

          Section 7.13 Takeover Statutes. If any "fair price," "moratorium,"
                       -----------------
"control share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or
regulation, including, without limitation, Sections 2541 et. seq., 2551 et. seq.
and 2561 et seq. of the BCL (each, a "Takeover Statute") is or may become
                                      ----------------
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of the Parent and the Company and its Board of Directors shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such

contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize (to
the greatest extent practicable) the effects of such Takeover Statute on such
transactions.

          Section 7.14 Financing.
                       ---------

               (a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Parent expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Parent's and
Merger Sub's obligations hereunder are not conditioned in any manner upon the
Parent or Merger Sub obtaining any financing. The Parent shall keep the Company
apprised of all material developments or changes relating to the Financing
Commitments and the Financing contemplated thereby. The failure, for any reason,
of the Parent and the Merger Sub to have sufficient cash available on the
Closing Date to pay the Merger Consideration in accordance with Article II
hereof and/or the failure to so pay the Merger Consideration on the Closing Date
shall constitute a willful and material breach of this Agreement. In addition,
for the avoidance of doubt, the existence of any conditions contained in the
Financing Commitments or the Financing (including the Equity Contribution
Agreement) shall not constitute, nor be construed to constitute, a condition to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

               (b) The Parent shall use its best reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, and close upon concurrently with the
Closing, the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in or
comparable to the Debt Financing Commitment (provided that the Parent may
terminate and replace or amend the Debt Financing Commitment to add lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not
executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof or otherwise so
long as the terms would not adversely impact the ability of the Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise prevent
or materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain
in effect the Debt Financing Commitment, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to the Parent or Merger Sub to obtaining the Debt
Financing, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms
and conditions contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment or any replacement
commitments or on other terms that would not adversely impact the ability of the
Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv)
consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to Closing. If any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Debt Financing Commitment, the Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. The Parent shall
give the Company prompt notice of any material breach of the Debt Financing
Commitment of which the Parent becomes aware or any termination of the Debt
Financing Commitment. The Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of the efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing and provide copies of all documents related to the
Debt Financing (other than any ancillary documents subject to confidentiality
agreements) to the Company.

               (c) The Parent shall use its best reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, and close upon concurrently with the
Closing, the Equity Financing on the terms and conditions described in or
comparable to the Equity Contribution Agreement (provided that the Parent may,


                                       53
<PAGE>

subject to the terms of the Equity Contribution Agreement, terminate and replace
or amend the Equity Contribution Agreement to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents, or similar entities who had not executed the
Equity Contribution Agreement. As of the date hereof or otherwise so long as the
terms would not adversely impact the ability of the Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise prevent or materially
delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby) including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect
the Equity Contribution Agreement, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to the Parent or Merger Sub to obtaining the Equity Financing, (iii)
enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions
contemplated by the Equity Contribution Agreement or any replacement commitments
or on other terms that would not adversely impact the ability of the Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) consummate
the Equity Financing at or prior to Closing. If any portion of the Equity
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Equity Contribution Agreement, the Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. The Parent shall
give the Company prompt notice of any material breach of the Equity Contribution
Agreement of which the Parent becomes aware or any termination of the Equity
Contribution Agreement. The Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of the efforts to
arrange the Equity Financing and provide copies of all documents related to the
Equity Financing (other than any ancillary documents subject to confidentiality
agreements) to the Company.

               (d) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
to, at the Parent's sole expense (and provided that such requested cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and
the Subsidiaries) use its and their reasonable best efforts to provide such
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by the Parent in connection with the
Financings, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) cause appropriate
officers and employees to be available, on a customary basis and upon reasonable
notice, to meet (including in Australia) with ratings agencies and prospective
lenders and investors in presentations, meetings, and due diligence sessions,
(ii) assist with the preparation of disclosure documents in connection
therewith, (iii) provide financing sources with reasonable access to the
properties, books and records of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, execute
and deliver any customary pledge or security documents or other customary
definitive financing documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested
by the Parent, and (iv) direct its independent accountants and counsel to
provide customary and reasonable assistance to the Parent.

formation, by-laws or limited liability company agreement, or (y) violate any
statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or
body having jurisdiction over the Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective


                                       59
<PAGE>

subsidiaries or any of their properties or assets; (vi) no consent, approval,
authorization, order, filing, registration or qualification of or with any court
or governmental agency or body is required for the execution, delivery and
performance by the Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement or the consummation
by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except such as
have been obtained and are in effect; and (vii) neither the Parent nor Merger
Sub is, and solely after giving effect to the Merger, will be an "investment
company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940.

               (e) Additional Shareholder Approval. The Merger shall have been
                   -------------------------------
approved by a majority of the votes cast by shares of Disinterested Common Stock
voting at a duly held Company Meeting (a "Disinterested Approval"). As used in
                                          ----------------------

                   --------------
contained in this Section 9.3 are an integral part of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and constitute liquidated damages and not a
penalty. The parties further agree that if one party is or becomes obligated to

termination fee shall be the sole remedy of the other party with respect to the
facts and circumstances giving rise to such payment obligation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.3, if one party fails to
promptly pay to the other any fee or expense due under Section 9.3(a) or (b), in

                                                 --------  -------
event shall the liability of Parent and Merger Sub arising out of or relating to
any such breaches exceed an aggregate of $70 million (the "Default Amount"),
                                                           --------------
which amount is deposited in cash and/or letters of credit as of the date hereof
in the Escrow Account (as defined in the Equity Contribution Agreement) pursuant
to the terms of the escrow agreement contemplated by the Equity Contribution
Agreement, and provided, further, that under no circumstances shall any investor
in, or advisor to, Parent or Merger Sub have any liability to the Company

                      ------

obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein, to the extent permitted by applicable
law. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.
