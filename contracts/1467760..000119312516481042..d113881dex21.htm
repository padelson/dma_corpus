policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
Parent; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Parent&#146;s management has

periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to Parent&#146;s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii) has not had (A) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Parent&#146;s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
