as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGERS

Section 1.1  _The Mergers_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the MGCL, at the First
Merger Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company,
whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease, with the Company
surviving the First Merger (the Company, as the surviving corporation in the
First Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the " _First Merger
Surviving Entity_ "), such that following the First Merger, the First Merger
Surviving Entity will be a Subsidiary of Parent. The First Merger shall have
the effects provided in this Agreement and as specified in the MGCL.

(b) Promptly following the First Merger Effective Time, and in accordance
with this Agreement and the MGCL, the First Merger Surviving Entity shall be
merged with and into Parent, whereupon the separate existence of the First
Merger Surviving Entity will cease, with Parent surviving the Second Merger
(Parent, as the surviving corporation in the Second Merger, sometimes being
referred to herein as the " _Second Merger Surviving Entity_ "). The Second
Merger shall have the effects provided in this Agreement and as specified
in the MGCL.

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Mergers (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, at the offices of Fried, Frank,

second (2nd) Business Day after the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted
hereunder, waiver of the last of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ to
be satisfied or waived by the Party entitled to the benefit of the same (other
than any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted
hereunder, waiver of such conditions at the Closing), unless another date or
place is agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion, elect to postpone the Closing
for up to an additional five (5) Business Days

 



2  following such date; _provided_ _further_ that (i) if Parent elects to
postpone the Closing beyond such second (2nd) Business Day in accordance with
the preceding proviso, Parent shall have no right, after such second (2nd)
Business Day, to assert or claim that a Company Material Adverse Effect (or
Events giving rise thereto) has occurred or would occur, and (ii) Parent
shall have no right to postpone the Closing beyond such second Business Day
if, as a result of such postponement, the Closing would occur on or after the
Outside Date. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred
to as the " _Closing Date_."

Section 1.3 _Effective Times_. On the Closing Date, the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub, as applicable, shall (i) cause articles of merger in substantially
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B-1_ (the " _First Merger Articles of
Merger_ ") with respect to the First Merger to be duly executed, filed with
and accepted for record by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of
Maryland (the " _SDAT_ ") in accordance with the MGCL, (ii) cause articles of
merger in substantially the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit B-2_ (the "
_Second Merger Articles of Merger_ " and together with the First Merger
Articles of Merger, the " _Articles of Merger_ ") with respect to the Second
Merger to be duly executed, filed with and accepted for record by the SDAT in
accordance with the MGCL and (iii) duly make any other filings, recordings or
publications required to be made by Parent, the Company or Merger Sub under
the MGCL in connection with the Mergers. The First Merger shall become
effective at the latest of such time as the First Merger Articles of Merger
have been accepted for record by the SDAT or on such other date and time (not
to exceed thirty (30) days from the date that the First Merger Articles
of Merger have been accepted for record by the SDAT) as shall be agreed to by
the Company and Parent and specified in the First Merger Articles of Merger
(such date and time of effectiveness of the First Merger Articles of Merger
being hereinafter referred to as the " _First Merger Effective Time_ ") and
the Second Merger shall become effective promptly following the First Merger
Effective Time and in any event on the same Business Day as the First Merger
Effective Time (the " _Second Merger Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Effects of Mergers_. The Mergers shall have the
effects specified in the applicable provisions of the MGCL, this Agreement
and the Articles of Merger. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
and subject thereto, (i) from and after the First Merger Effective Time, the
First Merger Surviving Entity shall possess all properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, and all of
the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Company and
Merger Sub shall become the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and
duties of the First Merger Surviving Entity and (ii) from and after the Second
Merger Effective Time, the Second Merger Surviving Entity shall possess all
properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Parent and the First
Merger Surviving Entity, and all of the claims, obligations, liabilities,
debts and duties of the Parent and the First Merger Surviving Entity shall
become the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Second
Merger Surviving Entity.

Section 1.5 _Governing Documents_.

 

(a) At the First Merger Effective Time, the charter of the First Merger
Surviving Entity shall be the charter of the Company, as in

(b) At the Second Merger Effective Time, the charter of the Second Merger
Surviving Entity shall be the charter of Parent, as in effect immediately

3 Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of each Surviving Entity_.

 

(a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the First Merger
Effective Time shall be and become the directors of the First
Merger Surviving Entity as of the First Merger Effective Time, each to hold

Time continue to be the officers of the Second Merger Surviving Entity as of

Section 1.7 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, (i) the First Merger shall be treated as a taxable purchase by
Parent of the Company Common Stock and (ii) the Second Merger shall be treated
as a liquidation of the First Merger Surviving Entity pursuant to Section 332
of the Code.

 

Section 1.8 _Transaction Structure_. In the event the Parent Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, to effect
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement through an alternative
structure (including without limitation a share exchange), then, subject to
the prior written consent of the Company (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Parties shall implement
the alternative structure and make such modifications to this Agreement as
necessary to effect such alternative structure.

 

Section 1.9 _Further Assurances_. At and after the First Merger Effective
Time, the officers and directors of Parent, Merger Sub or the First Merger
Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall be authorized to execute and deliver,
in the name and on behalf of the First Merger Surviving Entity, Merger Sub,
Parent or the Company, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances
and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the First Merger Surviving
Entity, Merger Sub, Parent or the Company, any other actions and things
necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the First
Merger Surviving Entity, Merger Sub or Parent any and all right, title and
interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or
to be acquired by the First Merger Surviving Entity, Merger Sub or Parent, as

indirectly, by any Company Subsidiary, Parent, Merger Sub or by any of their
respective Subsidiaries immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(iv) _Treatment of Merger Sub Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
First Merger Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the First Merger Surviving
Entity. 

(v) _Adjustments_. The Per Common Share Merger Consideration shall be adjusted
appropriately and proportionately to reflect fully the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange
of shares or other similar transaction at any time during the period from the
date hereof to the First Merger Effective Time which changes the number of
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding, in each case other than
pursuant to the Transactions after the date hereof and prior to the First
Merger Effective Time.

 



5 (b) At the Second Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and
without any further action on the part of the holders of any securities of
Parent or the First Merger Surviving Entity:

(i) _Cancellation of First Merger Surviving Entity Common Stock_. All shares
of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the First Merger Surviving
Entity and any other securities representing stock in the First Merger
Surviving Entity owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or by any of its
respective Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(ii) _Treatment of Company Series A Preferred Stock_. Each share of Company
Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Second Merger Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and become
the right to receive one newly issued share of Parent Series C Preferred Stock
(the " _Per Preferred Share Merger Consideration_ " and collectively, the "
_Preferred Stock Merger Consideration_ "). From and after the Second Merger
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a share of Company Series A Preferred Stock shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Per Preferred Share Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
share of Company Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with _Section 2.2_.

Section 2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent or Merger Sub shall
designate an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the paying
and exchange agent in connection with the Mergers (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").
On the Closing Date, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock in book-entry form equal to the Stock Consideration, (ii)
evidence of a number of shares of Parent Series C Preferred Stock in book-
entry form issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)(ii)_ sufficient in order for
the Exchange Agent to distribute the Per Preferred Share Merger Consideration,
and (iii) cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient for the
Exchange Agent to distribute the Aggregate Cash Consideration and the
Adjustment Amount (such evidence of book-entry shares of Parent Common Stock
and Parent Series C Preferred Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange
Agent, collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock or holders of shares
of Company Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable. In addition, Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time thereafter,
any Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(f) or Section 2.2(g)_. In the event the cash
portion of the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the Aggregate Cash
Consideration and Adjustment Amount, Parent shall promptly deposit additional
funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in
the amount required for the Exchange Agent to make such payments. Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make delivery
of the Aggregate Cash Consideration, Stock Consideration, the Adjustment
Amount, the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration and payment of all other
amounts required to be paid out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this
Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, Parent

 



6  shall enter into an Exchange Agent Agreement with the Exchange Agent, in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Company, setting forth the procedures to be
used in accomplishing the deliveries and other actions contemplated by this
_Section 2.2_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not
expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange
Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent
in accordance with the Exchange Agent Agreement. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent on the earlier of (i)
six (6) months after the Closing Date or (ii) the full payment of the
Aggregate Cash Consideration and Adjustment Amount, if any.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) _Company Common Stock_. Promptly after the First Merger Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and make available for
collection by hand) to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates
which immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time represented
outstanding Company Common Shares (the " _Common Certificates_ ") or non-
certificated Company Common Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry
Common Shares_ ") and whose Company Common Shares were converted pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)_ into the right to receive the Per Common Share Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Common Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer
of the Book-Entry Common Shares to the Exchange Agent and which shall
otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Common Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Common Shares in exchange for payment of the Per Common Share Merger
Consideration, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.6_. Upon (i) surrender to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent
of a Common Certificate for cancellation (or an affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of a Book-Entry Common Share,
together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Common
Certificate or Book-Entry Common Share shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Per Common Share Merger Consideration in respect of
each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Common
Certificate or Book-Entry Common Share pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_ , including any Fractional Share Consideration that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.6_. The
Parent Common Stock constituting part of the Per Common Share Merger
Consideration shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a
physical certificate is requested by a holder of Company Common Stock or is
otherwise required under applicable Law. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Common Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Common Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as
the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment of the Per Common Share
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor is registered,
it shall be a condition precedent of payment that either the Common
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or such Common
Certificate (or affidavit of

 



7  loss in lieu thereof) shall otherwise be in proper form for the transfer or
such Book-Entry Common Share shall be properly transferred. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_ , each Common Certificate and Book-
Entry Common Share shall be deemed at any time after the First Merger
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable Per
Common Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this  _Article II_,
including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.6_, and any dividends or other distributions on
shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with  _Section 2.2(f)_, without
interest thereon. The issuance or payment of the Per Common Share Merger
Consideration and the payment of any Fractional Share Consideration pursuant
to _Section 2.6_ in respect of Parent Common Stock in accordance with this
Agreement shall be deemed issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Company Common Stock (other than the right to receive
dividends or other distributions, if any, in accordance with  _Section
2.2(f)_).

(ii) _Company Series A Preferred Stock_. Promptly after the Second Merger
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and make
available for collection by hand) to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock (the "
_Preferred Certificates_ ") or non-certificated shares of Company Series A
Preferred Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Preferred Shares_ ")
and whose shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock were converted pursuant
to _Section 2.1(b)_ into the right to receive the Per Preferred Share Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Preferred Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
transfer of the Book-Entry Preferred Shares to the Exchange Agent and which
shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Preferred Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Preferred Shares in exchange for payment of the Per Preferred Share
Merger Consideration. Upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent of a Preferred Certificate
for cancellation (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or (ii) receipt of
an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any,
of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a
book-entry transfer of a Book-Entry Preferred Share, together with a letter of
transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Preferred Certificate or Book-Entry
Preferred Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per
Preferred Share Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company
Series A Preferred Stock formerly represented by such Preferred Certificate or
Book-Entry Preferred Share pursuant to the provisions of this  _Article II_.
The Parent Series C Preferred Stock constituting the Per Preferred Share
Merger Consideration shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a
physical certificate is requested by a holder of Company Preferred Stock or
is otherwise required under applicable Law. The Exchange Agent shall accept
such Preferred Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Preferred Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment of the Per
Preferred Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Company Series A Preferred Stock surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment
that either the Preferred Certificate so surrendered shall be properly

 



8  endorsed or such Preferred Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) shall otherwise be in proper form for the transfer or such Book-Entry
Preferred Share shall be properly transferred. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.2_ , each Preferred Certificate and Book-Entry
Preferred Share shall be deemed at any time after the Second Merger Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable Per Preferred
Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_ , and any
dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Series C Preferred Stock
in accordance with _Section 2.2(g)_ , without interest thereon. The issuance
or payment of the Per Preferred Share Merger Consideration in accordance with
this Agreement shall be deemed issued and paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Company Series A Preferred Stock (other than the
right to receive dividends or other distributions, if any, in accordance with
_Section 2.2(g)_ ).

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. At the
First Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock on the records of
the Company. From and after the First Merger Effective Time, with respect to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the First Merger Effective Time and, from and after the Second Merger
Effective Time, with respect to the holders of shares of Company Series A
Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective
Time, such holders shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company
Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock except as otherwise provided
for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Second Merger Effective Time,
Common Certificates, Preferred Certificates, Book-Entry Common Shares or Book-
Entry Preferred Shares are presented to the Second Merger Surviving Entity
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

(d)  _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, Parent shall be entitled to require
the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not been
disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Exchange
Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of Common Certificates,
Preferred Certificates, Book-Entry Common Shares or Book-Entry Preferred
Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditor thereof with respect to the applicable Per Common Share Merger
Consideration or Per Preferred Share Merger Consideration, including any
amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.6_ , and any dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_ or on the Parent Series C
Preferred Stock in accordance with _Section 2.2(g),_ payable upon due
surrender of their Common Certificates, Preferred Certificates, Book-Entry
Common Shares or Book-Entry Preferred Shares, as applicable, and compliance
with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_ , without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any holder of a Common Certificate, Preferred Certificate, Book-
Entry Common Share or Book-Entry Preferred Share for any Per Common Share
Merger Consideration, Per Preferred Share Merger Consideration or other
amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 



9 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Common
Certificates or Preferred Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, (ii) delivery for the benefit of Parent of a bond or indemnity in an
amount and upon terms reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent and (iii)
execution and delivery by such Person of a letter of transmittal, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Common
Certificates or Preferred Certificates, the applicable Per Common Share
Merger Consideration or Per Preferred Share Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock
represented by such Common Certificates or Preferred Certificates, pursuant
to _Section 2.1_ , including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.6_ , and any dividends or other
distributions (x) on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with 
_Section 2.2(f)_ or (y) on shares of Parent Series C Preferred Stock in
accordance with _Section 2.2(g)_.

(f) _Dividends with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
First Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Common Certificate or Book-Entry Common Share with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other
distributions shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be
included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such
Common Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Common
Share in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Common Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Common Share there shall be paid to the holder thereof,
without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the First Merger Effective Time theretofore paid with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
First Merger Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment
date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of
Parent Common Stock.

 

(g) _Dividends with Respect to Parent Series C Preferred Stock_. No dividends
or other distributions with respect to Parent Series C Preferred Stock with a
record date after the Second Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Preferred Certificate or Book-Entry Preferred Share with
respect to the shares of Parent Series C Preferred Stock issuable hereunder,
and all such dividends and other distributions shall be paid by Parent to the
Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until
the surrender of such Preferred Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Preferred Share in accordance with this Agreement.
Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Preferred
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Preferred
Share there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i) the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Second
Merger Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent
Series C Preferred Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this
Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Second Merger Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent Series C Preferred
Stock.

 



10 Section 2.3 _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall
be available with respect to the Mergers or the other Transactions.

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Company Restricted Shares; and DRIP_. 

(a) Immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time, with respect to each
outstanding share of restricted stock or each outstanding restricted stock
unit that settles in shares of Company Common Stock, in each case that vest
upon continued service under the Company Equity Plan (each a " _Company
Restricted Share_ "), the restrictions and vesting conditions applicable to
such Company Restricted Share shall lapse and each such Company Restricted
Share shall, by virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, be converted as of the First Merger Effective Time into
the right to receive, with respect to the share of Company Common Stock
underlying such Company Restricted Share, the Per Common Share Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.1_ , less applicable Tax
withholdings. Applicable Tax withholdings with respect to the converted
Company Restricted Shares first shall reduce the Per Share Common Cash Merger
Consideration received with respect to the Exchanged Restricted Shares held by
an individual holder and then shall reduce the Per Share Common Stock Merger
Consideration, with the value of any tax withholdings that reduce the Per
Share Common Stock Merger Consideration to be based on the Parent Stock Price.
For the purposes of this _Section 2.4(a)_ , " _Parent Stock Price_ " means
the average of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices of Parent
Common Stock on the NYSE (as reported by Bloomberg L.P.) on each of the five
(5) consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to the Closing
Date.

(b) Prior to the First Merger Effective Time, the Company shall adopt
resolutions and take all necessary and appropriate actions to (i) effectuate
the treatment of the Company Restricted Shares as contemplated by this
_Section 2.4_ and (ii) provide that, as of the First Merger Effective Time,
the Company Equity Plan shall terminate and all rights under any provision of
any other plan, program or arrangement of the Company providing for the
issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock or
other equity interests of the Company shall be cancelled without obligation
(including any payment ) of the Company other than as expressly provided
herein.

(c) The Company Board has, no later than the date hereof, taken all actions
to either (i) suspend or terminate the DRIP, and following such suspension or
termination, will not issue any shares of Company Common Stock under the DRIP
or (ii) elect to satisfy the obligations to provide Company Common Stock
pursuant to the DRIP through open market purchases rather than new share
issuances.

Section 2.5 _Withholding_. Any payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall
be net of all applicable withholding Taxes that Parent, Merger Sub, the First
Merger Surviving Entity, the Second Merger Surviving Entity and the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, shall be required to deduct and withhold under
applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the
applicable payor and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 



11 Section 2.6 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip or book-entry
securities representing less than one (1) share of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued in the First Merger upon the surrender for exchange of Common
Certificates or Book-Entry Common Shares, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the First
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without
interest, representing such holders proportionate interest, if any, in the
proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced by any fees of the
Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in one or more transactions of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate number
of shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by
Parent pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(i)_ over (ii) the aggregate number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to holders of Company
Common Stock pursuant to _Sections 2.1_ and _2.2(b)(i)_ (such excess being,
the " _Excess Shares_ "). The Parties acknowledge that payment of the cash
consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares was not separately
bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would
otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the
holders of the certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock that
would otherwise receive fractional shares, shall sell the Excess Shares at
then prevailing prices on the NYSE (or such other market in which the Parent
Common Stock then trades).

(a) Since January 1, 2013, Parent has designed and maintained a system of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, and
includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent and its consolidated

recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Parent; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. Parents management
has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parents system of
internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015, and, except as set forth in Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the

Parent maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2015. Since January 1, 2013, Parent (i) has designed and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated
and communicated to Parents management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii) has not had (A) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect the Parents ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parents internal controls over financial reporting.

to (i) any "off balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii)
of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act) or (ii) any commitment
to become party to any joint venture, off balance sheet partnership or any
similar Contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship
between or among Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, in each case where
the results, purpose or effect of such commitment or arrangement is to avoid

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in Parents or such Subsidiaries published
financial statements or other Parent SEC Documents.

liabilities that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

service of process has been received by Parent) against (or to Parents
knowledge, threatened against or naming as a party thereto), Parent, a Parent

Day after the date on which the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained; and
(E) any dividend which the Parent Board determines is or may be necessary to
be authorized and declared to enable Parent to maintain its qualification as a

dividends under Code Sections 858 or 860, with respect to 2016;

of Section 856 of the Code, as the case may be;

 

(g) take any action that could reasonably be expected to, or fail to take any
action, the failure of which could reasonably be expected to, cause Parent to
fail to qualify as a REIT;

(h) change an annual accounting period or change in any material respect any
of the accounting methods used by it materially affecting its assets,
liabilities or business, except for such changes required by GAAP or
applicable Laws;

in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent from taking any action, at any time

ending on or prior to the First Merger Effective Time, (ii) avoid incurring
U.S. federal, state or local income or excise Taxes under the Code or

Section 5.3 _Acquisition Proposals; Go-Shop Period_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on April 1, 2016 (the " _Go-Shop Period_ "),
the Company and its Subsidiaries and

 



45  their respective Representatives shall have the right to: (i) initiate,
solicit, facilitate and encourage (publicly or otherwise) any inquiry or the
making of any proposals or offers that constitute, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, including by way of providing
access to non-public information to any Person and its Representatives, its
affiliates and its prospective equity and debt financing sources, provided
that prior to furnishing such information, the Company has entered into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person, and _further_ ,
_provided_ , that the Company shall promptly make available to Parent
any non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that
the Company provides to any Person given such access if such information was
not previously made available to Parent, and (ii) engage or enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any
Persons or groups of Persons and their Representatives, their affiliates and
their prospective equity and debt financing sources with respect to any
Acquisition Proposals or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate
in, or facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations
or any effort or attempt to make any Acquisition Proposals.

 

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_ (including _Section
5.3(d)_ ) and except as may relate to any Excluded Party (for so long as such
Person remains an Excluded Party), the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective officers and directors shall, and the Company shall instruct and
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause, its and its Subsidiaries
other Representatives (including by notifying them of the existence and terms
of this _Section 5.3(b)_ ) to (i) at 12:01 a.m. on April 2, 2016 (the " _No-
Shop Period Start Date_ "), immediately cease any solicitation activity with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any discussions or negotiations with any
Persons that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and the
Company shall request that each Person (other than an Excluded Party for so
long as such Person is an Excluded Party, and except as otherwise permitted
pursuant to the terms of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) promptly
return to the Company or destroy any non-public information previously
furnished or made available to it or any of its Representatives by or on
behalf of the Company or its Representatives, and immediately terminate access
of any Person (other than an Excluded Party for so long as such Person is an
Excluded Party) to any electronic data room maintained by the Company with
respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) from the
No-Shop Period Start Date until the earlier of the First Merger Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, not,
directly or indirectly, (A) initiate, solicit, knowingly facilitate or
knowingly encourage (publicly or otherwise) any inquiries regarding, or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (B) furnish any non-public
information regarding the Company to any Person, or (C) engage in, enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or provide any information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries or afford access to the Companys or its Subsidiaries books,
records, management, employees or properties to any Person (other than
discussions in the ordinary course of business that are unrelated to an
Acquisition Proposal).

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within three (3)
Business Days following the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, the Company
will provide Parent with a written list identifying each Excluded Party.

 



46 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to
the last sentence of this _Section 5.3(d)_ , at any time following the No-
Shop Period Start Date and prior to the time, but not after, the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ have been satisfied, if the Company receives an
Acquisition Proposal from any Person or group of Persons which has not
resulted from a violation of this _Section 5.3_ , subject to compliance with
this _Section 5.3(d)_ , (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
Representatives may contact such Person or group of Persons solely to clarify
the terms and conditions thereof, (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives may provide non-public information and data
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Person or group
of Persons and their Representatives, their affiliates and their prospective
equity and debt financing sources provided that prior to furnishing such
information, the Company has entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement with such Person;  _provided_ , that the Company shall promptly
(and in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) make available to Parent any
non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that the
Company made available to any Person given such access if such information
was not previously made available to Parent, and (iii) the Company and its
Representatives may engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations
with such Person or group of Persons if and only to the extent that, the
Company Board, or any committee thereof, has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized third
party financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes
a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be likely to result in a Superior
Proposal. The Company shall give written notice to Parent before taking any of
the actions described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence. In
no event may the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives
directly or indirectly reimburse or pay, or agree to reimburse or pay, the
fees, costs or expenses of, or provide or agree to provide compensation to,
any Person or Persons (or any of their Representatives or potential financing
sources) who make an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the occurrence of
the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives may continue to engage in the activities described
in _Section 5.3(a)_ with any Excluded Party (for so long as such party remains
an Excluded Party), including with respect to any amended Acquisition Proposal
submitted by such Excluded Party, following the No-Shop Period Start Date,
and the restrictions in _Section 5.3(b)_ shall not apply with respect thereto.

(e) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.

(i) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.3(e)_ , or _Section 5.3(f)_ or 
_8.3(a)_ , the Company Board and each committee thereof shall not:

(A) withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify (or publicly propose or
resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify), in any manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation or approve, authorize,
adopt or recommend or otherwise declare advisable, or propose publicly to
approve, authorize, adopt or recommend or otherwise declare advisable, any
Acquisition Proposal or fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement when filed (each action set forth in this clause (A), a "
_Change of Recommendation_ ");

 



47 (B) take any action to make the provisions of any "fair price", "moratorium",
"control share acquisition", "business combination" or other similar anti-
takeover statute or regulation inapplicable to any transaction contemplated by
an Acquisition Proposal;

 

(C) except as expressly permitted by _Section 8.3(a)_ , authorize, adopt,
approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, memorandum of understanding or definitive merger, acquisition,
purchase or joint venture agreement or other similar Contract (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) in respect of or relating to any
Acquisition Proposal.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if
at any time after the date hereof but prior to the time the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board or an authorized committee
thereof has received an Acquisition Proposal (which did result from a
violation of this _Section 5.3_ ) that the Company Board, or an authorized
committee thereof, determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel and a nationally recognized third party financial advisor)
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board, and or such authorized
committee thereof, prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained, may effect a Change of Recommendation and may also terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ (a " _Fiduciary Termination_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not effect a Change of
Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or effect a Fiduciary
Termination pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ with respect to a Superior Proposal
unless: (w) the Company Board, or an authorized committee thereof, determines
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors duties
under applicable Law; (x) the Company notifies Parent in writing, at least
five (5) Business Days in advance, that it intends to effect a Change of
Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or effect a Fiduciary
Termination pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ with respect to a Superior
Proposal, which notice shall specify all material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal, including the identity of the Person who made such
Superior Proposal, the type and amount of consideration that the Companys
stockholders will receive and all other terms and conditions which the
Company Board considered in making the determination that such Acquisition
Proposal constituted a Superior Proposal, and any other information and
material required to be delivered under _Section 5.3(a)_  or _5.3(d)_ , as
applicable, that has not yet been provided to Parent; (y) after providing such
notice and prior to making such Change of Recommendation in connection with a
Superior Proposal or effecting a Fiduciary Termination pursuant to  _Section
8.3(a)_ with respect to a Superior Proposal, if requested by Parent, the
Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and
Parents Representatives during such five (5) Business Day period to make
such revisions to the terms of this Agreement so that such Acquisition
Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and (z) the Company Board,
or an authorized committee thereof, after taking into consideration any
changes to this Agreement offered in writing by Parent in a manner that would
form a binding contract if accepted by the Company, continues to believe in
its good faith business judgment (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and a nationally recognized third party financial advisor) that the
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure to effect a Change
of Recommendation in connection with such Superior Proposal or effect a
Fiduciary Termination pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ with respect to such
Superior Proposal would be

 



48  inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law. Any amendment
to the financial or other material terms of such Superior Proposal or an
amendment to an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board had determined no
longer constitutes a Superior Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition
Proposal and shall require the Company to deliver a new notice pursuant to
clause (x) above, and the Company shall again be required to comply with the
requirements of this _Section 5.3(e)(ii)_ , except that the references to five
(5) Business Days shall be deemed to be references to three (3) Business Days.
Except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 5.3(e)_ ,
the Company shall have no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.3(a)_.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
at any time prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained,
the Company Board, and any authorized committee thereof, may effect a Change
of Recommendation in the absence of a Superior Proposal if an Intervening
Event shall have occurred and be continuing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be permitted to effect a Change of Recommendation in
connection with an Intervening Event unless: (w) the Company Board, or an
authorized committee thereof, determines in its good faith business judgment
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that, in light of such
Intervening Event, the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors duties under applicable Law; (x) the Company notifies Parent in
writing, at least five (5) Business Days in advance, which notice shall (1)
state that an Intervening Event has occurred and that the Company Board, or
such authorized committee thereof, has determined that in light of such
Intervening Event, the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law and that the
Company intends to take such action and (2) describe the Intervening Event in
reasonable detail and advise Parent that it intends to take such action and
specify, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such action; (y) after
providing such notice and prior to making such Change of Recommendation in
connection with an Intervening Event, if requested by Parent, the Company
shall negotiate in good faith with Parent during such five (5) Business Day
period, making such revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
so that the failure to make such Change of Recommendation would no longer be
inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law; and (z) the
Company Board, or an authorized committee thereof, after taking into
consideration any changes to this Agreement offered in writing by Parent in a
manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company,
continues to believe in its good faith business judgment (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect a Change of
Recommendation with respect to such Intervening Event would still be
inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law. For the
avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 5.3(e)_ shall also apply
to any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such
Intervening Event and require a new notice, except that the references to five
(5) Business Days shall be deemed to be references to three (3) Business Days.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Company Board, or any committee thereof, from (i) complying
with its disclosure obligations under United States federal or state law with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d9 and Rule
14e2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
shareholders), or (ii) making any "stoplookandlisten" communication to the
shareholders

 



49  of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communications to the shareholders of the Company); _provided_
, that any such disclosure or communication that constitutes or contains a
Change of Recommendation shall be subject to the provisions of Section 5.3(e).

(g) From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company agrees that (i)
it will promptly (and, in any event, within thirty-six (36) hours) notify
Parent orally and in writing if any Acquisition Proposal is received by it
indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the Person making
the Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof
(including, if applicable, copies of any written documentation or
correspondence constituting the Acquisition Proposal, including proposed
agreements) and (ii) in the event that any such Person modifies its
Acquisition Proposal in any material respect, the Company shall notify Parent
within one (1) Business Day after receipt of such modified Acquisition
Proposal of the fact that such Acquisition Proposal has been modified and the
terms of such modification (including, if applicable, copies of any written
documentation or correspondence reflecting such modification); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that none of the requirements contemplated by the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) shall apply (x) during the Go-Shop Period or (y) to any
Acquisition Proposal submitted by an Excluded Party. The Company agrees that
it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any
confidentiality agreement subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the
Company from providing to Parent such material terms and conditions and other
information contemplated by this _Section 5.3_ , and represents, as of the
date hereof, that none of the Company or its Subsidiaries is bound by a
confidentiality agreement which prohibits the Company from providing such
information to Parent.

 

(h) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any actions taken by or at the
direction of a Representative of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries that, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach
or violation of this _Section 5.3_ will be deemed to constitute a breach and
violation of this _Section 5.3_ by the Company.

 

Section 5.4 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement; Stockholders
Meetings_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, (i) the Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement in preliminary
form, and (ii) Parent shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, the
Form S-4 with respect to the Parent Common Stock issuable in the First Merger
and the Parent Series C Preferred Stock issuable in the Second Merger, which
will include the Proxy Statement and a prospectus of Parent; _provided_ ,
however, that unless Parent and the Company otherwise agree in writing, in no
event shall the Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 be filed prior to the No-Shop
Period Start Date. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (x) have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC and the
Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, (y) ensure that the Proxy Statement and Form
S-4 comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Exchange Act or Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and
(z) keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary to complete the
First Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly furnish all
information concerning itself, its affiliates, its respective Manager and the
holders of its stock to the other and provide such other assistance as may
be reasonably requested in connection with

 



50  the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Proxy
Statement. Subject to _Section 5.3(e)_ , the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement
shall include all information reasonably requested by such other Party to be
included therein. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the
other upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the
SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement, and
shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other
with copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with
respect to the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 received from the SEC and
advise the other Party of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement or the Form S-4 received from the SEC. Each of the Company and
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly
as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement, and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond
as promptly as practicable to any comment from the SEC with respect to the
Form S-4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the
SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and
provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response (including the proposed final version of such document or
response) and shall, subject to _Section 5.3(e)_ , give due consideration to
including in such document or response any comments reasonably proposed by the
other. Each of Parent and the Company shall advise the other, promptly after
it receives notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the
issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Common Stock of Parent Series C Preferred Stock
issuable in connection with the Mergers for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, and each of Parent and the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed
or otherwise terminated. Parent and the Company shall also take any
other action required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder, the MGCL and the rules of the NYSE in connection
with the filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement and the Form S-4, and
the solicitation of proxies from Company stockholders thereunder.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish to the other
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, its Manager, its
directors, officers and (to the extent reasonably available to the applicable
party) stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application made
by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to the NYSE or any Governmental Entity (including the Form S-4
and the Proxy Statement) in connection with the First Merger and the other
Transactions. In addition, the Company will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) provide interim financial statements of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (including footnotes) that are required by the Securities
Act to be included in the Form S-4 that have been reviewed by the Companys
independent registered public accounting firm, (ii) provide managements
discussion and analysis of interim and annual consolidated financial
statements, (iii) cause the Companys independent registered
public accounting firm to consent to the inclusion or incorporation by
reference of the audit reports on the annual audited consolidated financial
statements of the Company included in the Form S-4, and (iv) provide
information concerning the Company necessary to enable Parent and the Company
to prepare required pro forma financial statements and related footnotes, in
each case,

 



51  to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Parent to prepare the Form S-4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as required by applicable Law,
neither party shall furnish any information that is the subject of any
confidentiality agreement with any third party (provided that the withholding
party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent
of such third party with respect to furnishing such information) or subject
to any attorney client privilege (provided that the withholding party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to permit the furnishing of such
information in a manner that does not result in loss or waiver of privilege).

 

(c) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement,
so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Parties, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to,
the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and, to the extent required by Law, in
disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to
stockholders of the Company and the stockholders of Parent. Nothing in this
_Section 5.4(c)_ shall limit the obligations of any Party under  _Section
5.4(a)_. For purposes of this _Section 5.4_ , any non-public information
concerning or related to the Company, its affiliates or the Stockholders
Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the Company, and any non-
public information concerning or related to Parent or its affiliates will be
deemed to have been provided by Parent.

(d) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the effectiveness of the
Form S-4, the Company, acting through the Company Board, or an authorized
committee thereof, in accordance with applicable Law and its charter and
bylaws, shall, in consultation with Parent, (i) establish a record date for
and give notice of, a meeting of holders of Company Common Stock (the "
_Stockholders Meeting_ ") at which meeting the Company shall seek the Company
Stockholder Approval, which record date shall be no later than ten (10) days
after the later of (x) the date on which the Proxy Statement is cleared by the
SEC and (y) the date of which the Form S-4 is declared effective (or such
later time as may be required by applicable Law), (ii) cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the record holders as of the record date
established for the Stockholders Meeting and (iii) within thirty (30) days of
such record date, duly call, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting;
_provided_ , that, the Company shall be permitted to postpone the
Stockholders Meeting, or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting beyond the time that
the Stockholders Meeting would otherwise be held, only (A) with the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and (B) if there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) in order to approve
the First Merger in accordance with the MGCL and this Agreement or
to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Stockholders
Meeting, or (C) if required by applicable Law. In the event that the date of
the Stockholders Meeting as originally called is for any reason adjourned,
postponed or otherwise delayed, the Company agrees that unless Parent shall
have otherwise approved in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), it shall use commercially reasonable 

 



52  efforts to implement such adjournment, postponement or other delay in such a
way that the Company does not establish a new record date for the Stockholders
Meeting, as so adjourned, postponed or delayed except for such new record
date as required by applicable Law. Subject to _Section 5.3_ , the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or
advisable on its part to cause the Company Stockholder Approval to be received
at the Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Unless
this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to _Section 8.3_ , the Companys
obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting
in accordance with the foregoing sentence of this _Section 5.4(d)_ shall apply
notwithstanding the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of
any Acquisition Proposal to the Company, the Company Board, its
Representatives or the Stockholders of the Company, or by any Change in
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.3_ , and, prior to the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.3_ , the Company shall not
submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the
First Merger. Unless the Company Board shall have made a Change in
Recommendation in accordance with _Section 5.3_ , the Proxy Statement shall
include the Company Board Recommendation.

ARTICLE VI

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 6.1 _Access; Confidentiality; Notice of Certain Events_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the First Merger Effective Time or
the earlier date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with _Article VIII_ , subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the other Party and to
the Representatives of such other Party reasonable access during normal
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all of their respective
properties, offices, books, Contracts, personnel and records and, during such
period, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to the other Party all
other information (financial or otherwise) concerning its business, properties
and personnel as such other Party may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Company nor Parent shall be required by this _Section
6.1_ to provide the other Party or the Representatives of such other Party
with access to or to disclose information (x) that is subject to the terms of
a confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent of
such third party to such access or disclosure), (y) the disclosure of which
would violate or contravene any Law or duty ( _provided_ , _however_ , that
the withholding Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make
appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in
violation of any Law or duty) or (z) that is subject to any attorney-client,
attorney work product or other legal privilege of such Party or its
Subsidiaries ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to
the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of any such attorney-client,
attorney work product or other legal privilege). Each of the Company and
Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption
to the businesses of the other Party that may result from the requests for
access, data and information hereunder.

 



53 (b) Each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including
any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ , in confidence to
the extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with,
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

(c) No investigation by either Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives, on
the one hand, or by the Company or its Representatives, on the other, shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the other,
set forth in this Agreement.

(d) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement, the Mergers or the other Transactions, or from any Person alleging

Mergers or the other Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication
or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent could be material to the
Company, the First Merger Surviving Entity or Parent, (ii) of any Legal
Proceeding commenced or, to any Partys knowledge, threatened in writing
against, such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates or
otherwise relating to, involving or affecting such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates, in each case in connection with, arising from or
otherwise relating to the Mergers or any other Transaction, and (iii) if (A)
any representation or warranty made by such Party contained in this Agreement
becomes untrue or inaccurate such that it would be reasonable to expect that
the applicable closing conditions would be incapable of being satisfied by the
Outside Date or (B) such Party fails to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement such that it would be reasonable to
expect that the applicable closing conditions would be incapable of
being satisfied by the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Parties or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties
under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company,
if, to the knowledge of such Party, the occurrence of any state of facts,

satisfied or satisfaction to be materially delayed, as the case may be,
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 6.1(d)_ shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty

forth in _Article VII_.

(e) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it is not
authorized to and shall not (and shall not permit any of its employees,
agents, representatives or Affiliates to) contact any employees, customers,

however that Parent and its employees, agents, representatives or Affiliates
shall not be prohibited from contacting customers, suppliers, distributors or
other material business relations of Parent in the ordinary course of business
and not related to the Company or the Transactions; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives shall
be permitted to contact the employees, customers, suppliers, distributors or
other business relations of the

 



54  Company to the extent contemplated by the arrangements established by the
Parties under _Sections 6.16_ and _6.17_ , but only after prior notice to the
Company, and consultation with the Company regarding the most appropriate
means to contact such persons so as to preserve the Companys relationships
with such persons and not disrupt the business operations of either such
persons or the Company.

 

Section 6.2 _Consents and Approvals_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Company and Parent shall and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries, to use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other Party in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law or pursuant to any contract or agreement to
consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Mergers and the
other Transactions, including (i) the taking of all actions necessary to cause
the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied, (ii)
the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities or other Persons necessary in connection
with the consummation of the Mergers and the other Transactions and the
making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may
be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity or other Persons necessary in
connection with the consummation of the Mergers and the other Transactions,
(iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Mergers or the other Transactions so as to enable the Closing to occur as

additional instruments necessary to consummate the Mergers and the other
Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

(b) Each of the Parties will furnish to the other such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with the
preparation of any required governmental filings or submissions and will
cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Entity, including
promptly informing the other Party of such inquiry, consulting in advance
before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental Entity, and
supplying each other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or
communications between either Party and any Governmental Entity with respect
to this Agreement. The Parties or their Representatives shall have the right
to review in advance, and each of the Parties will consult the others on, any
proposed written or oral communications to, any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Mergers and the other Transactions (other than Tax
Returns), except that confidential competitively sensitive business
information may be redacted from such exchanges, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that outside counsel to the receiving Party shall be permitted to review
complete, unredacted materials. Neither the Company nor Parent shall, nor
shall they permit their respective Representatives to, participate
independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive conversation with
any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or other
inquiry in connection with the Mergers and the other Transactions without
giving the other Party prior notice of such meeting or conversation and, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law and such Governmental Entity, giving
the other Party the opportunity to attend or participate (whether by telephone
or in person) in any such meeting.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than any
Governmental Entity) with respect to the Mergers, the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall not be obligated to,
and shall not without the consent of Parent, pay or commit to pay to such
Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other

accommodations that may be requested or appropriate to obtain such consents.

affiliates, shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or
other announcement with respect to the Mergers or this Agreement without the
prior consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless (a) such Party determines, after
consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or by
any listing agreement with or the rules for listed companies of the NYSE to
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
announcement with respect to the Mergers or this Agreement, in which event
such Party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to
provide a meaningful opportunity to the other Party to review and comment upon
such press release or other announcement and shall give due consideration to
all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto or (b) in the
case of the Company, it deems it necessary or appropriate to issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to
the Mergers, this Agreement or the Transactions in connection with or
following a Change of Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , each Party and
their respective controlled affiliates may make statements that are not
inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by Parent and the Company in compliance with this _Section
6.3_.

 

Section 6.4 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance and
Indemnification_.

 

(a) Parent shall honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the
Company to the fullest extent permissible under applicable Law, under the
Company Governing Documents in effect on the date hereof and under any
indemnification or other similar agreements in effect on the date hereof (the
" _Indemnification Agreements_ ") to the individuals covered by such
Company Governing Documents or Indemnification Agreements (the " _Covered
Persons_ ") arising out of or relating to actions or omissions in their
capacity as such occurring at or prior to the First Merger Effective Time,
including in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
Transactions.

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.4(a)_ , from the
Closing Date until the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent
shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each Covered Person against and from
any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A) any action or
omission or alleged action or omission in such

 



56  Covered Persons capacity as such, or (B) this Agreement and any of the
Transactions; and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the expenses (including
attorneys fees) of any Covered Person upon receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such Covered Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that such Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 6.4_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, Parent shall not settle or compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation of a Covered Person for
which indemnification may be sought under this _Section 6.4(b)_ unless such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional
release of such Covered Person from all liability arising out of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section 6.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, no
Covered Person shall settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation of a Covered Person for which
indemnification may be sought under this _Section 6.4(b)_ without the prior
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned).

 

(c) From the Closing Date until the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Closing
Date, the charter and bylaws of Parent or any of its successors or assigns
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of Covered Persons for periods prior
to and including the First Merger Effective Time than are currently set forth
in the Company Governing Documents. The Indemnification Agreements with
Covered Persons that survive the Mergers shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms.

 

(d) The Company may, prior to Closing, purchase a directors and officers
liability insurance "tail" or "runoff" insurance program for a period of ten
(10) years after the Closing Date with respect to wrongful acts and/or
omissions committed or allegedly committed at or prior to the First Merger
Effective Time (such coverage shall have an aggregate coverage limit over the
term of such policy in an amount not to exceed the annual aggregate coverage
limit under the Companys existing directors and officers liability policy,
and in all other respects shall be comparable to such existing coverage);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the annual cost of such program may not exceed
250% of the annual premiums paid as of the date of this Agreement by the
Company for directors and officers liability insurance (such 250% amount,
the " _Base Premium_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , if such insurance coverage
cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual cost in excess
of the Base Premium, the Company may purchase the most advantageous policies
of "tail" or "run-off" directors and officers insurance obtainable for an
annual cost equal to the Base Premium. If the Company obtains such insurance
policy prior to the First Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause such
policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and shall
honor its obligations thereunder.

 

(e) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such
continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets,
as the case may be, shall assume all of the applicable obligations set forth
in this _Section 6.4_.

 

(f) The Covered Persons (and their successors and heirs) are intended third
party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.4_ , and this  _Section 6.4_ shall
not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (including
their successors and heirs) or terminated without the consent of the Covered
Persons (including their successors and heirs) affected thereby. The
exculpation and indemnification provided for by this _Section 6.4_ shall not
be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which a Covered Person is
entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law, Contract or otherwise.

 



57 Section 6.5 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Mergers or any of the other
Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to
any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Mergers and

the effect of such Takeover Statute on the Mergers and the other
Transactions.

Section 6.6 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action

(including derivative securities) pursuant to the Mergers by each individual
who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.8 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any
Partys rights or obligations under this Agreement, the Parties understand
and agree that (i) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys
operations prior to the First Merger Effective Time, and (ii) prior to the
First Merger Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with and
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over its operations.

to this Agreement, the other transaction documents or any of the contemplated
Transactions is brought against the Company and/or its directors or officers,
the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such litigation and shall keep
Parent informed on a current basis with respect to the status thereof.
The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate, subject to a
customary joint defense agreement, in, but not control, the defense and
settlement of any such litigation against the Company and/or its directors or
officers and no such settlement shall be agreed to by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary without the Parents prior written consent (such consent
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

take any positions inconsistent therewith for U.S. federal, state or
local income tax purposes.

(b) After the First Merger Effective Time through the end of the taxable year
that includes the First Merger Effective Time, Parent shall not, and shall
not permit any Parent Subsidiary to, (i) take any action that reasonably could

with residential mortgage backed securities, securitized mortgage loans, other
mortgage and mortgage related assets or other investment securities (such

effective immediately prior to, and subject to the consummation of, the First
Merger, subject, in each case, to Parent executing, and the continued
accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in the Waiver

in any case, which is in effect and which prevents, prohibits or makes
illegal the consummation of the First Merger, the Second Merger or the other
Transactions.

 



63 Section 7.2 _Conditions to Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. The
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the First Merger are also

Action), _Section 3.23_ (Brokers; Expenses) and _Section 3.25_ (Vote
Required), shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the First Merger Effective Time, as though made as of the
First Merger Effective Time, (ii) the representations and warranties set forth

made as of the First Merger Effective Time, except (x) in each case,
representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date shall be
true and correct only on and as of such date, and (y) in the case of clause
(iii) where the failure of such representations or warranties to be true and

Adverse Effect, and Parent shall have received a certificate signed on behalf
of the Company by a duly authorized executive officer of the Company to the
foregoing effect.

 

(b) _Performance of Obligations of the Company_. The Company shall have

Chance LLP, or such other nationally recognized REIT counsel as may be

delayed, to the effect that, commencing with the Companys taxable year ended
December 31, 2011, the Company has been organized and

 



64  operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation
as a REIT under the Code and its method of operation has enabled the Company
to meet, through the First Merger Effective Time (determined as if the
Companys taxable year ended at the First Merger Effective Time and
disregarding the distribution requirements set forth in Section 857(a)(1) of
the Code for such taxable year), the requirements for qualification and
taxation as a REIT under the Code. Such opinion shall be in a form customary
for transactions of this nature and shall be subject to customary exceptions,
assumptions and qualifications and based on customary
representations contained in the tax representation letter described in
_Section 6.13(b)(ii)_.

(e) _Good Standing Certificates_. The Company shall have delivered to Parent

set forth in _Section 4.3(a)_ (Authorization, Validity of Agreement; Parent
Action) _Section 4.17_ (Brokers; Expenses) and _Section 4.18_ (Sufficiency of
Funds), shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the First Merger Effective Time, as though made as of the
First Merger Effective Time, (ii) the representations and warranties set forth
in the second sentence of _Section 4.2(a)_ (Capital Structure) shall be true
and correct in all but de minimis respects as of the specific date set forth
in such sentence, and (iii) each of the other representations and warranties
of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct
as of the date of this Agreement and as of the First Merger Effective Time, as
though made as of the First Merger Effective Time, except (x) in each case,
representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date shall be
true and correct only on and as of such date, and (y) in the case of clause
(iii) where the failure of such representations or warranties to be true and
correct (without giving effect to any materiality or "Parent Material Adverse
Effect" qualifications set forth therein) would not have or reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, and the Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of
Parent by a duly authorized officer of Parent to the foregoing effect.

of Clifford Chance LLP, or such other nationally recognized REIT counsel as
may be reasonably acceptable to the Company, dated as of the Closing Date, and

effect that, commencing with Parents taxable year ended December 31, 2009,
Parent has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements
for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and its proposed
method of operation will enable Parent to continue to meet the requirements
for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code. Such opinion shall
be in a form customary for transactions of this nature and shall be subject to
customary exceptions, assumptions and qualifications and based on customary
representations contained in the tax representation letters described in 
_Sections 6.13(a)(ii)_ and _6.13(b)(ii_ ).

(d) _No Material Adverse Effect_. Since the date of this Agreement, no
Events shall have occurred, individually or in the aggregate, that constitute
or would (with the passage of time) constitute a Parent Material Adverse
Effect; and the Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of
Parent by a duly authorized executive officer of Parent to such effect.

(e) _Listing / Classification_. The shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent
Series C Preferred Stock to be issued in the Mergers shall have been approved
for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, and the
articles supplementary classifying the Parent Series C Preferred Stock

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION

Section 8.1  _Termination by Mutual Consent_. This Agreement may be
terminated and the Mergers may be abandoned at any time prior to the First
Merger Effective Time, whether before or after the Company Stockholder
Approval is obtained, by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent.

Section 8.2 _Termination by Either Parent or the Company_. This Agreement may
be terminated and the Mergers may be abandoned at any time prior to the First
Merger Effective Time by written notice of either Parent or the Company, if:

 

(a) the First Merger shall not have been consummated by 11:59 p.m. (Eastern
time) on August 26, 2016, whether such date is before or after the date the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained (such date, the " _Initial Outside
Date_ "); _provided_ , however, that if on the Initial Outside Date the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(c)_ shall not have been satisfied but
all other conditions set forth in _Article VII_ shall have been satisfied or
waived or shall then be capable of being satisfied, then either Parent or the
Company may, by written notice to the other Party prior to the Initial Outside
Date, elect to extend the Initial Outside Date to October 26, 2016 (the "
_Second Outside Date_ "). As used in this Agreement, the term " _Outside Date_
" shall mean the Initial Outside Date, unless extended pursuant to
the foregoing sentence, in which case the term "Outside Date" shall mean the
Second Outside Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

 



66  the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.2(a)_ shall not
be available to any Party if the failure of the Closing to occur by such date
shall be due primarily to the failure of such Party to perform any of the
covenants or agreements to be performed by it under this Agreement;

(b) the Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournments and postponements
thereof) shall have been held and completed and the Company Stockholder
Approval or the Company Unaffiliated Stockholder Approval shall not have been
obtained; or

 

(c) any Injunction permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
consummation of the First Merger or the Second Merger shall become final and
non-appealable (whether before or after the Company Stockholder Approval has
been obtained); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Party seeking to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ shall have used commercially
reasonable efforts to appeal, resolve or remove such Injunction.

Section 8.3 _Termination by the Company_. This Agreement may be terminated
and the Mergers may be abandoned by written notice of the Company:

(a) at any time prior to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.1(a)_ if (A) the Company Board, or an authorized committee thereof,
determines or authorizes the Company, subject to complying with the terms of
this Agreement (including _Section 5.3(e)_ ), to enter into definitive
transaction documentation providing for a Superior Proposal (" _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ "), (B) substantially concurrent with or immediately
following the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into such
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal and
(C) substantially concurrent with such termination the Company pays to Parent
in immediately available funds any amounts required to be paid pursuant to 
_Section 8.5_ ;

(b) at any time prior to the First Merger Effective Time if there has been a
breach of any covenant or agreement or there shall be any inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub which breach, either individually or in the aggregate,
would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure
of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _7.3(b)_ and such breach
cannot be or is not cured prior to the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days after
written notice thereof is given by the Company to Parent and (ii) the Outside
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.3(b)_ at any time when it
is in breach of this Agreement and such breach would cause, or result in, the
failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _7.2(b_ ) to
be satisfied; or

(c) if (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ have
been and continue to be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their nature cannot be satisfied other than at Closing), (ii) the Company
has confirmed by written notice to Parent that it stands ready, willing and
able to consummate the First Merger when required pursuant to _Section 1.2_
and (iii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Mergers and other
Transactions within four (4) Business Days of the date the Closing should
have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.2_ (it being understood that during such
four (4) Business Day period, Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement).

 



67 Section 8.4 _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Mergers may be abandoned by written notice of Parent:

(a) at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval if
(i) a Change of Recommendation shall have occurred or the Company shall have
failed to include in the Proxy Statement mailed to each holder of Company
Common Shares the Company Board Recommendation; (ii) the Company shall have
failed to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) Business
Days after both (x) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made public and
(y) receipt by the Company of a written request to do so from Parent; or (iii)
there shall have been a material breach of the provisions of _Section 5.3_ or
_5.4_ which impairs, prevents or materially delays the consummation of the
Transactions and, with respect to _Section 5.4_ , such breaches cannot be or
are not cured reasonably promptly after written notice thereof; or

(b) at any time prior to the First Merger Effective Time if there has been a
breach of any covenant or agreement or there shall be any inaccuracy in the
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
Company, which breach, either individually or in the aggregate, would result
in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _7.2(b)_ , and such breach cannot
be or is not cured prior to the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days after written
notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company and (ii) the Outside Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.4(b)_ at any time when Parent or
Merger Sub is in breach of this Agreement and such breach would cause,
or result in, the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.3(a)_ or _7.3(b)_ to be satisfied.

Section 8.5  _Effect of Termination_.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Mergers pursuant to this  _Article VIII_ , this Agreement shall become void
and of no effect with no liability to any Person on the part of any Party
hereto (or of any of its Representatives or affiliates); _provided_ ,
_however_ , and notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary,
that (i) no such termination shall relieve the Company of any liability to pay
the Termination Fee or Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section 8.5_ , (ii)
subject to the limitations set forth in _Sections 8.5(e)_ and _(f)_ , no such
termination shall relieve or release any of the Parties from any liability or
damages for willful and intentional breach or fraud, (iii) no such termination
shall relieve or release Parent or Merger Sub from any liability or damages
in the event that this Agreement is terminated (x) by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.3(c)_ or (y) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ at any time the
Company had the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
8.3(c)_ and (iv) the agreements of the parties contained in _Section 6.1(b)_ ,
the provisions of this _Section 8.5_ and _Article IX_ shall survive the
termination of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
_Section 8.5(a)_ shall limit or otherwise effect any Partys rights under
_Section 9.14_ , including any Partys rights to specific performance and
other injunctive and equitable relief as provided for therein.

 

(b) In the event that:

(i) (x) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.2(b)_ , and (I) in the case of a termination
pursuant to

 



68   _Section 8.2(b)_ , at or prior to the Stockholders Meeting a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed or announced, and such
Acquisition Proposal shall not have been publicly withdrawn prior to the
Stockholders Meeting, and (II) in the case of a termination pursuant to
_Section 8.2(a)_ , prior to such termination a bona fide Acquisition Proposal
shall have been publicly disclosed or announced, and such Acquisition
Proposal shall not have been publicly withdrawn, and _provided_ that the
Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the Stockholders
Meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof), and (y)
within twelve (12) months after the date of such termination of this
Agreement the Company shall have consummated any Acquisition Proposal or
entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
and such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated (provided, that for
purposes of this clause (y) the references to "20%" in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%");

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_ ; or

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_
; then the Company shall:

 

(A) in the case of clause (i) above, promptly, but in no event later than
three (3) Business Days, after the date on which the Company consummates the
Acquisition Proposal referred to in subclause (i)(y) above, pay Parent the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds, less the
amount of any Parent Expenses that shall have actually been paid as provided
in  _Section 8.5(c)_ ;

(B) in the case of clause (ii) above, promptly but in no event later than
three (3) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay Parent the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds; and

(C) in the case of clause (iii) above, immediately prior to or substantially
concurrently with such termination, pay Parent the Termination Fee by wire
transfer of immediately available funds (it being understood that in no event
shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion).

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to  _Section 8.2(b)_ and either (x) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal
shall have been publicly disclosed or announced, and such Acquisition Proposal
shall not have been publicly withdrawn prior to the Stockholders Meeting or
(y) within twelve (12) months after the date of such termination of this
Agreement the Company Board (or authorized committee thereof) shall have
adopted (or resolved or authorized the Company to pursue) a (i) plan of
bankruptcy or reorganization or (ii) a plan of liquidation or dissolution,
then the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee(s), as the case may be
(by wire transfer of immediately available funds), the reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Parent and Merger Sub
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement including the fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, Financing Sources, experts and consultants in an aggregate amount not
to exceed $6,000,000 (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), which Parent Expenses shall
be payable: (A) promptly but in no event later than

 



69  three (3) Business Days after the date of any termination arising in the
circumstances described in clause (x) above, (B) substantially concurrently
with the filing of a plan of bankruptcy or reorganization in the case of
clause (y)(i) above and (C) substantially concurrently with the distribution
of the proceeds of any such liquidation or dissolution to the holders of
Company Common Stock in the case of clause (y)(ii) above;

 

(d) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.5_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the
parties would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay the
Termination Fee and/or Parent Expenses when due in accordance with
_Sections 8.5(b)_ and _8.5(c)_ , (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for
all of its costs and expenses incurred in connection with enforcement and
collection of such amounts and (ii) the Termination Fee and Parent Expenses
due shall accrue interest at a rate equal to the lower of the Prime Rate and
the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except for
(i) an order of specific performance as and only to the extent expressly
permitted by _Section 9.14_ and (ii) any willful and material breach by the
Company of this Agreement, the parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree
that:

(i) Parents receipt of the Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses from the
Company pursuant to  _Section 8.5(b)_ and _Section 8.5(c)_ (together with any
reimbursements due or interest thereon in accordance with _Section 8.5(d)_ ),
respectively, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub
and their respective affiliates against the Company, its Subsidiaries and any
of their respective former, current, or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, managers, members, affiliates or
agents (the " _Company Obligors_ ") for any loss suffered with respect to
this Agreement, the Transactions, the termination of this Agreement, the
failure of the First Merger to be consummated or any breach of this Agreement
by the Company.

 

(ii) In light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with
respect to the foregoing, upon any termination of this Agreement, (A) the
payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.5(b)_ , which
constitutes a reasonable estimate of the monetary damages that will be
suffered by Parent and Merger Sub by reason of breach or termination of this
Agreement shall be in full and complete satisfaction of any and all monetary
damages of Parent and Merger Sub arising out of or related to this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including, any breach by the
Company that is not a willful and material breach), the termination of this
Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any
such breach, termination or failure against the Company Obligors and (B)
after being paid such amounts in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
(x) none of the Company Obligors shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any claims or actions under applicable Law
arising out of any such breach, termination or failure and (y) in no event
will Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to seek to recover or obtain against any
of the Company Obligors any other damages, any recovery or judgment in excess
of the Termination Fee, or any other remedy based on a claim in Law or in
equity with respect thereto, including consequential, special, indirect or 

 



70  punitive damages for, or with respect to, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (including, any breach by the Company), the
termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any claims or actions under applicable Law
arising out of any such breach, termination or failure.

 

(f) If the Company is required to make a payment to Parent pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ , then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, unless Parent shall have received, and notified the Company in
writing of its receipt and directing that payment be made otherwise than into
escrow as provided below, a tax opinion of counsel or a ruling from the IRS to
the effect that Parents receipt of such payment will be treated as
qualifying income with respect to Parent for purposes of Section 856(c)(2) and
856(c)(3) of the Code or shall be excluded from income for such purposes (a "
_Positive Tax Opinion or Ruling_ "), the aggregate amount of the payment to
be paid to Parent pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be placed into escrow
as directed by Parent and the amounts payable to Parent shall be limited to
the maximum amount (" _Allowed Fee_ ") that can be paid without causing
Parents receipt of its pro rata share of such funds to cause Parent to fail
to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code,
determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute qualifying
income for such purposes, as determined by independent accountants to Parent.
In the event that any payment to be made pursuant to this _Article VIII_
exceeds the Allowed Fee, then such excess amount (the " _Escrowed Fee_ ")
shall be retained by the escrow agent in a separate interest-bearing,
segregated account for the account of the Company. Parent shall pay all costs
associated with obtaining any tax opinion of counsel or ruling from the IRS
described above. The Escrowed Fee shall be fully disbursed (and therefore any
unpaid portion of the payment pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be paid to
Parent) upon receipt of a Positive Tax Opinion or Ruling. To the extent not
previously paid, upon any determination by independent accountants to Parent
that any additional amount of the Escrowed Fee may be disbursed to Parent
without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2)
and 856(c)(3) of the Code, determined as if the payment of such amount did not
constitute qualifying income for such purposes, the determination of such
independent accountants shall be provided to the escrow agent and such
additional amount shall be disbursed. At the end of the second calendar year
beginning after the date on which the Escrowed Fee was first deposited with
the escrow agent (or earlier if directed by Parent), any remainder of the
Escrowed Fee (together with interest thereon) then being held by the escrow
agent shall be disbursed to the Company and, in the event that the payment
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ has not by then been paid in full, such unpaid
portion shall be deemed forgiven. Parent shall bear any and all expenses
associated with the escrow of the Escrowed Fee. Parent is hereby granted the
power of attorney on behalf of the Company to execute, acknowledge, swear to
and deliver all such documents required in connection with the foregoing
escrow account, such power to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest.

ARTICLE IX

Section 9.7 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference is to an Article or
Section of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation," unless the context expressly provides otherwise. As used in this
Agreement, the term "affiliates" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule
12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The table of contents and headings set forth in
this Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes only and shall not
affect or be deemed to affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or any term or provision hereof. The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement, except to the extent otherwise specified. References in this
Agreement to any item, document or information having been "delivered," "made
available" or any variation thereof means an item or document has been
delivered or made available to the applicable recipient party by posting such
item, document and information to, in the case of the Company, the "Project
Apple  Target - DD" data room on watchdox.com, or in the case of Parent, the
"Project Apple  Reverse Due Diligence" data room on watchdox.com, at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the execution of this Agreement and not
removed after it was posted. Any pronoun shall include the corresponding
masculine, feminine and neuter forms, and the definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such
terms. All terms defined in this Agreement have the defined meanings when used
in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto,
unless otherwise defined therein. When reference is made herein to a Person,
such reference shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries
of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires.
All references herein to the Subsidiaries of a Person shall be deemed to
include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise
indicated or the context otherwise requires. The Parties agree that they
have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

 



86 Section 9.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed manually or by
facsimile by the Parties, in any number of counterparts, each of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when a
counterpart hereof shall have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered
to the other Parties (including by means of electronic delivery), it being
understood that the Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Signatures to
this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in
"portable document format" (".pdf"), or by any other electronic means
intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a
document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document
bearing the original signature.

 

Section 9.9 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent
Disclosure Letter and the other documents and instruments referred to herein
or delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof and supersede all other prior agreements (except that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be amended so that until the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ hereof, Parent and Merger
Sub shall be permitted to take the actions contemplated by this Agreement) and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties or any of them with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

(b) Except as provided in  _Section 6.4_ , neither this Agreement (including
the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter and the other
documents and instruments referred to herein) nor the Confidentiality
Agreement are intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties and,
only with respect to _Section 9.1(a)_ , this _Section 9.9(b),_ _Section
9.11(a)_ and _(c)_ , _Section 9.12_ , _Section 9.13_ and _Section 9.15_ , the
Financing Sources, any rights or remedies hereunder.

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy in any jurisdiction, such term or other provision shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability and, unless the effect of such invalidity or
unenforceability would prevent the Parties from realizing the major portion of
the economic benefits of the Transactions that they currently anticipate
obtaining therefrom, shall not render invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement or affect the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible and the relevant provision may be given effect to the
fullest extent possible consistent with applicable Law.

 



87 Section 9.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of actions (whether at Law, in
equity, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of, or are
related to, this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Maryland applicable to agreements entered into and
performed entirely therein by residents thereof, without giving effect to
conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of Maryland or any other
jurisdiction that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Maryland).

(b) All Legal Proceedings and proceedings arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in the Circuit Court for
Baltimore City (Maryland) (the " _Maryland Court_ "). Each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to request and/or consent to the
assignment of any such proceeding to the Maryland Courts Business and
Technology Case Management Program. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (a) consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Maryland Court for the purpose of any Legal Proceeding brought by any Party
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any ancillary agreement, (b)
agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in the Maryland
Court, (c) agrees that any claim with respect to any such action
or proceeding shall be heard and determined in the Maryland Court, (d)
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to venue of any such action or
proceeding in the Maryland Court, and (e) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action or proceeding in the Maryland Court. Each of the Parties agrees
that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive,
subject to any rights of appeal, and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Nothing in this
Agreement shall, however, limit or affect the rights of any Party to pursue
appeals from any judgments or orders of the Maryland Court as provided by Law.
Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided
for notices in _Section 9.4_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right
of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in preceding clause (b) to the contrary, and
without limiting anything set forth in _Section 9.15_, each of the Parties
agrees that it will not bring or support any suit, action or other proceeding
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any
Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Transactions and
any related financing), or the performance thereof, in any forum other than
any New York State court or federal court sitting in the County of New York
and the Borough of Manhattan (and appellate courts thereof). The parties
hereto further agree that all of the provisions of _Section 9.12_ relating to
waiver of jury trial shall apply to any suit, action or other proceeding
referenced in this _Section 9.11(c)_.

Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT 

 



88  AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE MERGERS
AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES
AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B)
IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 9.12_.

 

Section 9.13 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
any of the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, except that (a) Merger Sub (and
after the Closing, the Second Merger Surviving Entity) may assign, in its
sole discretion and without the consent of any other Party, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to Parent or one or more
controlled affiliates of Parent and (b) Parent and Merger Sub may assign, in
their sole discretion and without the consent of any other Party, any or all
of their rights, interests and obligations hereunder to any of their Financing
Sources from time to time as collateral security. Any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentences, but without relieving any Party of any obligation
hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

Section 9.14 _Enforcement; Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and
the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached.

(c) The Parties right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to the grant of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches of
this Agreement by any other Party (including any objection on the basis that
there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance
is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity), and each Party
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of such Party under this Agreement all in accordance with the
terms of this _Section 9.14_. In the event any Party seeks an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, such Party shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with such order or
injunction all in accordance with the terms of this _Section 9.14_.

 



89 Section 9.15 _No Recourse_. Without limiting any other provision in this
Agreement (including the rights of the Financing Sources set forth in
_Section 9.9(b)_ ), this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, may only be made against the Parties. No Person who is not a Party,
including any current, former or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, affiliate or assignee
of, and any financial advisor, Financing Source or lender to any Party, or any
current, former or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, manager, stockholder, affiliate or assignee of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Nonparty Affiliates_ ") shall have any liability for
any obligations or liabilities of the parties hereto or for any claim (whether
in tort, contract or otherwise), based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
this Agreement or the Transactions or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith and, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law (other than as set forth in this Agreement and the other
transaction documents), each Party hereby waives and releases all such
liabilities, claims, causes of action and obligations against any such
Nonparty Affiliates of another Party. In no event shall the Company or any of
its affiliates, and the Company agrees not to, and to cause its affiliates
not to, (A) seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach
of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any
Financing Source or (B) seek to enforce the commitments against, make any
claims for breach of the Debt Financing commitments against, or seek to
recover monetary damages from, or otherwise sue, the Financing Sources for any
reason, including in connection with the Debt Financing commitments or the
obligations of the Financing Sources thereunder. Nothing in this _Section
9.15_ shall in any way limit or qualify the obligations and liabilities of the
parties to the Debt Financing commitments to each other or in connection
therewith.
