9 _Payment Mechanics for Shares_. 

---|---|--- 

(a) Pursuant to an exchange agent agreement between Parent and the
Exchange Agent (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ "), as of the
Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, on the same

(the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares (other
than Restricted Shares), cash necessary to pay the Initial Merger
Consideration to such holders of Shares to be paid in connection with the
Merger (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ,"
it being understood that any and all interest earned on funds deposited
therein pending payment shall be turned over to Parent). The Exchange Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make the payments provided for
in this Section 1.10 and the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.

(b) Parent will cause the Exchange Agent, within three Business Days
after the Closing Date, to deliver to each holder of record of a Certificate
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares
(other than Restricted Shares) at the address set forth opposite such holders
name on _Schedule 1.10(b)_ (as updated from time to time in writing by the
Company) a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting a
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for its respective portion of the
Merger Consideration in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (a " _Letter
of Transmittal_ "). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent together with the submission of a duly completed and validly
executed Letter of Transmittal and a properly completed and executed IRS Form
W-9 to the Exchange Agent, the holder of the Shares to which such Letter of
Transmittal relates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash
(without interest), representing such holders respective portion of the
Merger Consideration calculated in accordance with, and payable when and as
provided in, this Agreement, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld
with respect to such payments. Following the Effective Time and pending a
Stockholders submission of a Letter of Transmittal, each such holder will be
deemed, for all purposes, to hold an irrevocable right to receive that amount
of consideration equal to his, her or its respective portion of the Merger
Consideration into which such holders Shares shall have been so converted in
accordance with this Agreement.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may provide to
certain holders of Shares the Letter of Transmittal and other documentation
described above prior to the Effective Time, and any such holder that
surrenders a Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such Letter of
Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required
by the Exchange Agent, at or prior to Closing shall be entitled to receive,
and the Exchange Agent shall pay promptly after the Effective Time, cash
(without interest), representing such holders respective portion of the
Merger Consideration calculated in accordance with, and payable when and as
provided in, this Agreement, less applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payments.

 



10 (d) Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver, no later than
five Business Days after submission of a properly completed and duly executed
Letter of Transmittal by a Stockholder, cash (without interest), representing
such holders respective portion of the Initial Merger Consideration
calculated and payable in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(e) At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by a
holder of Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent and any such holder who has not returned a Letter of Transmittal in
accordance with this Section 1.10 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of such holders portion of the Initial Merger
Consideration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
none of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Representatives or any other party
hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares two years after the
Effective Time (or, in either case, such earlier date immediately prior to
such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Government) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

---|---|---

Standard Time, on the Closing Date, the excess of the current assets of the
Company (excluding any Cash and deferred Tax assets of the Company) over the
current liabilities of the Company (excluding any deferred Tax liabilities of
the Company and including any long-term deferred revenues), in each case as
reflected on the balance sheet of the Company as of such date. " _Cash_ "
means all cash on hand per the books of the Company immediately prior to the
Closing. 

(b) _Pre-Closing Estimates_. At least two Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company or the Representative shall deliver to Parent a
statement setting forth the calculation of an estimate as of the Closing Date

Capital_ "), (ii) the Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ "), (iii)
the Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_ "), and (iv) the Company Transaction
Expenses (such statement being, the " _Good Faith Statement_ "). The Good
Faith Statement shall be prepared by the Company in good faith, in a
reasonable manner and in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, and shall
have been approved by the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer. Parent shall have reasonable access to copies of the
working papers of the Company prepared or used in connection with the
Companys preparation of the Good Faith Statement. Parent shall have an
opportunity to review with representatives of the Company and object to all or
any part of the Good Faith Statement,

 



11  such review to be reasonably prompt and any objection to be reasonable and
made in good faith. If the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is less than
negative two million dollars ($(2,000,000)) (the " _Target Net Working
Capital_ "), then the Initial Merger Consideration payable at the Closing
pursuant to Sections 1.4 and 1.9(b) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
amount by which the Target Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Closing
Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital Shortfall_ "). The
Initial Merger Consideration payable at the Closing pursuant to Sections 1.4
and 1.9(b) shall also be reduced by an amount equal to the Estimated
Indebtedness, if any. The Initial Merger Consideration payable at the Closing
pursuant to Sections 1.4 and 1.9(b) shall also be increased by an amount equal
to the Estimated Cash, if any.

 

(c) _Delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement
of Indebtedness_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing
Date, and in any event within 90 calendar days thereafter, Parent shall
deliver to the Representative, (i) a balance sheet of the Company as of 11:59
p.m., Pacific Standard Time, on the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance
Sheet_ "), (ii) a calculation of Net Working Capital of the Company prepared
by Parent as of 11:59 p.m., Pacific Standard Time, on the Closing
Date, determined using the Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Closing Net Working
Capital_ "), (iii) a statement reflecting the Indebtedness of the Company
immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Closing Statement of Indebtedness_
") and (iv) a statement reflecting the Cash of the Company immediately prior
to the Closing (the " _Closing Statement of Cash_ "). The total amount of
Indebtedness on the Closing Statement of Indebtedness shall be the " _Closing
Indebtedness_." The total amount of Cash on the Closing Statement of Cash
shall be the " _Closing Cash_." For purposes of preparing the Closing Balance
Sheet and the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Company to, take, within a reasonable period of time
following the Closing, a physical count of the inventory of the Surviving
Company. Designees of the Representative may observe the taking of such
physical count. The Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement of Cash shall
be prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied by the Company in a manner consistent with
the accounting principles applied in the preparation of the Annual Financial
Statements (as hereinafter defined) of the Company.

(d) _Audit Rights; Agreement upon the Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness and Closing Cash_. Upon delivery of the Closing
Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement of Indebtedness and the Closing Statement
of Cash, Parent shall provide the Representative and its accountants
reasonable access to the accountants and accounting records of the Company and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Representative
with reasonable access to any and all working papers prepared by the Company
or Parent related to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing
Statement of Indebtedness and the Closing Statement of Cash, and the
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing
Cash. If the Representative disagrees with the calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital or Closing Cash as not being in accordance with GAAP
consistent with the Audited Financial Statements, or, in any case, as having
computational errors, the

 



12 Representative must notify Parent of such disagreement in writing, setting
forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement, within 30
days after its receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of
Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Statement of Indebtedness and the
calculation of Closing Indebtedness or the Closing Statement of Cash and the
calculation of Cash, as the case may be. In the event that the Representative
does not provide such a notice of disagreement within such 30 day period, the
Representative shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Balance Sheet and
the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital set forth therein and/or the
Closing Statement of Indebtedness and the calculation of Closing Indebtedness
set forth therein and/or the Closing Statement of Cash and the calculation of
Closing Cash set forth therein, each as delivered by Parent, which, in any or
all cases, if not objected to within the relevant 30 day period, shall then be
final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any
such notice of disagreement is timely provided, Parent and the Representative
shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of 30 days (or such
longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with
respect to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and/or the
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital or the Closing Statement of
Indebtedness and/or calculation of Closing Indebtedness or the Closing
Statement of Cash and/or calculation of Closing Cash, as the case may be. If,
at the end of such period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements, then
Parent and the Representative shall mutually select an independent accounting
firm of recognized national standing (the " _Auditor_ ") to act as a referee
to resolve any remaining disagreements. The Auditor shall determine as
promptly as practicable, but in any event within 30 calendar days after the
date on which such dispute is referred to the Auditor, based solely on the
terms of this Agreement, any remaining disputes. Each of Parent and the
Representative (or their respective designees) shall be permitted to submit a
proposed Closing Balance Sheet, Closing Statement of Indebtedness or
Closing Statement of Cash, as the case may be and applicable supporting
documentation and to make a presentation to the Auditor in connection with the
resolution of any such disagreements, and, without the mutual agreement of
Parent and the Representative, the Auditor shall not rely on or consider any
other documents, materials, presentations or evidence (other than the plain
language of the Agreement) in making its determination. To the extent that a
value has been assigned to any disagreement that remains in dispute, the
Auditor shall not assign a value to such objection that is greater than the
greatest value for such objection claimed by either Party or less than the
smallest value for such objection claimed by either Party. It is the intent
of the Parties that the process set forth in this Section 1.11(d) and the
activities of the Auditor in connection herewith are not (and should not be
considered to be or treated as) an arbitration proceeding or similar arbitral
process and that no formal arbitration rules should be followed (including,
in particular, but without limitation, rules with respect to procedures and
discovery). The fees and expenses of the Auditor incurred in connection with
its review and resolution of any disputes shall be allocated between Parent,
on one hand, and the Representative, on the other, by the Auditor in
proportion to the extent either of such Parties did not prevail in the
aggregate on items in dispute on their respective Closing Balance Sheets,
Closing Statements of Indebtedness or Closing Statements of Cash, as the case
may be; _provided,_ that such fees and expenses shall not include, so long as
a Party complies with the procedures of this Section, the other Partys
outside counsel, accounting or other fees. The determination of the Auditor
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The amounts of the
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Cash as
finally determined in accordance with the terms of this Section 1.11 shall be

 



13  referred to as the " _Final Closing Net Working Capital_ ," " _Final Closing
Indebtedness_ " and " _Final Closing Cash_ ," respectively. The date on
which the Final Closing Net Working Capital, Final Closing Indebtedness and
Final Closing Cash are all finally determined in accordance with this Section
1.11(d) (or the latest date on which any of such calculation is finally
determined) is hereinafter referred to as, the " _Determination Date."_

 

(e) _Definitions_. The following terms shall have the following
meanings:

 

(i) " _Cash Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or negative,
means (A) the Final Closing Cash, _minus_ (B) the Estimated Cash.

(ii) " _Final Net Working Capital Excess_ " means, expressed as a
positive number, (I) if the Final Closing Net Working Capital is greater than
the Target Net Working Capital and the Estimated Net Working Capital (which is
less than the Target Net Working Capital), the amount of any Estimated Net
Working Capital Shortfall previously deducted from the Initial Merger
Consideration or (II) if the Final Net Working Capital is less than the
Target Net Working Capital but greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital,
then the amount by which the Final Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated
Net Working Capital.

 

(iii) " _Final Net Working Capital Shortfall_ " means, expressed as a
negative number, if the Final Closing Net Working Capital is less than the
Target Net Working Capital and less than the Estimated Net Working Capital,
the amount by which the Target Net Working Capital exceeds the Final Closing
Net Working Capital less any Estimated Net Working Capital Shortfall
previously deducted from the Initial Merger Consideration.

 

(iv) " _Indebtedness Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or
negative, means (A) the Final Closing Indebtedness, _minus_ (B) the Estimated
Indebtedness, each expressed as a negative number.

 

(v) " _Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or
negative, means the Final Net Working Capital Excess or Final Net Working
Capital Shortfall, as applicable.

For purposes of convenience only, the Parties agree that upon the final
determination of the Indebtedness Adjustment Amount, the Cash Adjustment
Amount and the Working Capital Adjustment Amount, such amounts shall be
aggregated for the purpose of paying the Adjustment Amount (as defined below)
to Parent or the Representative, as the case may be. The sum of the
Indebtedness Adjustment Amount, Cash Adjustment Amount and the Working
Capital Adjustment Amount shall be the " _Adjustment Amount_ ". For example,
if the Indebtedness Adjustment Amount equals negative $1,000,000 (i.e., such
amount

 



14  is owed to Parent), the Cash Adjustment Amount equals negative $200,000
(i.e., such amount is owed to Parent) and the Working Capital Adjustment
Amount equals positive $100,000 (i.e., such amount is owed to the
Stockholders), each as finally determined, then the Adjustment Amount would be
negative $1,100,000 and such amount would be owed to Parent in accordance with
the terms of this Section 1.11.

 

(f) _Positive Adjustment Payment_. If the Adjustment Amount is a
positive number, then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in any
event within three Business Days of the Determination Date, Parent shall
deposit (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) the
Adjustment Amount (other than the portion of the Adjustment Amount allocable
to the Unvested Restricted Shares, which shall be payable to the holders of
the Unvested Restricted Shares when such Unvested Restricted Shares vest
according to the vesting schedule applicable to such Shares as of the
Effective Time) in such bank account(s) as may be designated by the
Representative, for distribution to the Stockholders (other than any
Stockholder who holds Dissenting Shares or Restricted Shares),
without interest.

(g) _Negative Adjustment Payment_. If the Adjustment Amount is a
negative number, then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in any
event within five Business Days of the Determination Date, the Parties shall
cause the Escrow Agent to pay (by wire transfer of immediately available
funds) to Parent out of the Escrow Amount an amount equal to the lesser of (A)
the Adjustment Amount, together with any interest earned on that portion of
the Escrow Amount equal to the Adjustment Amount or (B) the full amount of
the Escrow Amount, together with any interest earned thereon.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Indebtedness_ " shall mean, without
duplication (i) all indebtedness for borrowed money, (ii) that portion of
obligations with respect to capital leases that is properly classified as a
liability on a balance sheet in conformity with GAAP (as hereinafter
defined); (iii) notes payable and drafts accepted representing extensions of
credit whether or not representing obligations for borrowed money (for the
avoidance of doubt, excluding any trade accounts payable and checks payable
to the Company, which have been endorsed by the Company for collection in the
ordinary course of business); (iv) guaranties securing indebtedness for
borrowed money; (v) all amounts drawn under outstanding letters of credit;
(vi) all deferred compensation obligations, including (A) all payment
obligations under the Companys non-qualified deferred compensation plans and
(B) any underfunded pension, termination indemnity, seniority premium, or
post-retirement liabilities of the Company as required to be measured under
SFAS 87 or SFAS 106 at the transaction date; (vii) all costs and obligations
incurred in connection with a change of control of the Company (excluding the
Estimated Company Transaction Expenses); (viii) dividends payable on any
Shares, regardless of whether or not accrued; and (ix) liability for any Taxes
attributable to any Tax period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the
Closing Date that would be required in accordance with GAAP to be reflected as
liabilities on the Companys balance sheet, other than current Taxes, and (x)
all interest, any premiums payable or any other costs or charges (including
any prepayment penalties) on any instruments or obligations described in
clauses (i) through (ix) hereof, all as the same may be payable upon the
complete and final payoff thereof, regardless of whether such payoff occurs
prior to, simultaneous with or following the Closing.

 



15 _Escrow and Representative Expense Account_. 

---|---|--- 
 

(a) _Escrow Account_. On the Closing Date, Parent shall pay (or
cause to be paid), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Escrow
Amount to the Escrow Agent, to be held in escrow to satisfy, at least in part,
any claims by (i) Parent for satisfaction of any post-closing adjustment
pursuant to Section 1.11; (ii) any Parent Indemnified Person for any
indemnification claim of any Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to Section
8.2; or (iii) any Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Escrow Account_
"). The Escrow Agent shall hold and invest the Escrow Amount in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and all interest and earnings earned
from the investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Amount shall be added to
the Escrow Account. The Parties agree for all Tax purposes that: (i) the right
of the Stockholders to the Escrow Amount shall be treated as deferred purchase
price eligible for installment sale treatment under Section 453 of the Code
and any corresponding provisions of state, local or non-U.S. law, as
appropriate; (ii) interest may be imputed on such amount, as required by
Section 483 or 1274 of the Code; (iii) Parent shall be treated as the owner
of the Escrow Amount and all interest and earnings earned from the investment
and reinvestment of the Escrow Amount, or portion thereof, shall be allocable
to Parent for Tax purposes pursuant to Section 468B(g) of the Code and
Proposed Treasury Regulations section 1.468B-8; and (iv) in no event shall the
total amount of the Escrow Amount, plus interest and earnings thereon, paid to
the Stockholders under this Agreement exceed an amount designated by the
Parties prior to Closing.

(b)   _The Representative_. Upon any claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.2, the Representative shall serve as the designated
representative of the Stockholders for purposes of receiving notices,
contesting claims, and authorizing payments for such claims. If the
Stockholders become obligated (whether through mutual agreement between Parent
and the Representative, as a result of a final non-appealable judicial
determination or otherwise finally determined in accordance with the terms
hereof or the terms of the Escrow Agreement) to provide an adjustment,
indemnification or another payment pursuant to or in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, Parent and the Representative shall, if necessary for the
release of funds from the Escrow Account, promptly execute joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse the appropriate amount from the
Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement.

(c) _Representative Expense Account_. At Closing, Parent shall withhold
the Representative Expense Amount from the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to Section 1.4 and shall pay the Representative Expense
Amount to an account, separate from the Escrow Account, designated by
the Representative. The Representative Expense Amount shall be held, used and
disbursed by or at the direction of the Representative for the purpose of
paying fees and satisfying expenses of the Representative incurred in
connection with the discharge of its duties under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, including the costs and expenses incurred by the
Representative in defending against any claim or liability in performing his
duties on behalf of the Stockholders. The Representative shall have the right
to recover all costs and expenses incurred hereunder from the Representative
Expense Amount as such costs and expenses arise. If any of the Representative
Expense Amount remains after the

 



16  Representative has discharged its duties under this Agreement, the
Representative shall pay to each Stockholder an amount equal to such
Stockholders Percentage of such excess. At all times, Stockholders shall be
treated for all Tax purposes as the owners of the Representative Expense
Amount and all interest and earnings thereon, if any.

(d) _Remaining Balance in Escrow Account_. On the first anniversary
of the Closing Date, Parent and the Representative shall cause the Escrow
Agent (in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement) to pay (by wire
transfer of immediately available funds) to such account(s) designated in the
Escrow Agreement, any amounts in the Escrow Account (which have not then
been claimed by Parent to be owed to a Parent Indemnified Person) in excess
of the amount of (i) eight million dollars ($8,000,000) (the " _Remaining
Escrow Amount_ ") plus (ii) any interest earned on the Remaining Escrow
Amount, for distribution to the Stockholders (except that any amount then
comprising Unvested Consideration or forfeited Unvested Consideration and the
interest earned thereon shall be paid to Parent subject to the terms and
conditions of Section 1.7(b) hereof) in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. Upon the expiration of the 18-month period following the
Closing Date, Parent and the Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent (in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement) to pay (by wire transfer
of immediately available funds) to such account(s) designated in the Escrow
Agreement, any remaining amounts in the Escrow Account (which have not then
been claimed by Parent to be owed to a Parent Indemnified Person), together
with any interest earned on any such amount, for distribution to the
Stockholders (except that any amount then comprising Unvested Consideration or
forfeited Unvested Consideration and the interest earned thereon shall be
paid to Parent subject to the terms and conditions of Section 1.7(b) hereof)
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(e) _Merger Consideration Adjustments_. Except for any interest
amount(s) paid thereon, any amounts distributed to Parent pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 1.12 shall be deemed to be and treated for all
purposes as adjustments to the Merger Consideration, except as otherwise
provided in Section 1.12(c).

 



     | 1.13 |

_Company Transaction Expenses_. 

---|---|--- 

(a) Estimated Company Transaction Expenses. At least two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Representative shall provide to Parent an
estimate (which estimate shall include such reserves as the Representative
determines in good faith to be appropriate for any expenses that are not then
known or determinable) on _Schedule 1.13(a)_ of the Company Transaction
Expenses (segregated by payee, to the extent reasonably known or
anticipated), that have been incurred (but not yet paid) prior to Closing and
that may be incurred at or after the Closing (" _Estimated Company Transaction
Expenses_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Transaction Expenses"
means all expenses incurred or to be incurred by the Company, the Stockholders
and the Representative on behalf of the Company, the Stockholders or the
Representative in connection with the preparation, negotiation and execution
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and/or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, the Merger),
including, but not limited to,

 



17  all accounting, legal, investment banking and commercial banking fees and
expenses related thereto. Set forth on _Schedule 1.13(a)_ is a good faith
estimate as of the date of this Agreement of all Company Transaction
Expenses.

(b) _Payment of Estimated Company Transaction Expenses_. On the
Closing Date, Parent shall pay (by wire transfer of immediately available
funds): (i) to Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, the amount indicated in the
Estimated Company Transaction Expenses as payable to Wilson Sonsini Goodrich
and Rosati; (ii) to AGC Partners the amount indicated in the Estimated Company
Transaction Expenses as payable to AGC Partners; and (iii) to the
Representative or its designee, an aggregate amount of cash equal to the
aggregate amount of Estimated Company Transaction Expenses, _less_ any amounts
paid under clauses (i) through (ii) above, which the Representative shall use
to promptly pay (and in any event within five Business Days) the Estimated
Company Transaction Expenses, other than, or in addition to, those referenced
in clauses (i) through (ii) above. After payment of the Company Transaction
Expenses has been completed, the Representative shall distribute to the
Stockholders (other than any Stockholder who holds Dissenting Shares), any
remaining cash less any amount of such remaining cash that would be payable
with respect to Dissenting Shares if such Shares had not been Dissenting
Shares with such amount being paid to Parent.

 

1.14 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company_. The
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Company shall be as set forth in _Exhibits E and F_ , respectively (together,

---|---|--- 
 

(a) The directors and officers set forth on _Schedule 1.15(a)_  shall
be the directors and officers of the Surviving Company, effective as of the
Effective Time, until their successors shall have been duly elected and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 

(b) The Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to) honor its obligations under the Surviving Company
Organizational Documents with respect to the directors and officers set forth
on _Schedule 1.15(b)_ (each, a " _Company Indemnified Person_ " and
collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Persons_ ").

(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to) cause the Surviving Company
Organizational Documents to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses, covering acts
and omissions of the Company Indemnified Persons, in each case in their
capacities as officers or directors of the Company, occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, which provisions are at least as favorable as the
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions contained
in the Company Organizational Documents as of the date hereof, and, during
such six-year period, except as required by applicable Law, such provisions

 



18  shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that
adversely affects the rights of the Company Indemnified Persons thereunder.
Prior to the Closing, the Company shall have purchased a six-year tail policy
or policies (the " _Tail Policy_ ") for its officers and directors liability
insurance on terms consistent with those in effect for the Company immediately
prior to the date hereof. Parent shall pay 50% of the cost of such Tail
Policy; provided, however, that in no event shall Parents portion of such
cost exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000). Following the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to maintain such policy in full
force and effect throughout the term of such policy (with no obligation to
extend the policy beyond its six-year term) and to continue to honor its
obligations thereunder. Except as expressly provided in Section 1.15(b)
and (c), for each present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary
and agent of the Company, the Tail Policy, together with any other policy of
directors and officers liability insurance held by the Company and in effect
prior to the Effective Time under which coverage is available, shall be the
sole source of indemnification by the Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Company.



     | 1.16 |

_Stockholders  Representative; Actions_. 

---|---|--- 
 

(a) Desmond P. Wilson III has been appointed as the true and
lawful attorney-in-fact of the Stockholders for all matters in connection
with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (the " _Representative_ ")
pursuant to and by virtue of the requisite approval of this Agreement by the
holders of the Shares. The Representative will act on behalf of the
Stockholders with respect to all matters requiring action by the Stockholders
under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The Representative hereby
accepts such appointment. In the event of the incapacity or resignation or
any vacancy of the Representative, a successor representative will be
appointed by a majority of the Shares held by the Stockholders.

 

(b) The Representative shall take all actions required to be taken
by the Stockholders under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and may take
any action contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. By giving
notice to the Representative in the manner provided by Section 10.1, Parent
shall be deemed to have given notice to all Stockholders. Any action taken by
the Representative may be considered by Parent to be the action of the
Stockholder(s) for whom such action was taken for all purposes of this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. 

(c) In the event that Parent gives notice to the Representative of a
claim for which indemnification may be sought, the Representative shall have
the authority to determine, in his or her sole judgment, whether to retain
counsel (and to select that counsel) to protect the Stockholders interests,
subject to Section 8.5, whether to consent to indemnification and to make all
other decisions required to be made by the Stockholders pursuant to this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, including without limitation whether to
consent or withhold his or her consent to any settlement or compromise of a
claim.

 

(d) The Representative shall not be liable to any Stockholder for
any act or omission taken pursuant to or in conjunction with this Agreement,
except for his or her own gross negligence. The Stockholders shall indemnify
and hold the Representative, and each

 



19  successor thereof, harmless from any and all liability, expenses or losses
(including, without limitation, counsel fees) which may arise out of any
action taken or omitted by him or her as Representative in accordance with
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, as the same may be amended, modified
or supplemented, except such liability and expense as may result from the
gross negligence of the Representative and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Representatives duties
hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel
retained by the Representative (" _Representative Expenses_ ").
The Representative shall have the right to recover Representative Expenses,
or to set aside a reserve fund for Representative Expenses reasonably likely
to be incurred from any positive Adjustment Amount or any amount to be
distributed to the Stockholders from the Escrow Account; provided, however,
that while this Section 1.16(d) allows the Representative to be paid from any
Adjustment Amount and any amount to be distributed to the Stockholders from
the Escrow Account, this does not relieve the Stockholders from their
obligation to promptly pay such Representative Expenses, nor does it prevent
the Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or
otherwise. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Representative,
including an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to
Sections 10.10 and 10.12, shall constitute a decision of the Stockholders and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Stockholders; and the
Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Representative as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholders. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby
relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Representative.

(e) The Representative agrees that within a commercially reasonable
time after receipt of notice of a claim, he or she shall give each Stockholder
notice of the same and shall from time to time keep the Stockholders apprised
as to developments with respect to such claim. Such notices shall be sent to
the Stockholders at their respective addresses as may be communicated to the
Representative in writing by the Stockholders.

of the U.S. Department of Commerce (" _BIS_ "), sanctions and embargo
executive orders and regulations administered by the Office of Foreign Assets
Control of the U.S. Treasury Department and the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations administered by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls of the
U.S. State Department, all as amended from time to time;

(e) in compliance with the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977, as amended, any applicable Law implementing the OECD
Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International
Business or other applicable anti-corruption conventions, and any other
applicable anti-corruption law;

 

(f) in compliance with any and all applicable import laws, orders
or regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, as amended from time to time,
and without notice of violation of and in compliance with any required import
permits, licenses, authorizations and general licenses granted under such
laws, regulations or orders, which permits, licenses and authorizations are
described in _Schedule 2.31(f)_;

 

(g) none of the products exported by the Company are those defined in
15 C.F.R. Section 740.17(b)(3)(iii), which covers encryption commodities and
software that provide or perform vulnerability analysis, network forensics or
computer forensics functions characterized by any of the following:

 



54 (i) automated network analysis, visualization or packet inspection for
profiling network flow, network user or client behavior, or network

that required authorization from BIS during the period prior to and
including January 13, 2010. All representations made in the 2010 VSD and all
representations made to any agent of BIS in connection with the 2010 VSD were
true and accurate to the Companys knowledge. The encryption functionality of
the Storm CTM was, as of May 4, 2010, identical in each and every respect to
the encryption functionality of the BreakingPoint Elite such that exports of
the Storm CTM and the Firestorm CTM utilizing license exception ENC were
covered by the review request filed for the BreakingPoint Elite on January
14, 2010, and were thus eligible for export under license ENC according to the
Export Administration Regulations in force at the time. The encryption
functionality of the Storm CTM and the Firestorm CTM has not changed in any
material respect since May 4, 2010. The encryption functionality of the
Firestorm CTM has not changed since the encryption review request for the

otherwise requires in response to a notice or consent request regarding this
Agreement, the payment of a consent fee or other consideration (including
increased rent payments), Parent shall be solely responsible for making all
such payments.

promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any applicable non-US
antitrust or competition law and to use their reasonable best efforts to take

the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any applicable non-US
antitrust or competition law as soon as practicable.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) in taking, upon Parents
direction, such actions or making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such
actions, consents, approvals or waivers; provided, however, that for the

case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) only if the Board

actions referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 5.8(b) unless the

conditions of the Acquisition Proposal would result in a transaction (i) that
if consummated, is materially more favorable to Stockholders from a financial
point of view than the Merger or, if applicable, any proposal by Parent to
amend the terms of this Agreement taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including the expected timing
and likelihood of consummation, taking into account any governmental and other

     | 7.6 |

_Taxes_. 

---|---|--- 

(a) The Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and
timely file or cause to be timely filed, at the Stockholders cost
and expense, all Income Tax Returns (including for purposes of this Section
7.6 Tax Returns for withholding Taxes measured by, or calculated with respect
to, any payments or distributions (other than wages)) of the Company for any
Tax year or period ending on or before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax
Period_ "). The Representative shall provide Parent with a copy of all Income
Tax Returns of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (" _Pre-Closing
Period Income Tax Returns_ ") no later than 30 days prior to the due date of
each such Pre-Closing Income Tax Return. Such Pre-Closing Period Income Tax
Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior Tax Returns,
except as required by Law. Parent shall be entitled to propose revisions to
any Pre-Closing Period Income Tax Return, so long as any proposed revisions
are provided to the Representative no later than ten days after the date on
which the Parent received a copy of such Pre-Closing Period Income Tax Return
from the Representative. The Representative shall consider Parents comments
in good faith.

 



77  All other Tax Returns of the Company for any Pre-Closing Period that are due
after the Closing Date shall be prepared and timely filed by Parent in a
manner consistent with prior Tax Returns of the Company, unless otherwise
required to avoid penalties, in which case Parent shall provide to the
Representative a draft of each such Tax Return that is not prepared in a
manner consistent with prior Tax Returns of the Company a reasonable
period prior to the due date of each such Tax, and Parent shall consider in
good faith the Representatives comments and proposed revisions to such Tax
Returns. All Taxes payable with respect to the Tax Returns to be filed
pursuant to this Section 7.6(a) shall be borne by the Stockholders and paid
to Parent from the Escrow Account to the extent thereof and then directly by
the Stockholders (but subject to Section 8.6(c)(ii)), no later than seven
Business Days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns to the extent
such Taxes are not reflected in the Final Closing Net Working Capital as a
current liability.

(b) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and timely file or
cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and the Surviving
Company for any Tax year or period beginning on or before and ending after
the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "). Such Tax Returns shall be prepared
in a manner consistent with prior Tax Returns of the Company, unless otherwise
required to avoid penalties. Parent shall provide to the Representative a
draft of each such Tax Return that is an Income Tax Return no later than 30
days prior to the due date of each such Tax Return, and shall provide a draft
of each such other Tax Return that is not prepared in a manner consistent
with prior Tax Returns of the Company a reasonable period prior to the due
date of each such Tax, and Parent shall consider in good faith the
Representatives comments and proposed revisions to such Tax Returns. The
Escrow Agent, to the extent of the Escrow Fund, and thereafter the
Stockholders (but subject to Section 8.6(c)(ii)) shall pay to Parent within
seven Business Days after the date on which Taxes are paid for any Straddle
Period, an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes for the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, except to the extent such Taxes
are reflected in the Final Closing Net Working Capital as a current liability.
For the purposes of this Section 7.6(b), in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax that
relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date shall (i)
in the case of any Taxes other than an Income Tax, be deemed to be the amount
of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on the Closing Date,
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period,
and (ii) in the case of any Income Tax or withholding tax, be deemed to be
equal to the amount that would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on
the Closing Date, provided, that exemptions, allowances or deductions that
are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions), other than with respect to property placed in service after the
Closing, shall be allocated between the period Pre-Closing Tax Period and
the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each
period. Any credits relating to a Straddle Period shall be taken into account
as though the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date, unless such
credit was reflected as a Tax Asset in the calculation of Final Closing Net
Working Capital. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
allocations described in this Section 7.6(b) shall be made in a manner
consistent with the prior practice of the Company, except for changes
required by Law or fact.

 



78 (c) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to,
amend any previously filed Tax Return of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Straddle Period without the prior written consent of the
Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the amount of Taxes reflected
on any such amended Tax Return nor the consent of the Representative to the
filing thereof shall be dispositive of the right of a Parent
Indemnified Person to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement.

(d)  Provided that the related Taxes (i) have been paid by the Company
for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) have been
included as a liability in Final Closing Net Working Capital, or (iii) have
resulted in a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, then any
refunds of such Taxes or credits for overpayment of such Taxes that are
actually received in cash, or actually reduce the cash Taxes required to be
paid, by Parent or any of its Affiliates shall be for the account of the
Stockholders, and Parent will, and will cause its Affiliates to, deliver and
pay over to the Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders, any such refund
or the amount of any such credit within ten (10) business days after receipt,
provided that such refunds or credits shall not be for the account of
Stockholders to the extent such amounts were included as an asset on the
Closing Balance Sheet. Parent will take all commercially reasonable actions
to obtain such refunds and credits, as requested in writing by the
Representative. All other refunds and credits shall be for the account of
Parent and its Affiliates.

 

(e) The Representative and Parent agree to furnish or cause to
be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practical, such
information (including reasonable access to books and records, Tax Returns and
Tax filings) and assistance as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any
Tax Return, the conduct of any Tax audit, and for the prosecution or defense
of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax matter. The
Representative and Parent shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of
any Tax audit or other Tax proceedings and each shall execute and deliver
such powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the
intent of this Section 7.6. Any Tax audit or other Tax proceeding shall be
deemed to be a Third-Person Claim subject to the procedures set forth in
Section 8.5 of this Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Parties agree that
all transactions occurring on the Closing Date shall be reported in a Pre-
Closing Period Tax Return to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulations
section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B). For the avoidance of doubt, any Tax
deductions arising on or before the Closing Date attributable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be permitted to be utilized
to offset income of the Company attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and
the portion of any Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date.

(g)  Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall terminate any
intercompany obligations, if any, within the meaning of Section 1502 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

8.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants_.
The representations and warranties of the Parties made herein shall survive
the Closing and continue in effect through and including the 18-month

applicable statutes of limitations with respect to the matters addressed
therein (including any extensions or tollings thereof). The covenants made by
the Parties herein shall survive in accordance with their respective terms,
and if no specific term is specified, in perpetuity. Any claims under this
Agreement with respect to a breach of a representation and warranty or

     | 8.2 |

_Indemnification of Parent_. 

---|---|--- 

(a) From and after the Closing, pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, the Side Agreements and the Letters of Transmittal and subject to
the limitations contained in this Article 8, Parent and its Affiliates
(including, from and after the Closing, the Surviving Company and the Company)
and the stockholders, directors, officers, employees, successors, assigns, and
agents of each of them in their capacities as such (the " _Parent Indemnified
Persons_ "), shall be indemnified and held harmless from and against, without
duplication, any and all claims, losses, Taxes, judgments, orders, damages,
liabilities, expenses or costs (" _Losses_ "), net of any amounts listed in
Section 8.6(g), plus reasonable attorneys fees and expenses accrued or
actually incurred in connection with Losses and/or enforcement of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other ancillary document and interest
on the amount of such Losses at the Prime Rate, as it appears in the Wall
Street Journal, from the date that such Losses were incurred until the day
immediately prior to the date of payment to the Indemnified Party, determined
based on a 360-day year (in all, " _Indemnified Losses_ "), incurred or to be
incurred by any of them resulting from or arising out of:

 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company
in this Agreement;

(ii) any nonfulfillment, nonperformance, nonobservance or other breach
or violation, or default in performance by the Company (in the case of the
Company, prior to or at the Closing) or the Representative of, any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other
ancillary document;

 



80 (iii) any Indebtedness of the Company immediately prior to the
Closing, but only to the extent not taken into account in determining the
Initial Merger Consideration;

 

(iv) any Company Transaction Expenses, but only to the extent not
taken into account in determining the Initial Merger Consideration;

(v)  any claims made by current or former holders of any equity or
debt of the Company (including, without limitation, the holders of any Common
Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or any options or warrants to purchase equity
or debt of the Company) of any kind or nature whatsoever, in such capacity as
an equity or debt holder or any other capacity, in each case whether absolute
or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known or unknown, and whether
arising under any agreement or understanding (other than those of the
Stockholders arising under this Agreement or any of the other agreements
executed and delivered by Parent in connection herewith) or otherwise at law
or equity (other than claims for which the facts or circumstances giving rise
to such claim first occur following the Effective Time);

 

(vi) any claims for appraisal or dissenters rights with respect to
any Shares under Delaware Law or any other applicable Law;

(vii)  the Companys Taxes or the Companys liability, if any (for
example, by reason of transferee liability or application of Treasury
Regulations section 1.1502-6) for Taxes of others or Indemnified Losses
payable with respect to Taxes claimed or assessed against the Company for any
Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date or as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby (to the extent such Taxes are
not reflected in the Final Closing Net Working Capital); or

 

(viii) the matters set forth on _Schedule 8.2(a)(viii)_ (the "
_Scheduled Indemnity Matters_ ").

 

(b) In consideration of the Parents agreement to pay the
Merger Consideration, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and other good and valuable consideration (the receipt and sufficiency
of which is hereby agreed to and acknowledged), by execution of the Side
Agreements or Letters of Transmittal, the Stockholders shall severally and
not jointly indemnify and hold harmless each of the Parent Indemnified Persons
from and against, and each Stockholder shall thereby waive any claim for
contribution or indemnity from any of the Parent Indemnified Persons with
respect to such Stockholders Percentage of, any Indemnified Losses accrued or
actually incurred by any of the Parent Indemnified Persons resulting from,
arising out of, Section 8.2(a)(i) through Section 8.2(a)(viii) or any act of
fraud committed by the Company or fraud by such Stockholder. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Percentage_ " means, with respect to each
Stockholder, the amount calculated as follows and expressed as a percentage:
the aggregate Merger Consideration which such Stockholder is entitled to
receive (including Merger Consideration payable to Stockholders pursuant to
Section 1.7) hereunder divided by the

 



81  aggregate Merger Consideration payable to all Stockholders hereunder
(including Merger Consideration payable to Stockholders pursuant to Section
1.7). Subject to Section 8.6, any amounts owed to Parent Indemnified Persons
for such Indemnified Losses shall first be paid out of the Escrow Account in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement and then, to the extent that such
Indemnified Losses exceed the then available balance in the Escrow Account or
indemnification for such Indemnified Losses is due after termination of the
Escrow Account, pursuant to this Section 8.2(b). Except for Indemnified Losses
resulting from, arising out of, or directly or indirectly connected to fraud
committed by the Company or such Stockholder, a Stockholders obligations
under this Section 8.2(b) shall not exceed the aggregate amount of Merger
Consideration actually received by such Stockholder.

 

(c) By execution of a Side Agreement or Letter of Transmittal,
each Stockholder shall severally and not jointly hold the Parent Indemnified
Persons harmless and indemnify each of them from and against, and each
Stockholder waives any claim for contribution or indemnity from any of the
Parent Indemnified Persons (including the Surviving Company and the Company)
with respect to, any and all Indemnified Losses incurred or to be incurred by
any of them resulting from or arising out of:

 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by such
Stockholder in such Side Agreement or Letter of Transmittal, it being agreed
and acknowledged that with respect this Section 8.2(c)(i) each Stockholder is
providing indemnity only with respect to breaches of representations and
warranties made by such Stockholder in such Side Agreement or Letter of
Transmittal and not those of any other Stockholder in any other Side Agreement
or Letter of Transmittal, and that each Stockholder shall be liable under this
Section 8.2(c)(i) only for the Indemnified Losses for which such Stockholder
is providing indemnity under this Section 8.2(c)(i), without being limited to
such Stockholders Percentage thereof and no other Stockholder shall be liable
for any such Indemnified Losses; or

(ii) any nonfulfillment, nonperformance, nonobservance or other
breach or violation, or default in performance, by such Stockholder of any
covenant or agreement of such Stockholder contained in such Side Agreement or
Letter of Transmittal, it being agreed and acknowledged that with respect to
this Section 8.2(c)(ii) each Stockholder is providing indemnity only with
respect to the nonfulfillment, nonperformance, nonobservance or other breach
or violation, or default in performance, of the covenants and agreements made
by such Stockholder in such Side Agreement or Letter of Transmittal and not
with respect to those of any other Stockholders in any other Side Agreement or
Letter of Transmittal, and that each Stockholder shall be liable under
this Section 8.2(c)(ii) only for the Indemnified Losses for which such
Stockholder is providing indemnity under this Section 8.2(c)(ii), without
being limited to such Stockholders Percentage thereof and no other
Stockholder shall be liable for any such Indemnified Losses.

(d) The Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover any
Indemnified Losses to which they are entitled hereunder from the Escrow
Account or pursuant to the Side Agreements or Letters of Transmittal.

 



82 (e) For all Tax purposes, all indemnification payments under this
Article 8 shall be treated by the Parties as adjustments to the Merger
Consideration to the extent permitted by applicable law.

 

8.3 _Indemnification of the Stockholders_.  Subject to the
limitations contained in this Article 8, Parent shall hold the Stockholders,
and the members, directors, officers, partners, employees, successors,
assigns, representatives and agents of each of them in their capacities as
such (the " _Stockholder Indemnified Persons_ ") harmless and indemnify each
of them from and against any and all Indemnified Losses incurred or to be
incurred by any of them, resulting from or arising out of:

 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent in
this Agreement or any ancillary document; or

(b) any nonfulfillment, nonperformance, nonobservance or other breach
or violation, or default in performance, by Parent of any covenant or
agreement of Parent contained in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any
ancillary document.

 

8.4 _Notice of Claim_. In the event that Parent seeks
indemnification on behalf of a Parent Indemnified Person, or the
Representative or a Stockholder seeks indemnification on behalf of a
Stockholder Indemnified Person, in each case other than a Third Person Claim,
such Party seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give
reasonably prompt written notice in accordance with Section 10.1 to the
indemnifying Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") specifying the facts
constituting the basis for such claim and the amount, to the extent known, of
the claim asserted; provided, however, that the right of a Person to be
indemnified hereunder shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give
such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party
is actually damaged and prejudiced thereby. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall pay (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds) the amount of any valid and uncontested claim not more than
30 days after the Indemnified Party provides notice to the Indemnifying Party
of such amount. For purposes of this Article 8, the Representative has the
full authority to act on behalf of the Stockholders and the
Stockholder Indemnified Persons as either an Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party, provided that as set forth in this Agreement, Parent shall
be deemed to have given notice to all Stockholders pursuant to giving notice
to the Representative. For purposes of this Section 8.4, Parent shall be
deemed to have provided to the Representative written notice that Parent is
seeking indemnification of any Scheduled Indemnity Matters that are not Third
Person Claims; provided, however, before being entitled to indemnification
for any Losses with respect to such Scheduled Indemnity Matters, Parent shall
provide prompt notice to the Representative upon the reasonable determination
of any such Losses accrued or actually incurred. The Representative shall
have thirty (30) calendar days from the receipt of such notice stating such
amount of Losses to provide Parent and Escrow Agent with any notice of a
dispute in accordance with Section 6 of the Escrow Agreement if the Escrow
Agreement is then in effect.

 



83 _Right to Contest Claims of Third Persons_. 

---|---|--- 
 

(a) If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
hereunder because of a claim asserted by any claimant other than an
Indemnified Person hereunder (a " _Third Person_ "), the Indemnified Party
shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt notice thereof after such
assertion is actually known to the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that
the right of a Person to be indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by
a Third Person shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give such
notice unless, and then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced thereby. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.5,
the Indemnifying Party shall then have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party (a " _Defense Notice_ ") within 30 days after receipt from
the Indemnified Party of notice of such claim, and using counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, to investigate, contest, or settle the
claim alleged by such Third Person (a " _Third Person Claim_ "), provided
that the Indemnifying Party has unconditionally acknowledged to the
Indemnified Party in writing its obligation to indemnify the Persons to be
indemnified hereunder with respect to such Third Person Claim and to
discharge any cost or expense arising out of such investigation, contest or
settlement. The Indemnified Party may thereafter participate in (but not
control) the defense of any such Third Person Claim with its own counsel at
its own expense, unless separate representation is necessary to avoid a
conflict of interest, in which case such representation shall be at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party. Unless and until the Indemnifying Party so
acknowledges its obligation to indemnify, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right, at its option, to assume and control defense of the matter and to
demand and receive from the Indemnifying Party, subject to the Indemnifying
Partys right to dispute its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party,
the full amount of the reasonable costs of defense. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party shall fail to give the Defense Notice within said 30 day
period, (i) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have the control over
said defense and settlement of the subject claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party
will cooperate with and make available to the Indemnified Party such
assistance and materials as it may reasonably request, (iii) the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right at its expense to participate in the defense
assisted by counsel of its own choosing, and (iv) the Indemnifying Party, if
it is required to provide indemnification under this Agreement, will be liable
for all costs and settlement amounts paid or incurred in connection
therewith.

 

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party delivers a Defense
Notice with respect to such Third Person Claim within 30 days after receipt
thereof and thereby elects to conduct the defense of the subject claim, (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to have control over said defense
and, subject to the provisions set forth below, settlement of the subject
claim, (ii) the Indemnified Party will cooperate with and make available to
the Indemnifying Party such assistance and materials as it may reasonably
request, and (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have the rights at its expense
to participate in the defense assisted by counsel of its own choosing. In such
an event, the Indemnifying Party will not settle the subject claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed unless (i) there is no finding
or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any
Person; (ii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in
full by the Indemnifying Party; and (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have no
liability with

 



84 respect to any compromise or settlement of such Third Person Claims effected
without its consent, in which cases the consent of the Indemnified Party
shall not be required.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Section 8.5, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control,
but may participate in, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have
sole control, including the right to select defense counsel, over the defense
or settlement of any claim (i) that seeks a temporary restraining order, a
preliminary or permanent injunction or specific performance against the
Indemnified Party, (ii) that involves criminal allegations against the
Indemnified Party, (iii) that, if unsuccessful, (A) would set a precedent
that would materially interfere with, or have a material adverse effect on,
the business or financial condition of the Indemnified Party or (B) would
reasonably be expected to exceed the then available balance of the Escrow
Account, as mutually determined by the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party or, if such a determination is not made within 15 days after the date on
which the Indemnified Party responds to the Defense Notice by asserting its
rights under this Section 8.5(c), in accordance with its reasonable judgment,
(iv) subject to clause (iii)(B) above, that imposes liability on the part of
the Indemnified Party for which the Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder, or (v) in the case of the Parent Indemnified
Persons, is subject to a claim for indemnification under Section 8.2(a)(v). In
such event, the Indemnifying Party will still be subject to its
obligations hereunder, but the Indemnified Party will not settle the subject
claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 8,
the Company and Stockholders shall not settle or resolve a proposed Tax
adjustment that relates to a taxable period ending after the Closing Date
without the prior written consent of the Parent Indemnified Parties, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(e) With respect to Third Person claims and assertions, if any, that
are included within the Scheduled Indemnity Matters, Representative shall not
have any right to deliver a Defense Notice (other than with respect to the
amount or type of any Losses that any Parent Indemnified Persons claim to
have accrued or actually incurred) with respect to, and agrees that Parent
shall be entitled to control the defense and settlement of, any such Scheduled
Indemnity Matters.

 



     | 8.6 |

_Limitations on Indemnity_. 

---|---|--- 

(a) From and after the Closing, the Parent Indemnified Persons shall
not be entitled to indemnification in respect of any Indemnified Losses
pursuant to (i) Section 8.2(a)(i) unless and until such Indemnified Losses
exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate (the " _Indemnification Threshold_ "), but
thereafter shall be entitled to indemnification in respect of all such
Indemnified Losses to the full extent thereof (including the first $1,000,000
of such Indemnified Losses); provided, however, the Indemnification Threshold
limitation shall not apply in any manner whatsoever to the extent the breach
results from fraud, and (ii) the Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be
entitled to indemnification in respect of any Indemnified Losses pursuant to
Section 8.2(a)(viii) unless and until such Indemnified Losses exceed $100,000
in the aggregate, at which time the Parent Indemnified

 



85 Persons shall be entitled to indemnification in respect of all Indemnified
Losses pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(viii) in excess of the first $100,000 of
such Indemnified Losses.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Parent shall have no obligation
to indemnify Stockholder Indemnified Persons in respect of Indemnified Losses
pursuant to Section 8.3(a) unless and until such Indemnified Losses exceed the
Indemnification Threshold, but thereafter shall be entitled to indemnification
in respect of all such Indemnified Losses to the full extent thereof
(including the first $1,000,000 of such Indemnified Losses).

(c) From and after the Closing, the aggregate amount of Indemnified
Losses that may be recovered by the Parent Indemnified Persons under Sections
8.2(a)(i) and 8.2(a)(viii) shall not exceed $16,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ");
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Cap shall not
apply to the aggregate amount of Indemnified Losses that may be recovered by
the Parent Indemnified Persons for any breach of any representation or
warranty made by the Company in Section 2.14 (Intellectual Property), which
shall be subject to a separate cap of $16,000,000, (ii) the aggregate amount
of Indemnified Losses that may be recovered by the Parent Indemnified Persons
for any breach of Section 2.3 (Capitalization and Related Matters), Section
2.8 (Taxes) hereof shall be the Merger Consideration actually received by
the Stockholders, and (iii) neither the Cap nor any other limitation set
forth in this Section 8.6(c) shall apply in any manner whatsoever to
Indemnified Losses resulting from or arising out of fraud.

 

(d) From and after the Closing, the aggregate amount of
Indemnified Losses that may be recovered by the Stockholder Indemnified
Persons under Section 8.3(a) shall not exceed $16,000,000; provided, however,
such limitation shall not apply in any manner whatsoever to the extent the
breach results from fraud. 

(e) The Stockholders shall not have any claim for contribution from
or against the Surviving Company as a result of any indemnification or other
payments made by any of the Stockholders to any of the Parent Indemnified
Persons pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(f) No information or knowledge acquired, or investigations
conducted, by Parent or its representatives, of the Company or otherwise,
shall in any way limit, or constitute a waiver of, or a defense to, any claim
for indemnification by Parent or any Parent Indemnified Person under this
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) to the extent that prior to the
Closing, in a writing referencing this Section 8.6(f) provided by the General
Counsel of Parent to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the General
Counsel agrees that any specified item of information or knowledge shall
constitute such a limitation, waiver or defense, then such agreement shall
constitute such a limitation, waiver or defense, and (ii) to the extent that
any item of information specifically set forth in a Disclosure Schedule
qualifies a particular representation and warranty and results in the
Companys not being in breach of such representation and warranty, then unless
otherwise provided in such Disclosure Schedule, such item shall constitute
such a limitation, waiver or defense with respect to any such claim for
indemnification based on such representation and warranty. In addition, to the
extent that prior to the Closing, in a writing provided by the General Counsel
of Parent to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the General Counsel
consents to any specified instance of non-

 



86 performance by the Company of a covenant of the Company under this Agreement,
then such consent shall constitute a waiver of, or a defense to, any claim
for indemnification by Parent or any Parent Indemnified Person under this
Agreement with respect to any claim for indemnification based on such non-
performance of the covenant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 8.6(f) shall have any effect on any claim for indemnification under
Sections 8.2(a)(iii) through (viii) hereof.

 

(g) The amount of any Losses claimed by any Indemnified Person
hereunder shall be (i) net of any Tax savings or Tax detriments when and as
actually recognized in cash by any Indemnified Person that is attributable to
such Losses, and (ii) net of any amounts actually recovered under insurance
policies maintained by Parent or the Company; provided, that any increased
insurance premiums and other costs resulting therefrom, together with costs
incurred in making, seeking and pursuing such insurance claim and obtaining
recovery, shall be Losses hereunder. 

(h) Parent and the Representative shall cooperate with each other and
act in good faith with respect to resolving any claim for indemnification
hereunder.

 

(i) In connection with any Losses for which an Indemnified Person
may seek indemnification under this Section 8.6, such Indemnified Person will
in its reasonable discretion use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek
full recovery under available insurance coverage; provided, however, that the
Indemnified Person shall have no obligation to first submit or to collect
upon any applicable insurance coverage as a precondition to making a claim for
indemnification hereunder or obtaining indemnification for Losses therefor,
and the Parties hereto agree, without limiting any other rights any
Indemnifying Party may have against any Indemnified Person, not to delay in
any manner the payment to any Indemnified Person of such indemnification based
on the Indemnified Persons failure to have sought insurance coverage at the
time any such claim is made. If the Indemnified Person receives any such
amounts subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party
(for which the indemnified Losses were not reduced by such amounts),
the Indemnified Person will pay over to the Indemnifying Party (which, in the
case of the Stockholders will be the Escrow Agent (to the extent that (i)
amounts have been paid to Parent out of the Escrow Account and (ii) the Escrow
Agreement remains in effect) or the Representative) the amounts of such
insurance payments promptly after they are actually recovered.

8.7 _Exclusive Remedies_. Following the Closing, anything contained
in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the indemnification rights
set forth in this Article 8, all of which are subject to the terms,
limitations, and restrictions of this Article 8, shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy after Closing for monetary damages sustained as a result of a
breach of a representation or warranty or covenant under this Agreement,
except that the foregoing shall not apply to fraud. In addition, such
limitations set forth in this Article 8 shall not impair the rights of any of
the Parties: (a) to seek non-monetary equitable relief, including (without
limitation) specific performance or injunctive relief to redress any default
or breach of this Agreement, including for the provisions of Article 5 hereof;
or (b) to seek enforcement, collection, damages, or such non-monetary
equitable relief to redress any default or breach of any other agreement to be
delivered at or prior to Closing hereunder. In connection with the

 



87 seeking of any non-monetary equitable relief, each of the Parties acknowledges
and agrees that the other Parties hereto would be damaged irreparably in the
event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the
Parties hereto agrees the other Parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof in accordance with Section 10.9 hereof.

(by wire transfer of immediately available funds) simultaneously with the
occurrence of such Payment Event, a fee equal to $6,400,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ "), and (ii) reimburse Parent (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds), simultaneously with the occurrence of such
Payment Event, for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by or on

Stockholder Non-Competition Agreements, the Letters of Transmittal and the

" _Section 9.1(vi) Payment Event_ " means the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1(vi).

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 10.6 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent and Acquisition
Subsidiary would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company
fails promptly to pay any amount due to Parent pursuant to this Section 10.6,
it shall also pay any costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred
by or on behalf of Parent (or its Affiliates) in connection with a
legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment against the
Company for such amount or is settled in

 



92  favor of Parent, together with interest on any amount of the Termination Fee
or Section 9.1(vi) Payment Fee, as applicable, at a rate per annum equal to
five percent over the prime rate (as published in The Wall Street Journal) in
effect on the date such payment should have been made.

 

10.7 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, all rights and remedies of the Parties under this Agreement
are cumulative and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies under
Law.

 

10.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall in all respects be
construed in accordance with and governed by the substantive laws of the State
of Delaware, without reference to its choice of law rules.

10.9 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers_. Each of the Parties

Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof
brought by a Party hereto or its successors or assigns may be brought and
determined in the federal or state courts located in the State of
Delaware, County of New Castle or the federal courts located in Wilmington,
Delaware, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to
any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect to its property,
generally and unconditionally, to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees
not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim, or otherwise, in
any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that a
Party is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named court
for any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this
Section 10.9, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
court (whether through judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit,
action or proceeding is improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such court. Each Party hereto
waives all personal service of any and all process upon such Party related to

be made by hand delivery, certified mail or confirmed facsimile directed to
such Party at the address specified in Section 10.1 hereof; and service made

condition.

 

10.11 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule or
law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in mutually acceptable manner in order that

 



93  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

10.12 _Amendments_. No modification, amendment or waiver of any
of the provisions of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and
signed by the Parties hereto.

10.13 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The Parties hereby agree
that there are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement, other than
Indemnified Parties.

* * * * 

 



94 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered

OF

 

BREAKINGPOINT SYSTEMS, INC.

FIRST: The name of the Corporation is BreakingPoint Systems, Inc.

 

SECOND: Its registered office in the State of Delaware is located at 160
Greentree Drive, Suite 101, in the City of Dover, County of Kent, 19904. The

per share.

 

FIFTH: All corporate powers of the Corporation shall be exercised by or under
the direction of the Board of Directors except as otherwise provided herein
or by applicable law. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers
conferred by law, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized:

(i) to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws of the Corporation, subject to the
right of the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote with respect
thereto to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws made by the Board of Directors; and

(ii) from time to time to determine whether and to what extent, at
what time and place, and under what conditions and regulations the accounts
and books of the Corporation, or any of them, shall be open to the inspection
of any stockholder; and no stockholder shall have any right to inspect any
account or book or document of the Corporation except as provided by
applicable law or the Bylaws of the Corporation or as authorized by resolution

SIXTH: No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of
fiduciary duty by such director as a director; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not be deemed to eliminate or limit the liability of a

directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for
acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or
a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or (iv) for any transaction from
which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is amended after approval by the
stockholders of this Article Sixth to authorize corporate action further
eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the
liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to
the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware as so amended. This provision is not intended to eliminate or narrow
any defenses to or protection against liability otherwise available to
directors of the Corporation. No amendment to or repeal of this Article shall
apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged

 



A-1   liability of any director of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts
or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment.

 

SEVENTH:

 

A. Every person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party to or is involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by
reason of the fact that such person or a person of whom such person is a legal
representative is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation or for its benefit as a
director, officer, employee or agent of any other corporation, or as the
representative of the Corporation in a partnership, joint venture, trust or
other entity, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the
fullest extent legally permissible under the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware, as amended from time to time, against all
expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines
and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably paid or incurred by
such person in connection therewith. Such right of indemnification shall be a
contract right that may be enforced in any manner desired by such person.
Such right of indemnification shall include the right to be paid by the
Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such action, suit or
proceeding in advance of its final disposition upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if ultimately it should be
determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. If a
claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses hereunder is not paid in
full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been
received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring
suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim, and
if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall also be entitled to be
paid the expenses of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such
action that such indemnification or advancement of costs of defense are not
permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, but the
burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the
failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or any committee
thereof, independent legal counsel, or stockholders) to have made its
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification
of, or advancement of costs of defense to, the claimant is permissible in the
circumstances nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its
Board of Directors or any committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or
stockholders) that such indemnification or advancement is not permissible.

This ESCROW AGREEMENT (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") is made as of _
_, 2012, by and among Ixia, a California corporation (" _Parent_ "),

the Stockholders, and U.S. Bank National Association (the " _Escrow Agent_ ").

_RECITALS_

 

A. Parent, Representative, BreakingPoint Systems, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), and Camden Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation and direct and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Acquisition
Subsidiary_ "), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), dated as of June 30, 2012, pursuant to which, among
other things, the parties thereto agreed to the merger of Acquisition
Subsidiary with and into the Company.

 

B. The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are being
closed (the " _Closing_ ") contemporaneously with the execution of this
Escrow Agreement.

 

C. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, a certain portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be deposited in escrow, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement and this Escrow Agreement.

 

D. The Escrow Agent has agreed to hold the Escrow Funds (as hereinafter
defined) and disburse and apply the same in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Escrow Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the mutual agreements
expressed herein and in the Merger Agreement, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

1. _Defined Terms_. Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Merger Agreement. 

2. _Appointment of Escrow Agent_.  Parent and the Representative, on its own behalf and on behalf of all of the Stockholders, hereby appoint the Escrow Agent to serve as escrow agent hereunder and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to act as escrow agent hereunder and to accept, hold and distribute the Escrow Funds in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions hereof. 

3. _Deposit of Escrow Funds._

3.1. Pursuant to Section 1.9(d) of the Merger Agreement, Parent has
deposited with the Escrow Agent $16,000,000 (the " _Escrow Amount_ "). The
Escrow Agent hereby acknowledges receipt of the Escrow Amount.

3.2. The Escrow Amount and any income earned thereon are referred to
herein collectively as the " _Escrow Funds_." 4. _ Investments._ 

4.1. The Escrow Agent shall cause the Escrow Funds from time to time to
be invested and reinvested as directed in writing by the Representative, in
Authorized Investments, provided that all such investments shall have
appropriately blended maturities but in no event shall any individual
investment mature more than 91 days from the date of investment or
reinvestment. For the purpose of this Escrow Agreement, " _Authorized
Investments_ " means (1) short term interest bearing or discount debt
obligations issued or guaranteed by the Government of the United States
and/or (2) money market funds rated AAA by Standard and Poors which invests
in short term interest bearing or discount debt obligations issued or
guaranteed by the Government of the United States including funds offered

as to investment or reinvestment of funds shall be in writing and shall be
provided to the Escrow Agent no later than 9:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on
the day on which the investment is to be made. Any such direction received
after 9:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time or received on a non-Business Day shall
be deemed to have been given prior to 9:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time the next
Business Day. If a direction is not received, the Escrow Agent shall not have
any obligation to invest the Escrow Funds in Authorized Investments and
pending receipt of same shall be entitled to hold the Escrow Funds un-invested
in its trust account.

 

4.2. All earnings, dividends or other property (including securities)

written statement to Parent and the Representative monthly listing all
transactions with respect to the Escrow Funds during each such period.

4.3. The Escrow Agent shall not be held liable for any losses incurred
in the investments of any funds in Authorized Investments provided that the
Escrow Agent is not grossly negligent or does not act willfully or in bad
faith in connection with such investments.

 

5. _ Application of Escrow Funds to Adjustment Amount_. If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then promptly following the Determination Date and in any event within three Business Days after the Determination Date, Parent and the Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a notice setting forth the amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Adjustment Amount, together with any interest earned on that portion of the Escrow Amount equal to the Adjustment Amount or (ii) the full amount of the Escrow Amount (the " _Adjustment Notice_ "). Upon receipt of any such Adjustment Notice, the Escrow Agent shall promptly pay to Parent out of the Escrow Funds the amount set forth on the Adjustment Notice. 

 

6. _ Application of Escrow Funds to Claims of Parent._

 

6.1. If Parent claims that a Parent Indemnified Person has suffered
Indemnified Losses for which it is entitled to indemnification under Section
8.2 of the Merger Agreement or other Losses pursuant to the Merger Agreement
or in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby at any time prior
to 11:59 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on [the eighteen month anniversary of the
Closing Date] (the " _Second Release Date_ "), Parent shall deliver the
written notice required by Section 8.4 of the Merger Agreement (any notice
from Parent under this Section 6 shall be referred to as a " _Release Notice_
") to the Representative and the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Funds
such amount (the " _Claimed Amount_ "). The 

 



2  parties acknowledge that there may be multiple Release Notices given by
Parent during the term hereof and that any Release Notice may be amended by
Parent from time to time on or prior to the Release Date (e.g., to increase
or decrease the Claimed Amount stated therein), any such amendment being
effective as of and from the date of delivery thereof to the Representative
and the Escrow Agent. The Claimed Amount shall be paid by the Escrow Agent
out of the Escrow Funds to or at the direction of Parent in accordance with
the Release Notice unless the Representative disputes the validity or amount
of such claim by notifying Parent and the Escrow Agent in writing, containing
a description in reasonable detail of the basis for the dispute and the
amount in dispute (a " _Dispute Notice_ "), within thirty (30) calendar days
after Parent has provided the Representative with its Release Notice. If a
Dispute Notice has not been delivered to Parent and the Escrow Agent within
the required thirty (30) calendar day period, the Escrow Agent shall promptly
disburse from the Escrow Funds to or at the direction of Parent the portion of
the Escrow Funds set forth in the Release Notice.

6.2. In the event that a Dispute Notice signed by the Representative
has been provided to Parent and the Escrow Agent within the required thirty
(30) calendar day period, the Escrow Agent shall distribute promptly to or at
the direction of Parent the undisputed portion (if any) of the amount set
forth in the Release Notice, and withhold the amount in dispute (the "
_Disputed Amount_ "), which amount shall be resolved in accordance with this
Section 6.2. The Disputed Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms hereof until the earlier to occur of the following:
(i) the Representative and Parent jointly direct the disbursement of the
Disputed Amount by delivering written instruction to the Escrow Agent, or (ii)
the Escrow Agent receives a copy of a final judgment or order of a court of
competent jurisdiction (a " _Directive_ ") with respect to the Disputed Amount
(which judgment or order shall also be delivered by Parent to the
Representative or by the Representative to Parent, as the case may be). Upon
receipt of such instructions or Directive, or as promptly as practicable but
in no event more than three (3) calendar days after receipt of such
instructions or Directive, the Escrow Agent shall disburse or continue to
hold (as the case may be) the Disputed Amount, as required by such
instructions or Directive, as the case may be.

7. _ Distribution of Escrow Funds_. 

7.1. _First Release Date_. Promptly following 11:59 p.m. Pacific
Standard Time on [the first anniversary of the Closing Date] (the " _First
Release Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall release to the Representative (for
distribution by the Representative to the Stockholders in accordance with this
Section 7) any amounts in the Escrow Account, which are in excess of the
amount equal to (i) eight million dollars ($8,000,000) (the " _Remaining
Escrow Amount_ ") _plus_ (ii) any interest earned on the Remaining Escrow
Amount _plus_ (iii) all Disputed Amounts outstanding on the First Release
Date which have not been resolved in accordance with Section 6 hereof and all
Claimed Amounts that have not then been paid to Parent or disputed by the
Representative in accordance with Section 6 hereof (except that any amount
then comprising Unvested Consideration or forfeited Unvested Consideration and
the interest earned thereon shall be paid to Parent subject to the terms and
conditions of Section 1.7(b) of the Merger Agreement). Following
the resolution of any Disputed Amounts in accordance with Section 6 hereof,
the Escrow Agent shall disburse the Disputed Amounts as provided in the
Directive or in written instructions from Parent and the Representative.

 



3 7.2. _Second Release Date_. Promptly following the Second Release
Date, the Escrow Agent shall release to the Representative (for distribution
by the Representative to the Stockholders in accordance with this Section 7)
the Escrow Funds remaining in the Escrow Account, if any; provided, however,
the Escrow Agent shall retain (and not deliver to the Representative) such
Escrow Funds in the amount equal to (i) all Disputed Amounts outstanding on
the Second Release Date which have not been resolved in accordance with
Section 6 _plus_ (ii) all Claimed Amounts that have not then been paid to
Parent or disputed by the Representative in accordance with Section 6 hereof
(except that any amount then comprising Unvested Consideration or forfeited
Unvested Consideration and the interest earned thereon shall be paid to Parent
subject to the terms and conditions of Section 1.7(b) of the Merger
Agreement). Following the resolution of any Disputed Amounts in accordance
with Section 6 hereof, the Escrow Agent shall disburse the Disputed Amounts as
provided in the Directive or in written instructions from Parent and the
Representative.

 

7.3. _Distribution to Stockholders_. Upon receipt of any amounts from
the Escrow Account by the Representative, the Representative shall promptly
(but in no event later than five (5) calendar days thereafter) distribute all
such amounts (less any reimbursable expenses owed to the Representative
pursuant to Section 1.16 of the Merger Agreement) to the Stockholders, which
are set forth on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto with each Stockholder being
entitled to receive an amount (with respect to each such Stockholder, such
Stockholders " _Pro Rata Amount_ ") equal to the aggregate amount to be so
distributed multiplied by the Percentage set forth next to such Stockholders
name on _Exhibit A_ under the column entitled "Percentage;"
provided, however, if any amounts distributed to Parent pursuant to the terms
hereof were as a result of an indemnity obligation arising under Section
8.2(c) of the Merger Agreement, then (i) any Stockholder whose breach or
violation gave rise to such indemnity obligation shall not be entitled to
such Stockholders Pro Rata Amount, and instead such Stockholder shall only be
entitled to the greater of (A) $0 and (B) the difference between such
Stockholders Pro Rata Amount and the amount distributed to Parent pursuant
to the terms hereof as a result of any such indemnity obligation attributable
to such Stockholder (such amount so distributed to Parent the " _Individual
Obligation Amount_ ") and (ii) each such Individual Obligation Amount shall
be distributed to all other Stockholders in accordance with their Percentages,
with, for this purpose, such Percentages increased on a pro rata basis as
among such other Stockholders in order to allocate the breaching
Stockholders Percentage among such non-breaching Stockholders; provided
further, if at the time of any distribution by the Representative of Escrow
Funds to the Stockholders, any Disputed Amount represents an amount
that Parent has claimed it is entitled to as a result of an indemnity
obligation under Section 8.2(c) of the Merger Agreement (an " _Individual
Obligation Disputed Amount_ "), then (i) all such Escrow Funds other than
any Individual Obligation Disputed Amounts shall be distributed by the
Representative to the Stockholders, with each Stockholder being entitled to
receive its Pro Rata Amount, except that the Stockholder or Stockholders whose
alleged breach or violation is at issue with respect to any such Individual
Obligation Disputed Amount shall only be entitled to receive the difference
between such Stockholders Pro Rata Amount of such distribution and the
Individual Obligation Disputed Amount attributable to such Stockholder and
(ii) all such Individual Obligation Disputed Amounts shall continue to be held
by the Representative until such time as the disputes with respect to such
amounts have been resolved in accordance with the terms hereof, at which time
such Individual Obligation Disputed Amounts shall be distributed by the
Representative in accordance with the terms hereof as if such resolution had
been known at the time of the initial distribution of such Escrow Funds. The
Representative shall deliver to each Stockholder in connection with each
distribution hereunder a statement showing the calculation of the amounts so

 



4  distributed. Promptly following each such distribution, the Representative
shall also deliver to Parent a copy of each such statement so delivered to the
Stockholders, together with a certificate certifying that all amounts
distributed were distributed in accordance with the provisions hereof. Escrow
Agent is not required to make any calculations pursuant to this Section 7.3.

 

8. _ Certain Covenants_. Parent and the Representative, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Stockholders, hereby agree that the interest and other income earned on the Escrow Amount shall be treated for Tax purposes as earned by Parent. Parent and the Representative agree that the Escrow Agent shall report such income to the Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ "), or any other taxing authority, on IRS Form 1099 or IRS Form 1042-S (or other appropriate form) whether or not such income has been distributed during the taxable year. Parent agrees to provide the Escrow Agent with a certified tax identification number by signing and returning an IRS Form W-9 to the Escrow Agent prior to the date on which any income earned on the investment of the Escrow Amount is credited to such Escrow Funds. In addition, Parent and the Representative hereby agree that they will make all reasonable efforts to resolve as quickly as possible any claims still pending pursuant to Section 6 or 7 at the time a disbursement is required to be made hereunder. Parent and the Representative, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Stockholders, hereby agree that, upon release of cash from the Escrow Account, a portion of any cash distributed to Stockholders shall be treated as interest in accordance with Section 483 or 1274 of the Code. For Tax Purposes only, in no event shall the total amount of the Escrow Funds paid to the Stockholders under this Agreement exceed $17,000,000. 

 

9. _ Joint Written Instructions and Directions; Disbursements_.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall deal with the Escrow Funds, or any part thereof, at any time in accordance with any directions given in an undisputed Release Notice or jointly given in writing by Parent and the Representative to the Escrow Agent or in a Directive. The parties hereto agree that all disbursements required to be made hereunder shall be made to the Representative by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the wire transfer instructions specified in the notice directing the Escrow Agent to make such disbursement and to or at the direction of Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the wire transfer instructions specified in the notice directing the Escrow Agent to make such disbursement. 

 

10. _ Provisions Concerning the Escrow Agent._

 

10.1. This Escrow Agreement sets forth, exclusively, the duties of the
Escrow Agent and no additional duties or obligations shall be inferred
herefrom or implied hereby.

 

10.2. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for the validity of any
documents or other property delivered to it pursuant hereto, may act and rely
conclusively upon any instrument or signature believed by it to be genuine and
may assume that any person purporting to give any notice or instructions
hereunder, believed by the Escrow Agent to be authorized, has been duly
authorized so to do. Concurrently with the execution of this Escrow Agreement,
Parent shall provide the Escrow Agent with a list of authorized signers in the
form of _Exhibit C_ hereto.

 

10.3. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error of judgment,
or for any act done or step taken or omitted by it in good faith, or for any
mistake of fact or law, or for anything which it may in good faith do or
refrain from doing in connection herewith, except to the

 



5  extent that any act or omission constitutes gross negligence or willful
misconduct. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special, indirect
or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not
limited to, lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of such
loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

10.4. The Escrow Agent may consult with, and obtain advice from, legal
counsel in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction of any
of the provisions hereof or its duties hereunder, and it shall incur no
liability and shall be fully protected in acting in good faith in accordance
with the advice of such counsel.

10.5. The Escrow Agent shall not be bound by any modification of this
Escrow Agreement unless it shall have specifically consented thereto in
writing. 

10.6. The Representative, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other
hand, shall each upon demand pay to the Escrow Agent fifty percent (50%) of
the amount of all reasonable fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent as further
described in _Exhibit B_ , including the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel, which the Escrow Agent may incur, and its normal fees for all
services rendered, in each case in connection with the discharge of its
duties, and the exercise or enforcement of the rights of the parties
hereunder. The Escrow Agent may deduct any unpaid fees from the Escrow Funds.
In the event the Escrow Agent deducts any unpaid fees for which Parent is
responsible hereunder from the Escrow Funds, Parent shall promptly deposit
into the Escrow Account Parents portion of such unpaid fees and in the event
the Escrow Agent deducts any unpaid fees for which any of the Stockholders is
responsible hereunder from the Escrow Funds, the Representative shall promptly
deposit into the Escrow Account such Stockholders portion of such unpaid
fees. 

10.7. The Escrow Agent may resign by giving written notice to Parent
and the Representative of such resignation, specifying a date upon which such
resignation shall take effect, which shall in no event be earlier than sixty
(60) days after the giving of such notice, and shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations upon the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent as
hereafter provided and the delivery to such successor of the Escrow Funds.
Immediately upon receipt of such notice, Parent and the Representative shall
appoint a successor Escrow Agent who shall be mutually acceptable to them.
Any such successor Escrow Agent shall deliver to Parent and the Representative
and to the resigning Escrow Agent a written instrument accepting such
appointment hereunder, and thereupon it shall succeed to all the rights and
duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder, and shall be entitled to receive the
Escrow Funds. In the event that a successor Escrow Agent shall not be so
appointed by the date of resignation specified by the Escrow Agent, the
Escrow Agent shall have the right to petition a court of competent
jurisdiction to appoint a successor escrow agent.

 

10.8. In the event of any dispute between Parent or the Representative,
or between the Escrow Agent and any one or more of the other parties hereto,
with regard to the Escrow Agent or its duties, or any other matter concerning
the disposition of the Escrow Funds or in the event that the Escrow Agent, in
good faith, is in doubt as to what action it should take hereunder, the
Escrow Agent may (a) refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation
shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall be given a
direction in writing by the parties which eliminates such ambiguity or
uncertainty to the satisfaction of Escrow Agent and/or (b) deposit the Escrow
Funds with any court described in Section 10.9 of the Merger Agreement

 



6  pending the decision of such court, and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled
to refrain from action pending, and rely upon, the decision of such court. The
rights of the Escrow Agent under this Section 10.8 are cumulative of all
other rights which it may have by law or otherwise.

 

10.9. The Escrow Agent is hereby severally and not jointly indemnified
by Parent and Representative from and against any loss, liability or expense
reasonably incurred, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel,
which the Escrow Agent may incur, and its normal fees for all services
rendered, in each case in connection with the discharge of its duties, and
the exercise or enforcement of the rights of the parties hereunder, without
gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of
or in connection with the Escrow Agreement, including the expense of
defending itself against any claim or liability arising therefrom. The Escrow
Agent shall not be required to give any bond or surety or report to any court
despite any statute, custom or rule to the contrary. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent and the Representative agree that any payment required
to be made pursuant to this Section 10.9 shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by
Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the Representative. The Escrow Agent may
deduct any unpaid amounts from the Escrow Funds. In the event the Escrow
Agent deducts any unpaid amounts for which Parent is responsible under this
Section 10.9 from the Escrow Funds, Parent shall promptly deposit into the
Escrow Account Parents portion of such unpaid amounts and in the event the
Escrow Agent deducts any unpaid amounts for which the Representative is
responsible hereunder from the Escrow Funds, the Representative shall promptly
deposit into the Escrow Account the Representatives portion of such unpaid
amounts.

10.10. Parent and the Representative together may terminate the
appointment of the Escrow Agent hereunder upon written notice specifying the
date upon which such termination shall take effect. In the event of such
termination, Parent and the Representative shall before the date of such
termination jointly appoint a successor Escrow Agent, and the Escrow Agent
shall deliver the remaining Escrow Funds to such successor Escrow Agent.

11. _ Provisions Concerning the Representative._

11.1. Until the later of the Second Release Date or the date on which
no Escrow Funds remain held in escrow hereunder, the Representative shall, and
shall have full power and authority to, exclusively act on behalf of each
Stockholder in connection with all matters relating to this Escrow Agreement
and the Merger Agreement. The Representative shall also have full power and
authority to give and receive notices by or on behalf of each Stockholder.

11.2. By giving notice to the Representative in the manner provided by
Section 12, a party shall be deemed to have given notice to all of the
Stockholders and any action taken by the Representative may be considered by
any other party to be the action of each such Stockholder for all purposes,
including for all purposes of this Escrow Agreement and the Merger Agreement.
In addition, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i) none of the
Stockholders shall be entitled to individually take any action which the
Representative is authorized hereunder to take on behalf of such Stockholders
and (ii) the failure of the Representative to take any action it is permitted
or authorized to take hereunder on behalf of the Stockholders during the
applicable time period in which such action is permitted to have been taken by
the Representative, including, without limitation, providing any Dispute
Notice hereunder or under the Merger Agreement, shall be deemed for all
purposes to constitute a complete waiver and release by each Stockholder of
the right to individually take any such action.

 



7 11.3. In the event that the Representative is unable or refuses to serve,
the Stockholders will promptly notify Parent and the Escrow Agent in writing
of the designation by the Stockholders of a successor to act as the
Representative hereunder.

 

12. _Notices and Written Directions._ All notices, requests, demands, and other communications required or permitted under this Escrow Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given and made upon being delivered either by courier or fax delivery to the party for whom it is intended and by depositing such notice, postage prepaid, certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, in the United States mail, bearing the address shown in this Section 12 for, or such other address as may be designated in writing hereafter by, such party:

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity, the Escrow Agent will ask for documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. The Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements, licenses, identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. 

 

25. _Security Advice Waiver_. The parties hereto acknowledge that regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency grant them the right to receive brokerage confirmations of security transactions as they occur. The parties hereby specifically waive such notification to the extent permitted by law and acknowledge that they will receive periodic cash transaction statements, which will detail all investment transactions.

IV. Extraordinary Fees (if any):

Extraordinary fees are payable to the Escrow Agent for duties or
responsibilities not expected to be incurred at the outset of the transaction,
not routine or customary, and not incurred in the ordinary course of
business. Payment of extraordinary fees is appropriate where particular
inquiries, events or developments are unexpected, even if the possibility of
such things could have been identified at the inception of the transaction.
Extraordinary services might include, without limitation, amendments or
supplements, specialized reporting, non-routine calculations, foreign currency
conversions, use investments not automated with the Escrow Agents trust
accounting system, and actual or threatened litigation or arbitration
proceedings.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT

 

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering
activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain,
verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an
account. For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a charity, a
trust or other legal entity, the Escrow Agent will ask for documentation to
verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. The Escrow Agent may
also ask to see financial statements, licenses, identification and
authorization documents from individuals claiming authority to represent the
entity or other relevant documentation.

 

BENEFICIAL OWNER DIRECTIVE REGARDING THE SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF
1985,

SEC RULE 14B-2

 

The Shareholder Communications Act of 1985 and its regulation require that
banks and trust companies make an effort to facilitate communication
between registrants of U.S. securities and the parties who have the authority
to vote or direct the voting of those securities regarding proxy dissemination
and other corporate communications. Unless Parent or the Representative
indicate its   objection in writing, the Escrow Agent will provide the obligatory
information to the registrant upon request. Such objection will apply to all
securities held for Parent and the Representative in the account now and in
the future unless Parent or the Representative, as applicable, notify the
Escrow Agent in writing.

[ _ _], 2012

26601 W. Agoura Rd.

Calabasas, CA 91302

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

Reference is made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 30,
2012 (the "Agreement"), by and among Ixia, a California corporation (the
"Parent"), Camden Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Parent ("Newco"), BreakingPoint Systems, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), and Desmond P. Wilson III in his capacity as
Stockholders Representative, which provides for the merger of Newco with and
into the Company (the "Merger"). This opinion letter is delivered to the
Parent pursuant to Section 1.8(d) of the Agreement, and all capitalized terms
used herein have the meanings defined for them in the Agreement unless
otherwise defined herein. Reference in this opinion letter to the Agreement
excludes any schedule or substantive agreement attached as an exhibit to the
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated herein.

 

We have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with the negotiation,
execution and delivery of the Agreement. In connection with this opinion, we
have made such legal and factual examinations and inquiries as we have deemed
advisable or necessary for the purpose of rendering the opinions and
statements set forth below. In addition, we have reviewed originals or copies
of such corporate records of the Company, certificates of public officials, a
certificate of an officer of the Company as to factual matters (the "Officers
Certificate") and such other documents that we consider necessary or
advisable for the purpose of rendering the opinions and statements set forth
below. We have not independently established the facts stated therein. In such
examination we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the
authenticity and completeness of all documents submitted to us as originals
and the conformity to original documents of all copies submitted to us. In
making our examination of documents, we have assumed that each party to any
such document (other than the Company in connection with the Agreement) has
satisfied those requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary
to make such document a valid and binding obligation of such party,
enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms. The opinions
below are not affected by the electronic delivery of signatures.

We have assumed that (i) the representations and warranties as to factual
matters made by the parties to the Agreement and pursuant thereto are correct,
(ii) the representations and warranties made by officers of the Company as to
factual matters made in the Officers Certificate and other certificates
delivered in connection with the Agreement are correct, and (iii) the parties
to the Agreement have complied and will comply with their obligations under
the Agreement. We have also assumed that there are no extrinsic agreements or
understandings among the parties to the  Agreement that would modify or affect the terms or interpretation of the
Agreement or the respective rights or obligations of the parties thereunder.

 

As used in the opinions or statements set forth below, the expressions "to our
knowledge," "known to us" or similar language with reference to matters of
fact mean that, after an examination of documents made available to us by the
Company, and after inquiries of the Companys officers, but without any
further independent factual investigation, we find no reason to believe that
the opinions expressed herein are factually incorrect. Further, the
expressions "to our knowledge," "known to us" or similar language refer to the
current actual knowledge of the attorneys of this firm who have rendered
legal services in connection with the Merger. Except to the extent expressly
set forth herein, we have not undertaken any independent investigation to
determine the existence or absence of any fact, and no inference as to our
knowledge of the existence or absence of any fact should be drawn from our
representation of the Company or the rendering of the opinions or statements
set forth below.

 

Our opinion is based upon current laws, statutes, rules, regulations, cases
and official interpretive opinions. We are members of the Bar of the State of
Texas, and we are not expressing any opinion as to any matter relating to the
laws (including any governmental statute, rule or regulation) of any
jurisdiction other than the laws of the United States of America, the laws of
the State of Texas and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the "DGCL") (based solely on our review of standard compilations of the DGCL)
that, in our experience, are generally applicable to transactions of the
nature of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.

In rendering the opinions set forth in paragraph 1 below as to due
incorporation, valid existence, good standing and qualification to do
business, we have relied solely upon a copy of the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company certified by the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware and certificates of the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts and the Secretary of State
of the State of Texas evidencing the corporate status of the Company.

 

In rendering the opinions set forth in paragraph 5 below, we have relied
solely upon a review of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Company, minute book records relating to meetings and written actions of the
Board of Directors and stockholders of the Company in our possession or made
available to us by the Company, stock records of the Company in our
possession or made available to us by the Company and statements in the
Officers Certificate relating to the capitalization of the Company, including
a statement to the effect that the Company has received consideration in the
amount and in the form specified by the Board of Directors for all of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company.

 

The opinions hereinafter expressed are subject to the following additional
qualifications:

 

(a) We express no opinion as to the effect of applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar federal
or state laws affecting the rights of creditors;

 



 

- 2 \- (b) We express no opinion as to the effect of general principles of
equity, including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness,
good faith and fair dealing, and the possible unavailability of specific
performance or injunctive relief, regardless of whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law;

(c) We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any provision of
the Agreement (i) purporting to waive broadly or vaguely stated rights,
unknown future defenses, rights to damages, rights to jury trials or the
benefits of other statutory, regulatory or constitutional rights that cannot
be waived or, if they can be waived, cannot be waived prospectively; (ii)
providing for a choice of venue; (iii) imposing penalties, forfeitures or
liquidated damages; or (iv) prescribing or varying rules of evidence, method
or quantum of proof or other legal standards in a manner contrary to
applicable statutes and rules of law;

 

(d) We express no opinion as to the enforceability of indemnification
and contribution provisions to the extent they may be subject to limitations
of public policy and the effect of applicable statutes and rules of law;

(e) We express no opinion as to compliance with applicable securities
laws;

 

(f) We express no opinion as to the effect, if any, of federal and
state laws and regulations dealing with antitrust and unfair competition
matters and filing and notice requirements (including, but not limited to, the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended);

 

(g) We express no opinion as to compliance with applicable
antifraud statutes, rules or regulations of applicable United States federal
or state laws concerning the issuance or sale of securities, including,
without limitation, (1) the accuracy and completeness of the information
provided by Parent and the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement, and (2) the accuracy or fairness of the past,
present or future fair market value of any securities;

 

(h) We express no opinion as to the valid and binding effect
or enforceability of any choice of law provisions set forth in the Agreement
and we express no opinion as to the valid and binding effect or enforceability
of any provision contained in the Agreement that purports to establish
particular courts as the forum for the adjudication of any controversy
relating to such Agreement;

 

(i) We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any of
the agreements attached as exhibits to the Agreement;

(j) We have assumed that the members of the Companys Board of
Directors and the Companys stockholders have satisfied all fiduciary duties
applicable to approval of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
the Agreement; and

 



 

- 3 \- (k) We express no opinion as to whether the Agreement may be void or
voidable pursuant to Section 144 of the DGCL. We call your attention to the
fact that certain members of the Companys Board of Directors have material
financial interests in the Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement. We have assumed with your consent that (i) such transactions are
fair, just and reasonable to the Company at the time of their authorization,
approval or ratification by the Companys Board of Directors and stockholders
within the meaning of Section 144 of the DGCL; (ii) the information provided
by the Company to Parent, Newco or the Companys security holders in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement is true and
complete; and (iii) all material facts as to the interests of the Companys
officers and directors as to the Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby have been disclosed to the Companys security holders.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and except as set forth in the
Disclosure Schedule to the Agreement, and subject to the further assumptions,
limitations, qualifications, and exceptions set forth herein, we are of the
opinion that:

1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is in good standing under such laws. The Company has the corporate power to carry on its business as currently conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in the State of Texas. 

 

2. The Company has the requisite corporate power to execute and deliver the Agreement and to carry out and perform its obligations under the terms of the Agreement. 

 

3. All corporate action on the part of the Company, its directors and stockholders necessary for the authorization, execution and delivery of the Agreement by the Company and the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Agreement has been taken. 

 

4. The Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company, and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be subject to (i) any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other Law relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law). 

 

5. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 125,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, 16,430,845 shares (including 9,888,345 Restricted Shares) of which are issued and outstanding, and 25,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, 5,500,000 of which shares have been designated as Series A Preferred Stock, 4,950,000 of which shares are issued and outstanding, 1,469,600 of which shares have been designated as Series B Preferred Stock, all of which shares are issued and outstanding, 2,290,620 of which shares have been designated as Series C Preferred Stock, all of which shares are issued and outstanding, and 850,000 of which shares have been designated as Series D Preferred Stock, 758,757 of which shares are issued and outstanding. All of such issued and outstanding shares have been duly authorized and validly issued and, to our knowledge, are fully paid and nonassessable. The Board of 

 



 

- 4 \-  Directors of the Company has adopted resolutions reserving (i) 11,590,000
shares of Common Stock for issuance under the Companys Amended and Restated
2005 Incentive Plan (the "Stock Plan"). The currently outstanding shares of
Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock have been duly authorized and
validly issued and, to our knowledge, are fully paid and nonassessable. To
our knowledge, except as described above or as set forth in the Agreement, the
Disclosure Schedule, or in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the
Company, there are no other presently outstanding preemptive rights, options,
warrants, conversion privileges or rights in writing to purchase from the
Company any of the authorized but unissued capital stock of the Company.

 

6. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Agreement, the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder at the Closing, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby at the Closing will not result in a violation of any provision of the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws. 

* * * 

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, we advise you that we are not
aware of any lawsuit pending against the Company nor, to our knowledge, has
the Company received any written threat thereof. We note that we have not
conducted a docket search in any jurisdiction with respect to lawsuits that
may be pending against the Company.

* * * 

This opinion letter is rendered as of the date first written above and
furnished to the Parent solely for its benefit in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement, and may not be relied upon by any
other person or for any other purpose without our prior written consent.
Our opinion is expressly limited to the matters set forth above and we render
no opinion, whether by implication or otherwise, as to any other matters
relating to the Company. We assume no obligation to inform you of any facts,
circumstances, events or changes in the law that may arise or be brought to
our attention after the date of this opinion letter that may alter, affect or
modify the opinions or statements expressed herein.

In order to induce Parent to cause U.S. Bank National Association (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") to issue the consideration for the Shares called for by
the Merger Agreement, the undersigned hereby expressly agrees with Parent as
follows:

1. _Merger Agreement; Escrow Agreement_. The undersigned acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Merger Agreement (included herewith) and the Escrow Agreement (included herewith). The undersigned has reviewed those documents and the terms of the Merger described therein. The undersigned understands that the Escrow Amount 

 



2  will be retained in the Escrow Account to satisfy, at least in part, any
claims by (i) Parent for satisfaction of any post-closing adjustment pursuant
to Section 1.12 of the Merger Agreement, (ii) any Parent Indemnified Person
for any indemnification claim of any Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to
Section 8.2 of the Merger Agreement or (iii) any Parent Indemnified Person
pursuant to the Merger Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (in accordance with the terms of Section
1.12 of the Merger Agreement). The undersigned approves and ratifies the
appointment of the Representative (and any successor Representative appointed
in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement) as representative and
attorney-in-fact and agent for and on behalf of the Stockholder to act as the
Representative in all respects as specified in Section 1.16 of the Merger
Agreement and in the Escrow Agreement; and authorizes and empowers the
Representative to act on the behalf of the undersigned and in its stead, and
to bind the undersigned, with respect to all matters relating to the Merger
Agreement, to the extent set forth in Section 1.16 therein, and the Escrow
Agreement. The undersigned acknowledges and agrees to be subject to and bound
by the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
substantially in the form included herewith, with such changes as the
officers of the Company may approve. The undersigned further acknowledges that
the Merger Consideration is subject to certain adjustments more specifically
described in Section 1.4 to the Merger Agreement.

2. _Representations and Warranties_. The undersigned is the exclusive owner of the Shares listed on this Letter of Transmittal, of record and beneficially, free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances, and has the right and power to submit them for transfer with this Letter of Transmittal. The undersigned has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Letter of Transmittal and to perform his, her or its obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of this Letter of Transmittal constitute a valid and binding obligation of the undersigned, enforceable against him, her or it in accordance with its terms. No permit, consent, waiver, approval or authorization of, or declaration to or filing or registration with, any Government authority or third party is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of this Letter of Transmittal by the undersigned. Neither the execution and delivery of this Letter of Transmittal nor the consummation of any or all of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws and any amendments thereto (or other governing instrument) of the undersigned, if any, or (ii) violate, be in conflict with, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under any agreement or commitment to which the undersigned is a party or (iii) violate any statute or law or any judgment, decree, order, regulation or rule of any court or other governmental body applicable to the undersigned. 

The undersigned has received and carefully reviewed the Information Statement
delivered together with this Letter of Transmittal. The undersigned has had
the opportunity to ask the Company any and all questions the undersigned may
have with respect to the Information Statement, the Merger Agreement and any
related documents and has also had the opportunity to consult with the
undersigneds tax, financial, legal and other advisors regarding the same.

3.   _Indemnification_. Article 8 of the Merger Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by reference. By virtue of such incorporation by reference, the undersigned and the Company shall be entitled to all of the benefits, and subject to all of the obligations, contained in such Article. 

 

4. _Federal Income Tax Considerations_. Each Stockholder who is a U.S. person and who is to receive the Stockholder Consideration in the Merger will be required to furnish the Stockholders social security number or taxpayer identification number on Substitute Form W-9. Failure to provide this information may result in backup withholding. Each Stockholder who is a Non-U.S. person and who is to receive the Stockholder Consideration in the Merger will be required to furnish a Substitute Form W-8BEN or other appropriate Form W-8. 

EACH STOCKHOLDER IS URGED TO CONSULT WITH THE STOCKHOLDERS OWN TAX ADVISOR
REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THE STOCKHOLDERS
OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

 

5. _Further Actions_. The undersigned will, upon request, execute and deliver any additional documents reasonably deemed appropriate or necessary by the Exchange Agent in connection with the surrender of the certificates that formerly represented the Shares. 

 

This Letter of Transmittal shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding the death or incapacity of one or more or the undersigned,
and shall be binding upon the heirs, personal representatives, successors and
assigns of the undersigned.

4 INSTRUCTIONS TO LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL

 

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement referred to in the Letter of Transmittal, the
Acquisition Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company and the
outstanding shares of the Companys common stock will be converted into the
right to receive the Initial Merger Consideration and, if applicable, a
portion of the Escrow Amount and any additional positive Adjustment Amount
(the " _Stockholder Consideration_ "). In order to receive payment of the
Stockholder Consideration, the certificates or other documentation that
formerly represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") must be forwarded in
accordance with the following instructions. Capitalized terms used but
otherwise not defined herein or in the Letter of Transmittal shall have the
meanings assigned to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

 

1\. Letter of Transmittal.

 

The Letter of Transmittal should be properly filled in, signed and returned,
together with the surrendered Certificates, to Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and
Rosati, Professional Corporation at the address set forth above, so that it
may be forwarded to U.S. Bank National Association (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").
The Letter of Transmittal and Certificates may be mailed or delivered by hand
to the address shown on the face of this Letter of Transmittal. The method of
delivery of all documents is at the option and risk of the surrendering
Stockholder, but if sent by mail, registered mail with return receipt
requested, properly insured, is recommended.

2.  Certificates in Different Names.

This Letter of Transmittal may be used to submit more than one Certificate
only if all of the Certificates are registered in exactly the same name.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many Letters
of Transmittal as there are different registrations of Certificates. If the
Stockholder Consideration is to be issued to someone other than the registered
owner(s) of the surrendered Certificate(s), the Certificate(s) must be duly
endorsed in blank by the registered owner(s) thereof or accompanied by a duly
executed instrument of assignment in blank, and the signature to the
endorsement or assignment must be guaranteed by a commercial bank or trust
company (not a savings bank) or a member of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, and the information under "Special Payment Instructions"
must be supplied. If any of the Stockholder Consideration is to be mailed to
an address different from the record address of your Shares, provide the
information under "Special Mailing Instructions."

3.  Signatures.

This Letter of Transmittal shall be signed by the registered holder(s) of the
Certificates submitted herewith. The signatures must correspond with the
name(s) as set forth on the face of the Certificate(s), without alteration,
enlargement or any change whatsoever. If the Certificate(s) submitted
herewith are held of record by two or more joint owners, all such Stockholders
must sign this Letter of Transmittal. When the Letter of Transmittal is
properly signed by the registered holder, no endorsements of certificates or
separate stock powers are required.

If this Letter of Transmittal or any Certificates are signed by
trustees, executors, administrators, guardians, attorneys-in-fact, officers
of corporations or others acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity,
such persons should so indicate when signing and proper evidence satisfactory
to the Exchange Agent of their authority so to act must be submitted.

If you are married and reside in a community property state (including
Texas), both you and your spouse must sign the Letter of Transmittal.

 



5 4. Lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed Certificates. 

If your Certificates have been lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed, please
indicate above and complete and execute the Affidavit of Lost Certificate
attached hereto as _Annex 1._ Upon proper completion of the Affidavit, you
will have the same rights to the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration to which you are entitled under the Merger Agreement as if you
had delivered the lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed Certificate.

5. Validity of Surrender; Irregularities. 

All questions as to validity, form and eligibility of any surrender of
Certificates hereunder will be determined by the Exchange Agent, and such
determination will be final and binding. The Exchange Agent reserves the
right to waive any irregularities or defects in the surrender of any
Certificates, and its interpretations of the terms and conditions of this
Letter of Transmittal (including these instructions) with respect to such
irregularities or defects will be final and binding. A surrender will not be
deemed to have been made until all irregularities have been cured or waived.

6. Important Tax Information. 

Under United States federal income tax laws, a Stockholder whose Shares are
surrendered herewith is required to provide the Exchange Agent with such
Stockholders current Taxpayer Identification Number ("TIN") on the enclosed
Substitute Form W-9. If such Stockholder is an individual, the TIN is his or
her Social Security number. For businesses and other entities, the number is
the Employer Identification Number. If the Exchange Agent is not provided
with the correct TIN, the Stockholder may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed
by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"). In addition, the Stockholder
Consideration to which the Stockholder is entitled with respect to Shares
surrendered in connection with the Merger and any interest earnings on the
Escrow Amount may be subject to backup withholding.

Certain Stockholders are not subject to these backup withholding and reporting
requirements. See the enclosed W-9 Guidelines for additional instructions.
Exempt Stockholders that are U.S. persons should furnish their TIN, check the
"Exempt from backup withholding" box on the Substitute Form W-9, and sign,
date and return the Substitute Form W-9 to Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati,
Professional Corporation at the address set forth above, so that it may be
forwarded to the Exchange Agent.

If backup withholding applies, the Exchange Agent is required to withhold a
portion (currently 28%) of any cash payment made to the Stockholder with
respect to Shares surrendered in connection with the Merger Agreement and any
interest earnings on the Escrow Account. Backup withholding is not
an additional tax. Rather, the amount of backup withholding is treated as an
advance payment of a tax liability and a Stockholders United States federal
income tax liability will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If
withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund from the IRS may
generally be obtained by the Stockholder, provided that the necessary
information is properly furnished to the IRS.

 

 _Purpose of Substitute Form W-9_

 

To prevent backup withholding on any cash payment made to a Stockholder with
respect to the Shares surrendered in connection with the Merger Agreement and
any interest earnings on the Escrow Amount, the Stockholder is required to
notify the Exchange Agent of his or her correct TIN (Social Security number or
Employer Identification Number) by completing the enclosed Substitute Form
W-9 and certifying that the TIN provided on Substitute Form W-9 is correct (or
that such Stockholder is awaiting a TIN). A Stockholder is also required to
certify on Substitute Form W-9 that (i) the Stockholder is exempt from backup
withholding, or (ii) the Stockholder has not been notified by the IRS that it
is subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all
interest or dividends, or (iii) the IRS has notified the holder 

 



6  that the Stockholder is no longer subject to backup withholding. In
addition, the Stockholder must complete Part 2 of the Substitute Form W-9,
check the appropriate box, and date and sign as indicated.

_What Number to Give the Exchange Agent_

 

The Stockholder is required to give the Exchange Agent the Social Security
number or Employer Identification Number of the record owner of the Shares
being surrendered for payment in connection with the Merger Agreement. If the
Shares are held in more than one name, consult the Guidelines for
Certification of Taxpayer Identification on Substitute Form W-9
for information on which TIN to report.

_Substitute Form W-8BEN for Stockholders that are Non-United States Persons_

If the surrendering Stockholder is a nonresident alien or foreign entity not
subject to backup withholding, instead of submitting a Substitute Form W-9,
such Stockholder must give the Exchange Agent a completed Substitute Form
W-8BEN  Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States
Tax Withholding, or other appropriate Form W-8, signed under penalties of
perjury. If a nonresident alien or foreign entity Stockholder does not provide
the Exchange Agent with a Substitute Form W-8BEN, or other appropriate Form
W-8, the Stockholder will be subject to backup withholding on reportable
payments.

Page 2

Purpose of Form

A person who is required to file an information return with the IRS must get
your correct Taxpayer Identification Number ("TIN") to report, for example,
income paid to you, real estate transactions, mortgage interest you paid,
acquisition or abandonment of secured property, cancellation of debt, or
contributions you made to an IRA. Use Form W-9 only if you are U.S. person
(including a resident alien), to provide your correct TIN to the requester
(the person requesting your TIN) and, when applicable, to (1) certify the TIN
you are giving is correct (or you are waiting for a number to be issued), (2)
certify you are not subject to backup withholding, or (3) claim exemption from
backup withholding if you are a U.S. exempt payee. If applicable, you are also
certifying that as a U.S. person, your allocable share of any partnership
income from a U.S. trade or business is not subject to the withholding tax on
foreign partners share of effectively connected income The TIN provided must
match the name given on the Substitute Form W-9.

Definition of a U.S. person. For federal tax purposes, you are considered a
U.S. person if you are:

     |  |  |

An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien, 

---|---|---|--- 
     |  |  |

A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or organized in
the United States or under the laws of the United States,  

---|---|---|--- 
     |  |  |

An estate (other than a foreign estate), or 

---|---|---|--- 
     |  |  |

A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7). 

---|---|---|--- 
 

Special rules for partnerships. Partnerships that conduct a trade or business
in the United States are generally required to pay a withholding tax on any
foreign partners share of income from such business. Further, in certain
cases where a Form W-9 has not been received, a partnership is required to
presume that a partner is a foreign person, and pay the withholding
tax. Therefore, if you are a U.S. person that is a partner in a partnership
conducting a trade or business in the United States, provide Form W-9 to the
partnership to establish your U.S. status and avoid withholding on your share
of partnership income. The person who gives Form W-9 to the partnership for
purposes of establishing its U.S. status and avoiding withholding on its
allocable share of net income from the partnership conducting a trade or
business in the United States is in the following cases:



     |  |  |

The U.S. owner of a disregarded entity and not the entity, 

---|---|---|--- 
     |  |  |

The U.S. grantor or other owner of a grantor trust and not the trust, and 

---|---|---|--- 
     |  |  |

The U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust) and not the beneficiaries of the
trust. 

---|---|---|--- 
 

Foreign person. If you are a foreign person, do not use Form W-9. Instead, use
the appropriate Form W-8 (see Publication 515, Withholding of Tax on
Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities).

Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien. Generally, only a nonresident
alien individual may use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S.
tax on certain types of income. However, most tax treaties contain a provision
known as a "saving clause." Exceptions specified in the saving clause may
permit an exemption from tax to continue for certain types of income even
after the payee has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes.

If you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an exception contained in
the saving clause of a tax treaty to claim an exemption from U.S. tax on
certain types of income, you must attach a statement to Form W-9 that
specifies the following five items:

1\. The treaty country. Generally, this must be the same treaty under which
you claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien.

2\. The treaty article addressing the income.

 

3\. The article number (or location) in the tax treaty that contains the
saving clause and its exceptions.

 

4\. The type and amount of income that qualifies for the exemption from tax.



 

5\. Sufficient facts to justify the exemption from tax under the terms of the
treaty article.

 

 _Example._ Article 20 of the U.S.-China income tax treaty allows an exemption
from tax for scholarship income received by a Chinese student temporarily
present in the United States. Under U.S. law, this student will become a
resident alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in the United States
exceeds 5 calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol to the
U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30, 1984) allows the provisions of Article 20
to continue to apply even after the Chinese student becomes a resident alien
of the United States. A Chinese student who qualifies for this exception
(under paragraph 2 of the first protocol) and is relying on this exception to
claim an exemption from tax on his or her scholarship or fellowship income
would attach to Form W-9 a statement that includes the information described
above to support that exemption.

 

If you are a nonresident alien or a foreign entity not subject to backup
withholding, give the requester the appropriate completed Form W-8.

 

Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)

If you are a resident alien and you do not have and are not eligible to get
an SSN, your TIN is your IRS individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN).
Enter this number in the social security number box. If you do not have an
ITIN, see _How to get a TIN_ below.

If you are a sole proprietor and you have an EIN, you may enter either your
SSN or EIN. However, the IRS prefers that you use your SSN. If you are a
single-member LLC that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner,
enter the owners SSN (or EIN, if the owner has one). Do not enter the
disregarded entitys EIN. If the LLC is classified as a corporation or
partnership, enter the entitys EIN.

Page 3

How to Get a TIN

If you do not have a TIN, apply for one immediately. To apply for an SSN,
obtain Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security Card, at the local office
of the Social Security Administration or get this form on-line at
_www.ssa.gov/online/ss-5.pdf_. You may also get this form by
calling 1-800-772-1213. You can apply for an EIN online by accessing the IRS
website at _www.irs.gov/businesses_ and clicking on Employer ID Numbers under
Related Topics. Use Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer
Identification Number, to apply for an ITIN, or Form SS-4, Application for
Employer Identification Number, to apply for an EIN. You can get Forms W-7 and
SS-4 from the IRS by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676) or from the IRS
web site at www.irs.gov.

 

If you do not have a TIN, write "Applied For" in the space for the TIN, sign
and date the Substitute Form W-9 and Certification of Awaiting Taxpayer
Identification Number, and give it to the requester. For interest and dividend
payments and certain payments made with respect to readily tradable
instruments, you will generally have 60 days to get a TIN and give it to
the requester before you are subject to backup withholding on payments. The
60-day rule does not apply to other types of payments. You will be subject to
backup withholding on all such payments until you provide your TIN to the
requester.

 

Note: Entering "Applied For" means that you have already applied for a TIN or
that you intend to apply for one soon. 

CAUTION: A disregarded domestic entity that has a foreign owner must use the
appropriate Form W-8.

 

Payees Exempt from Backup Withholding

Individuals (including sole proprietors) are NOT exempt from backup
withholding. Corporations are exempt from backup withholding for certain
payments, such as interest and dividends.

 

Note: If you are exempt from backup withholding, you should still complete
Substitute Form W-9 to avoid possible erroneous backup withholding. If you
are a nonresident alien or a foreign entity not subject

  

 to backup withholding, give the requester the appropriate completed Form
W-8, Certificate of Foreign Status.

The following is a list of payees that may be exempt from backup withholding
and for which no information reporting is required. For interest and
dividends, all listed payees are exempt except for those listed in item (9).
For broker transactions, payees listed in (1) through (13) and any person
registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who regularly acts as a
broker are exempt. Payments subject to reporting under sections 6041 and
6041A are generally exempt from backup withholding only if made to payees
described in items (1) through (7). However, the following payments made to a
corporation (including gross proceeds paid to an attorney under section
6045(f), even if the attorney is a corporation) and reportable on Form
1099-MISC are not exempt from backup withholding: (i) medical and health care
payments, (ii) attorneys fees, and (iii) payments for services paid by a
federal executive agency. Only payees described in items (1) through (5) are
exempt from backup withholding for barter exchange transactions and patronage
dividends.

Payments Exempt from Backup Withholding

Certain payments that are not subject to information reporting are also not
subject to backup withholding. For details, see sections 6041, 6041A, 6042,
6044, 6045, 6049, 6050A and 6050N, and their regulations. The following
payments are not generally subject to backup withholding:

Dividends and Patronage Payments

 



     |  |  |

Payments to nonresident aliens subject to withholding under section 1441. 

---|---|---|--- 
     |  |  |

Payments to partnerships not engaged in a trade or business in the United
States and that have at least one nonresident alien partner.

Payments made by certain foreign organizations. 

---|---|---|--- 
     |  |  |

Section 404(k) distributions made by an ESOP.  

---|---|---|--- 

 

Interest Payments

 



     |  |  |

Payments of interest on obligations issued by individuals. Note: You are
subject to backup withholding if this interest is $600 or more and is paid in
the course of the payers trade or business. Backup withholding applies to the
reportable payment if the payee has not provided a TIN or provided an
incorrect TIN. 

---|---|---|--- 
     |  |  |

Payments described in section 6049(b)(5) to nonresident aliens.

     |  |  |

Payments made by certain foreign organizations. 

---|---|---|--- 
     |  |  |

Mortgage or student loan interest paid to you. 

---|---|---|--- 

_Privacy Act Notice._ Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code requires you
to give your correct TIN to persons who must file information returns with the
IRS to report interest, dividends, and certain other income paid to you,
mortgage interest you paid, the acquisition or abandonment of secured
property, cancellation of debt, or contributions you made to an IRA or Archer
MSA or HSA. The IRS uses the numbers for identification purposes and to help
verify the accuracy of your tax return. The IRS may also provide this
information to the Department of Justice for civil and criminal litigation and
to cities, states, and the District of Columbia to carry out their tax laws.
The IRS may also disclose this information to other countries under a tax
treaty, or to federal and state agencies to enforce federal nontax criminal
laws and to combat terrorism.

 

You must provide your TIN whether or not you are required to file a tax
return. Payers must generally withhold 28% of taxable interest, dividends,
and certain other payments to a payee who does not give a TIN to a payer. The
penalties described below may also apply.

Updating Your Information

You must provide updated information to any person to whom you claimed to be
an exempt payee if you are no longer an exempt payee and anticipate receiving
reportable payments in the future from this person. For example, you may need
to provide updated information if you are a C corporation that elects to be
an S corporation, or if you no longer are tax exempt. In addition, you must
furnish a new Form W-9 if the name or TIN changes for the account, for
example, if the grantor of a grantor trust dies.

 

Penalties

 

Failure to Furnish TIN. If you fail to furnish your correct TIN to a payer,
you are subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure
is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.

Civil Penalty for False Information With Respect to Withholding. If you make
a false statement with no reasonable basis which results in no imposition of
backup withholding, you are subject to a penalty of $500.

Criminal Penalty for Falsifying Information. Willfully falsifying
certifications or affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including
fines and/or imprisonment.

 

Misuse of TINs. If the payer discloses or uses TINs in violation of federal
law, the payer may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.

Definitions

Beneficial owner. For payments other than those for which a reduced rate
of withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty, the beneficial owner of
income is generally the person who is required under U.S. tax principles
to include the income in gross income on a tax return. A person is not a
beneficial owner of income, however, to the extent that person is receiving
the income as a nominee, agent, or custodian, or to the extent the person is a
conduit whose participation in a transaction is disregarded. In the case of
amounts paid that do not constitute income, beneficial ownership is determined
as if the payment were income. Foreign partnerships, foreign simple trusts,
and foreign grantor trusts are not the beneficial owners of income paid to
the partnership or trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign
partnership are generally the partners in the partnership, provided that the
partner is not itself a partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee
or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign simple trust
(that is, a foreign trust that is described in section 651(a)) are generally
the beneficiaries of the trust, if the beneficiary is not a
foreign partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee or other agent.
The beneficial owners of a foreign grantor trust (that is, a foreign trust to
the extent that all or a portion of the income of the trust is treated as
owned by the grantor or another person under sections 671 through 679) are
the persons treated as the owners of the trust. The beneficial owners of
income paid to a foreign complex trust (that is, a foreign trust that is not a
foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust) is the trust itself. The
beneficial owner of income paid to a foreign estate is the estate itself.

__Note: _A payment to a U.S. partnership, U.S. trust, or U.S. estate is
treated as a payment to a U.S. payee that is not subject to 30% foreign-person
withholding. A U.S. partnership, trust, or estate should provide the
withholding agent with a Form W-9. For purposes of section 1446, a U.S.
grantor trust or disregarded entity shall not provide the withholding agent a
Form W-9 in its own right. Rather, the grantor or other owner shall provide
the withholding agent the appropriate form._

 

Foreign person. A foreign person includes a nonresident alien individual, a
foreign corporation, a foreign partnership, a foreign trust, a foreign
estate, and any other person that is not a U.S. person. It also includes a
foreign branch or office of a U.S. financial institution or U.S. clearing
organization if the foreign branch is a qualified intermediary. Generally,
a payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign person is a payment to a foreign
person.

Nonresident alien individual. Any individual who is not a citizen or
resident of the United States is a nonresident alien individual. An alien
individual meeting either the "green card test" or the "substantial presence
test" for the calendar year is a resident alien. Any person not meeting
either test is a nonresident alien individual. Additionally, an alien
individual who is a resident of a foreign country under the residence article
of an income tax treaty, or an alien individual who is a resident of Puerto
Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin
Islands, or American Samoa is a nonresident alien individual. See Pub. 519,
U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens, for more information on resident and nonresident
alien status. 

__Note: _Even though a nonresident alien individual married to a U.S.
citizen or resident alien may choose to be treated as a resident alien for
certain purposes (for example, filing a joint income tax return), such
individual is still treated as a nonresident alien for withholding tax
purposes on all income except wages._

 

Flow-through entity. A flow-through entity is a foreign partnership (other
than a withholding foreign partnership), a foreign simple or foreign grantor
trust (other than a withholding foreign trust), or, for payments for which a
reduced rate of withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty, any entity
to the extent the entity is considered to be fiscally transparent (see
below) with respect to the payment by an interest holders jurisdiction.

For purposes of section 1446, a foreign partnership or foreign grantor trust
must submit Form W-8IMY to establish the partnership or grantor trust as a
look through entity. The Form W-8IMY may be accompanied by this form or
another version of Form W-8 or Form W-9 to establish the foreign or domestic
status of a partner or grantor or other owner. See Regulations section
1.1446-1.

Hybrid entity. A hybrid entity is any person (other than an individual) that
is treated as fiscally transparent (see below) in the United States but is not
treated as fiscally transparent by a country with which the United States has
an income tax treaty. Hybrid entity status is relevant for claiming
treaty benefits. Reverse hybrid entity. A reverse hybrid entity is any person (other than an
individual) that is not fiscally transparent under U.S. tax law principles
but that is fiscally transparent under the laws of a jurisdiction with which
the United States has an income tax treaty.

Fiscally transparent entity. An entity is treated as fiscally transparent
with respect to an item of income for which treaty benefits are claimed to the
extent that the interest holders in the entity must, on a current basis, take
into account separately their shares of an item of income paid to the entity,
whether or not distributed, and must determine the character of the items of
income as if they were realized directly from the sources from which realized
by the entity. For example, partnerships, common trust funds, and simple
trusts or grantor trusts are generally considered to be fiscally transparent
with respect to items of income received by them.

 

Disregarded entity. A business entity that has a single owner and is not a
corporation under Regulations section 301.7701-2(b) is disregarded as an
entity separate from its owner.

A disregarded entity shall not submit this form to a partnership for purposes
of section 1446. Instead, the owner of such entity shall provide appropriate
documentation. See Regulations section 1.1446-1.

Amounts subject to withholding. Generally, an amount subject to withholding
is an amount from sources within the United States that is fixed or
determinable annual or periodical (FDAP) income. FDAP income is all income
included in gross income, including interest (as well as OID), dividends,
rents, royalties, and compensation. FDAP income does not include most gains
from the sale of property (including market discount and option premiums).

 

For purposes of section 1446, the amount subject to withholding is the foreign
partners share of the partnerships effectively connected taxable income.

Withholding agent. Any person, U.S. or foreign, that has control, receipt, or
custody of an amount subject to withholding or who can disburse or make
payments of an amount subject to withholding is a withholding agent. The
withholding agent may be an individual, corporation, partnership, trust,
association, or any other entity, including (but not limited to) any foreign
intermediary, foreign partnership, and U.S. branches of certain foreign banks
and insurance companies. Generally, the person who pays (or causes to be paid)
the amount subject to withholding to the foreign person (or to its
agent) must withhold.

For purposes of section 1446, the withholding agent is the partnership
conducting the trade or business in the United States. For a publicly traded
partnership, the withholding agent may be the partnership, a nominee holding
an interest on behalf of a foreign person, or both. See Regulations section
1.1446-1 through 1.446-6.

 

Specific Instructions

Part I 

Line 4. Your permanent residence address is the address in the country where
you claim to be a resident for purposes of that countrys income tax. If you
are giving Form W-8BEN to claim a reduced rate of withholding under an income
tax treaty, you must determine your residency in the manner required by the
treaty. Do not show the address of a financial institution, a post office
box, or an address used solely for mailing purposes. If you are an individual
who does not have a tax residence in any country, your permanent residence is
where you normally reside. If you are not an individual and you do not have a
tax residence in any country, the permanent residence address is where you
maintain your principal office. ANNEX I

FIFTH: All corporate powers of the Corporation shall be exercised by or under
the direction of the Board of Directors except as otherwise provided herein
or by applicable law. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers
conferred by law, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized:

(i) to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws of the Corporation, subject to the
right of the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote with respect
thereto to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws made by the Board of Directors; and

(ii) from time to time to determine whether and to what extent, at
what time and place, and under what conditions and regulations the accounts

or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by
reason of the fact that such person or a person of whom such person is a legal
representative is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation or for its benefit as a
director, officer, employee or agent of any other corporation, or as the
representative of the Corporation in a partnership, joint venture, trust or
other entity, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the
fullest extent legally permissible under the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware, as amended from time to time, against all
expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines
and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably paid or incurred by
such person in connection therewith. Such right of indemnification shall be a
contract right that may be enforced in any manner desired by such person.
Such right of indemnification shall include the right to be paid by the
Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such action, suit or
proceeding in advance of its final disposition upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if ultimately it should be
determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. If a
claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses hereunder is not paid in
full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been
received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring
suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim, and
if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall also be entitled to be
paid the expenses of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such
action that such indemnification or advancement of costs of defense are not
permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, but the
burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the
failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or any committee
thereof, independent legal counsel, or stockholders) to have made its
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification
of, or advancement of costs of defense to, the claimant is permissible in the
circumstances nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its
Board of Directors or any committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or
stockholders) that such indemnification or advancement is not permissible.
In the event of the death of any person having a right of indemnification
under the foregoing provisions, such right shall inure to the benefit of his
or her heirs, executors, administrators, and personal representatives. Such
right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other right which such
directors, officers or representatives may have or hereafter acquire and,
without limiting the generality of such statement, they shall be entitled to
their respective rights of indemnification under any Bylaw, agreement, vote
of stockholders, provision of law or otherwise, as well as their rights under
this Article.

 

B. The Board of Directors may adopt Bylaws from time to time with
respect to indemnification to provide at all times the fullest
indemnification permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, as amended from time to time, and may cause the Corporation to
purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving
at the request of the Corporation

 



A-2   or for its benefit as a director, officer, employee or agent of any other
corporation, or as the representative of the Corporation in a partnership,
joint venture, trust or other entity, against any expense, liability or loss
asserted against or incurred by any such person in any such capacity or
arising out of any such status, whether or not the Corporation would have the
power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss.

EIGHTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provision contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation in the
manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon
stockholders, directors and officers herein are granted subject to this
reservation; provided that any repeal or amendment of Article Seventh shall
be prospective only and shall not limit the rights of any such director or
officer or the obligations of the Corporation with respect to any claim
arising from or related to the services of such director or officer in any
of the foregoing capacities prior to any such repeal or amendment to Article
Seventh.

NINTH: The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and
exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf
of the Corporation, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary
duty owed by any director or officer of the Corporation to the Corporation or
the Corporations stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim against the
Corporation arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware, this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the
Bylaws of the Corporation or (d) any action asserting a claim against the
Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine, as applied by the
courts of the State of Delaware to corporations organized and existing under
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

_Stockholders_

 

Section 1.1. _Annual Meetings_. An annual meeting of stockholders
shall be held for the election of directors at such date, time and place
either within or without the State of Delaware as may be designated by the
Board of Directors from time to time. Any other proper business may be
transacted at the annual meeting.

Section 1.2. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of stockholders
may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, if any, the Vice
Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or the Board of Directors, to be
held at such date, time and place either within or without the State of
Delaware as may be stated in the notice of the meeting.

Section 1.3.  _Notice of Meetings_. Whenever stockholders are
required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the
meeting shall be given which shall state the place, date and hour of the
meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for
which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law, the written
notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten nor more than sixty
days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at
such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the
stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.

Section 1.4.  _Adjournments_. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or
special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other
place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time
and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is
fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

 

Section 1.5. _Quorum_. At each meeting of stockholders, except where
otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws,
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of each class of stock
entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum. For purposes of the foregoing, two or more classes
or series of stock shall be considered a single class if the holders thereof
are entitled to vote together as a single class at the meeting. In the absence
of a quorum, the stockholders so present may, by majority vote, adjourn the
meeting from time to time in the manner provided by Section 1.4 of these
bylaws until a quorum shall attend. Shares of its own capital stock belonging
on the record date for   the meeting to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of
the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other
corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall
neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation to
vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in
a fiduciary capacity.

Section 1.6.   _Organization_. Meetings of stockholders shall be
presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the
Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the President, or in
his absence by a Vice President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons
by a chairman designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such
designation by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall act as
secretary of the meeting, but in his absence the chairman of the meeting may
appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

Section 1.7. _Voting; Proxies_. Unless otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting
of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by
him which has voting power upon the matter in question. Each stockholder
entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent
to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person
or persons to act for him by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted
upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer
period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it
is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke
any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in
person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another
duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the Secretary of the
Corporation. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot
and need not be conducted by inspectors unless the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of all classes of stock entitled to vote thereon
present in person or by proxy at such meeting shall so determine. At all
meetings of stockholders for the election of directors, a plurality of
the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. All other elections and
questions shall, unless otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of
Incorporation or these bylaws, be decided by the vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of all classes of stock entitled to vote
thereon present in person or by proxy at the meeting, provided that (except as
otherwise required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation) the Board of
Directors may require a larger vote upon any election or question.

Section 1.8. _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of
Record_. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any
adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other
distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in
respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose
of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a
record date, which shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before
the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty days prior to any other action.
If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given,
or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding
the day on which the meeting is held; (2) the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is necessary, shall be
the day on which the first written consent is expressed; and (3) the record
date for determining

 



2  stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination
of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however,
that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

 

Section 1.9. _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The Secretary
shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of
each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder,
for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a
period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within
the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in
the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the
meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time
and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by
any stockholder who is present.

Section 1.10. _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_. Unless
otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required
by law to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting
of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken,
shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present
and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a
meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those
stockholders who have not consented in writing. 

ARTICLE II

Section 2.1. _Powers; Number; Qualifications_. The business and
affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by the Board of Directors, except
as may be otherwise provided by law or in the Certificate of Incorporation.

Section 2.2. _Election; Term of Office; Resignation;
Removal; Vacancies_. Each director shall hold office until the annual
meeting of stockholders next succeeding his election and until his successor

or to the President or the Secretary of the Corporation. Such resignation
shall take effect at the time specified therein, and unless otherwise
specified therein no acceptance of such resignation shall be necessary to
make it effective. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation or these bylaws, vacancies and newly created directorships
resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or from any
other cause may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office,
although less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director.

 



3 Section 2.3. _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of
Directors may be held at such places within or without the State of Delaware
and at such times as the Board may from time to time determine, and if so
determined, notice thereof need not be given.

Directors may be held at any time or place within or without the State of
Delaware whenever called by the Chairman of the Board, if any, by the Vice
Chairman of the Board, if any, by the President or by any two directors.
Reasonable notice thereof shall be given by the person or persons calling the
meeting.

Section 2.5. _Telephonic Meetings Permitted_. Unless otherwise
restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, members
of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board, may
participate in a meeting of the Board or of such committee, as the case may
be, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by
means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other,
and participation in a meeting pursuant to this by law shall constitute
presence in person at such meeting.

Section 2.6. _Quorum; Vote Required for Action_. At all meetings of
the Board of Directors one third of the entire Board shall constitute
a quorum for the transaction of business. The vote of a majority of the
directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act
of the Board unless the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws shall
require a vote of a greater number. In case at any meeting of the Board a
quorum shall not be present, the members of the Board present may adjourn the
meeting from time to time until a quorum shall attend.

 

Section 2.7. _Organization_. Meetings of the Board of Directors
shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence
by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his absence by the President,
or in their absence by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall
act as secretary of the meeting, but in his absence the chairman of the
meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

Section 2.8. _Informal Action by Directors_. Unless otherwise
restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, any
action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of
Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all
members of the Board or of such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto
in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of
proceedings of the Board or committee.

ARTICLE III

 

 _Committees_

Section 3.1. _Committees_. The Board of Directors may designate one
or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors
of the Corporation. The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate
members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at
any meeting of the committee. The bylaws may provide that in the absence
or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members present
at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or
members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the
board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or
disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the
resolution of the board of directors, or in the bylaws of the

 



4  Corporation, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the
Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the
Corporation; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in
reference to the following matter: (i) approving or adopting, or recommending
to the stockholders, any action or matter expressly required by these bylaws
to be submitted to stockholders for approval or (ii) adopting, amending or
repealing any bylaw of the Corporation.

Section 3.2. _Committee Rules_. Unless the Board of Directors
otherwise provides, each committee designated by the Board may make, alter and
repeal rules for the conduct of its business. In the absence of a provision
by the Board or a provision in the rules of such committee to the contrary, a
majority of the entire authorized number of members of such committee shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, the vote of a majority
of the members present at a meeting at the time of such vote if a quorum is
then present shall be the act of such committee, and in other respects each
committee shall conduct its business in the same manner as the Board conducts
its business pursuant to Article II of these bylaws.

ARTICLE IV

 

 _Officers_

Section 4.1. _Officers; Election; Qualification; Term of Office;
Resignation; Removal; Vacancies_. As soon as practicable after the
annual meeting of stockholders in each year, the Board of Directors shall
elect a President and a Secretary, and it may, if it so determines, elect from
among its members a Chairman of the Board and a Vice Chairman of the Board.
The Board may also elect one or more Vice Presidents, one or more Assistant
Vice Presidents, one or more Assistant Secretaries, a Treasurer and one or
more Assistant Treasurers and may give any of them such further designations
or alternate titles as it considers desirable. Each such officer shall hold
office until the first meeting of the Board after the annual meeting of
stockholders next succeeding his election, and until his successor is elected
and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal. Any officer may
resign at any time upon written notice to the Board or to the President or the
Secretary of the Corporation. Such resignation shall take effect at the time
specified therein, and unless otherwise specified therein no acceptance of
such resignation shall be necessary to make it effective. The Board may
remove any officer with or without cause at any time. Any such removal shall
be without prejudice to the contractual rights of such officer, if any, with
the Corporation, but the election or appointment of an officer shall not of
itself create contractual rights. Any number of offices may be held by the
same person. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Corporation by death,
resignation, removal or otherwise may be filled for the unexpired portion of
the term by the Board at any regular or special meeting.

Section 4.2. _Powers and Duties of Executive Officers_. The
officers of the Corporation shall have such powers and duties in the
management of the Corporation as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors
and, to the extent not so provided, as generally pertain to their respective

officer, agent or employee to give security for the faithful performance of
his duties.

Section 5.1. _Certificates_. Every holder of stock in the
Corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by or in the name
of the Corporation by the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors,
if any, or the President or a Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an
Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, of the
Corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by him in the Corporation.
If such certificate is manually signed by one officer or manually
countersigned by a transfer agent or by a registrar, any other signature on
the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or
registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a
certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar
before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with
the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the
date of issue.

 

Section 5.2. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Stock Certificates; Issuance
of New Certificates_. The Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock in
the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may require the owner of the
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give
the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may
be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any
such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.

and Committees_. Whenever notice is required to be given by law or under any
provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, a written
waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or
after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.
Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of
such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express
purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of
any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither
the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special
meeting of the stockholders, directors, or members of a committee of
directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required
by the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws.

 

Section 6.4. _Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees_.
The Corporation shall have power to indemnify to the full extent authorized by
law any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action, suit or
proceeding, whether criminal, civil, 

 



6  administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he, his testator
or intestate is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation or
any predecessor of the Corporation or serves or served any other enterprise
as a director, officer or employee at the request of the Corporation or any
predecessor of the Corporation.

Section 6.5. _Interested Directors; Quorum_. No contract or
transaction between the Corporation and one or more of its directors
or officers, or between the Corporation and any other corporation,
partnership, association or other organization in which one or more of its
directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a financial interest,
shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the
director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board
of Directors or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or
transaction, or solely because his or their votes are counted for such
purpose, if: (1) the material facts as to his relationship or interest and as
to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board or the
committee, and the Board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract
or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested
directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or
(2) the material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders
entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically
approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (3) the contract or
transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is authorized,
approved or ratified, by the Board, a committee thereof or the stockholders.
Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a
quorum at a meeting of the Board or of a committee which authorizes the
contract or transaction.

Section 6.6. _Form of Records_. Any records maintained by the
Corporation in the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger,
books of account and minute books, may be kept on, or be in the form of,
punch cards, magnetic tape, photographs, microphotographs or any other
information storage device, provided that the records so kept can be converted
into clearly legible form within a reasonable time. The Corporation shall
so convert any records so kept upon the request of any person entitled to
inspect the same.

Section 6.7. _Amendment of Bylaws_. These bylaws may be altered or
repealed, and new bylaws made, by the Board of Directors, but the stockholders
may make additional bylaws and may alter or repeal any by law whether or not
adopted by them.
