2.10   _Earn-Out Payment_.

  

(a)   _Earn-Out Payment_. As Merger Consideration, at the time
provided in _Section 2.10(b)_ , Parent (or its designee so long as Parent
remains an obligor thereof) shall pay to the Applicable Holders, in proportion
to their respective Unpaid Pro Rata Portions, an amount, if any, equal to,
the Earn-Out Base Amount _minus_ the Key Man Retention Bonus Amount (the "
_Earn-Out Payment_ ").

  

(b)   _Determination of Earn-Out Base Amount and Earn-Out
Payment_. No later than 60 days after the end of the Calculation Period (the
" _Earn-Out Payment Calculation Date_ "), Parent shall prepare and deliver to
Representative a written statement (the " _Earn-Out Payment Calculation
Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail Parent's determination of
Adjusted EBITDA for the Calculation Period and its calculation of the
resulting Earn-Out Base Amount, Key Man Retention Bonus Amount and the Earn-
Out Payment (the " _Earn-Out Payment Calculation_ ").

  

(c)   _Timing and Manner of Payment of Earn-Out Payment_. On
the 15th day following the Earn-Out Payment Calculation Date (the " _Earn-Out
Payment Date_ "), Parent shall pay the Earn-Out Payment and the Key Man
Retention Bonus Amount, if any, as determined by Parent pursuant to _Section
2.10(b)_ , as follows:

  

  (i)   _Escrow Deposit_. Parent shall deposit an amount in cash equal to 10% of the Earn-Out Base Amount, if any, as determined by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_ (the " _Contingent Escrow Amount_ "), with the Escrow Agent to be held as part of the Escrow Fund and to be disbursed in accordance with _Section 2.17_ and the Escrow Agreement;

  

  (ii)   _Key Man Retention Bonus Amount_. Parent shall fund and pay to the recipients of the Key Man Retention Bonus Awards the Key Man Retention Bonus Amount among them in accordance with the terms of the Key Retention Man Bonus Awards agreement entered into with each participant;

  

  (iii)   _Earn-Out Payment Shares_. Parent shall pay up to $5,000,000 of the Earn-Out Base Amount, if any, payable pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_ remaining after payment of the Contingent Escrow Amount and the Key Man Retention Bonus Amount (the " _Distributable Earn-Out Payment_ ") by issuing shares of Parent's common stock, par value $0.001 per share (" _Earn-Out Payment Shares_ "), to Applicable Holders who are Eligible Applicable Holders in their respective Earn-Out Share Portions with all other Applicable Holders receiving their respective Unpaid Pro Rata Portions of the Distributable Earn-Out Payment in cash pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)(iv)_. If the Distributable Earn-Out Payment is not enough for Parent to issue $5,000,000 of Earn-Out Payment Shares to the Applicable Holders who are Eligible Applicable Holders, the dollar amount of Earn-Out Payment Shares to be issued by Parent shall be reduced to the maximum dollar amount issuable under the circumstances. The Earn-Out Payment Shares will be restricted stock under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and will be issued only to Eligible Applicable Holders. Resales of Earn-Out Payment Shares will be governed by applicable Law, including without limitation, Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and will be subject to additional restrictions on trading volume during the six-month period after the Earn-Out Payment Shares, pursuant to the Lock-up Agreements. The number of Earn-Out Payment Shares Parent shall issue will be equal to the quotient of (i) the lesser of (x) $5,000,000, or (y) the maximum aggregate amount of the Earn-Out Payment payable by issuance of Earn-Out Payment Shares, divided by (ii) the closing bid price of Earn-Out Payment Shares, as reported by Bloomberg Finance, L.P., on the trading day immediately preceding the public announcement of the Merger.

   



 



    

  

  (iv)   _Cash Payment_. Parent shall pay to the Applicable Holders the remainder of the Earn-Out Payment payable, if any, as determined by Parent pursuant to _Sections 2.10(b)_ and _2.10(d)_ that is not paid by issuance of Earn-Out Payment Shares pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)(iii)_ , in cash as follows:

  

(A)  To each Applicable Shareholder who is an Eligible Applicable
Holder and who has received Earn-Out Payment Shares pursuant to _Section
2.10(c)(iii)_ , an amount equal to (i) such Eligible Applicable Holder's Pro
Rata Portion of the Distributable Earn-Out Payment, _minus_ (ii) the dollar
amount of the Earn-Out Payment Shares issued to such Eligible Applicable
Shareholder pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)(iii)_ ; and

  

(B)  To each other Applicable Holder, an amount equal to such
Applicable Holder's Pro Rata Portion of the Distributable Earn-Out Payment.

  

(d)   _Dispute Resolution_. The Representative shall have 60
days after the Earn-Out Payment Date (the " _Review Period_ ") to review the
Earn-Out Payment Calculation Statement and the Earn-Out Payment Calculation
set forth therein. During the Review Period, the Representative and his
representatives shall have the right to inspect Parent's and the Company's
books and records during normal business hours at Parent's and the Surviving
Corporation's offices, upon reasonable prior notice and solely for purposes
reasonably related to the determination of Adjusted EBITDA for the Calculation
Period and the resulting Earn-Out Payment amount. At any time before the
expiration of the Review Period, Representative may object to the Earn-Out
Payment Calculation set forth in the Earn-Out Payment Calculation Statement
for the Calculation Period by delivering a written notice of objection (a "
_Earn-Out Payment Calculation Objection Notice_ ") to Parent. Any Earn-Out
Payment Calculation Objection Notice shall specify the items in the Earn-Out
Payment Calculation disputed by the Representative and shall describe in
reasonable detail the basis for such objection, as well as the amount in
dispute. If the Representative fails to deliver a Earn-Out
Payment Calculation Objection Notice to Parent before the expiration of the
Review Period, then the Earn-Out Payment Calculation set forth in the Earn-
Out Payment Calculation Statement shall be final and binding on the Parties.
If the Representative timely delivers a Earn-Out Payment Calculation
Objection Notice, Parent and the Representative shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve the disputed items and agree upon the resulting amount of Adjusted
EBITDA and the Earn-Out Payment for the Calculation Period. If Parent and the
Representative are unable to reach agreement within 30 days after such a Earn-
Out Payment Calculation Objection Notice has been given, all unresolved
disputed items shall be promptly referred to the Neutral Accountant. The
Neutral Accountant shall be directed to render a written report on the
unresolved disputed items with respect to the applicable Earn-Out Payment
Calculation as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 60 days
after such submission to the Neutral Accountant, and to resolve only those
unresolved disputed items set forth in the Earn-Out Payment Calculation
Objection Notice. If unresolved disputed items are submitted to the Neutral
Accountant, Parent and the Representative shall each furnish to the Neutral
Accountant such work papers, schedules and other documents and information
relating to the unresolved disputed items as the Neutral Accountant may
reasonably request. The Neutral Accountant shall resolve the disputed items
based solely on the applicable definitions and other terms in this Agreement
and the presentations by Parent and the Representative, and not by independent
review. The resolution of the dispute and the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA
that is the subject of the Earn-Out Payment Calculation Objection Notice by
the Neutral Accountant shall be final and binding on the Parties. The fees
and expenses of the Neutral Accountant shall be borne by the
Representative and Parent in proportion to the amounts by which their
respective calculations of Adjusted EBITDA differ from Adjusted EBITDA
as finally determined by the Neutral Accountant. No later than ten Business
Days after the date upon which the determination of Adjusted EBITDA for the
Calculation Period becomes final and binding upon the Parties as provided in
this _Section 2.10(d)_ (including any final resolution of any dispute raised
by the Representative in a Earn-Out Payment Calculation Objection Notice),
Parent shall pay any additional amount of Earn-Out Payment it is determined
to owe in cash to the Applicable Holders in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Portions.

Business; provided that, during the Calculation Period, the Company (as the
Surviving Corporation) and its Subsidiaries will be operated as separate
subsidiaries of Parent, and provided further, Parent will operate the mophie
Business in good faith and will not act or refrain from acting in any way
primarily intended to result in an unreasonable reduction of Adjusted EBITDA.

  

(f)   _Restricted Activity_. Until (i) the Calculation Period
has expired and (ii) Parent has paid any amounts due under this _Section
2.10_ , Parent shall not be permitted to (A) sell all or substantially all of
the assets of the Surviving Corporation; or (B) sell or transfer to any non-

  (ii)  Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, prepare and file amended Tax Returns for the Company for the applicable tax year and in connection with such filings shall take commercially reasonable actions to obtain the Tax Refund, except that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to take any position in respect of the Tax Refund or the Tax Returns generating the Tax Refund in contravention of the advice of their tax and legal advisers;

  

  (iii)  For avoidance of doubt, the calculation of the NOL Credit excludes any NOLs generated prior to the Effective Time and unused after carryback to the 2013 tax year for federal income and California income Taxes pursuant to clause (y) above of _Section 2.11(a)_ ; and

(a)   _Net Proceeds_. The payment of all or any Contingent
Payments (except for the Earn-Out Payment, as to which none of Parent's or
its Affiliates' expenses or costs incurred in connection therewith shall be
deducted except as set forth in _Section 2.10(d)_ ) shall be net of all out-
of-pocket expenses of Parent or its Affiliates incurred or paid in
connection with the transaction or actions taken by Parent or its Affiliates

prosecution or advancement of such matter, Parent shall, to the extent
permissible under applicable Law, assign the rights of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation in and to such matter to the Representative, to possess and
manage on behalf of all Applicable Holders. If Parent decides to continue the
prosecution or Advancement of such matter upon the Representative's

order has been entered against the Company Indemnitors as to Damages owed to
Parent arising out of a Direct Claim or a Third Party Action.

  

(e)   _No Security_. The contingent right to receive the
Contingent Payments shall not be represented by any form of certificate or
other instrument, is not transferable, except by operation of Laws relating to
descent and distribution, divorce and community property, and does not
constitute an equity or ownership interest in Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company. No Person, including the Representative, shall have any rights as a
securityholder of Parent or the Company as the Surviving Corporation as a
result of a contingent right to receive the Contingent Payments under
_Section 2.10_. No interest is payable with respect to the Earn-Out Payment.

  

(f)   _Non-Payment_. If Parent does not pay any amount when and
as due under _Section 2.10_ or _2.11_ hereof, then interest shall accrue on

payment is due until paid in full.

(b)   _Company Series B Preferred Shares_. Each Company Series B

of the Letter of Transmittal received from each such Optionholder. To
the extent an Option is not an In-the-Money Option as of the Effective Time
and such Optionholder does not execute an Acknowledgement and Release, such
Option shall be cancelled at the Effective Time.

destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in exchange therefor

to which appraisal rights have been properly demanded in accordance with
Sections 1300 to 1313 of the CGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive any portion of the Merger
Consideration at or after the Effective Time, and holders of such Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined
to be due to any such holders of Dissenting Shares pursuant to Sections 1300
to 1313 of the CGCL; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, if any such holder
withdraws his, her or its demand for appraisal rights or becomes ineligible
for appraisal rights, then, as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of
such event, whichever later occurs, such holder's Dissenting Shares shall
cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into and represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Sections 2.13_
and _2.14_. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who pursuant to the provisions
of Sections 1300-1313 of the CGCL becomes entitled to payment thereunder for
such shares, shall receive payment therefore in accordance with Sections
1300-1313 of the CGCL (but only after the value of such Dissenting Shares

2.16   _Adjustment Before and After the Closing_. The Closing
Consideration shall be subject to adjustment as follows:

   



 



    

  

(a)  Not later than three Business Days before the Closing
Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent a statement (the "
_Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth (i) a balance sheet
of the Company estimated in good faith as of the close of business on the
Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, (ii) the estimated
amount of Indebtedness of the Company as of the Effective Time, (iii) the
estimated amount of the Transaction Expenses, (iv) the estimated amount of
the aggregate of all Employee Amounts, (v) the estimated amount of the Payroll
Taxes, (vi) the estimated amount of Closing Net Working Capital (" _Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital_ "), and (vii) a calculation of any adjustment to
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.9_ (the " _Estimated Closing
Adjustment_ ") resulting from (A) the amount by which Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital exceeds the Working Capital Target, or (B) the amount by
which Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Working Capital
Target, together, in each case, with all relevant backup materials, in detail
reasonably acceptable to Parent. The Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement
and the included balance sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied consistently with the Company's past practices (to the extent such
past practices are consistent with GAAP) but in all events in conformity with
_Schedule 2.16(a)_, which reflects the methodologies and items to be
included in the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement, including estimated
amounts in respect thereof as of the date of this Agreement and a sample
balance sheet and Estimated Net Working Capital calculation. From the
delivery of the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement until the Closing
Date, Parent and its accountants shall, upon reasonable notice and during
normal business hours, be permitted to discuss with the Company's Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer and
the Company's accountants the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement and shall
be provided complete and accurate copies of, and have reasonable access upon
reasonable notice at reasonable times during normal business hours to the
work papers and supporting records of the Company and its accountants so as to
allow Parent and its accountants to verify the accuracy of the Estimated
Closing Adjustment Statement. If within two Business Days following Parent's
receipt of the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement, Parent has not given
the Company notice of its objection thereto, the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital shall be as set forth in the Estimated Closing Adjustment
Statement delivered to Parent by the Company. If Parent gives such notice of
objection, the Company and Parent will work together in good faith to resolve
the issues in dispute. If all disputed issues are resolved, the amounts as
agreed upon by Parent and the Company shall be used to determine the
Estimated Closing Adjustment. If Parent and the Company are unable to resolve
all such disputed issues within three Business Days following Parent's
delivery of written notice of objection, the Estimated Closing Adjustment
shall be as determined by an average of Company's and Parent's position.

  

(b)  Not later than 120 days after the Closing Date, Parent
shall deliver to the Representative a statement (the " _Closing Adjustment
Statement_ "), including (i) a balance sheet of the Company as of the close of
business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, (ii) the
amount of Indebtedness of the Company as of the Effective Time, (iii)
the amount of the Transaction Expenses, (iv) the aggregate of all Employee
Amounts payable in connection with the Closing transactions, (v) the amount
of the Payroll Taxes, (vi) the amount of Closing Net Working Capital (" _Final
Closing Net Working Capital_ "), and (vii) a calculation of (A) the amount by
which Final Closing Net Working Capital exceeds Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital, or (B) the amount by which Final Closing Net Working Capital is less
than Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, together, in each case, with all
relevant backup materials, in reasonable detail. The Closing Adjustment
Statement and such balance sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied consistently with the Company's past practices (to the extent such
past practices are consistent with GAAP), but in all events consistent with
_Schedule 2.16(a)_.

   



 



    

  

(c)  From the delivery of the Closing Adjustment Statement
until such time as the calculation of the Final Closing Net Working Capital
has been finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.16_, the
Representative and his accountants shall, upon reasonable notice and during
normal business hours, be permitted to discuss with Parent and its accountants
the Closing Adjustment Statement and shall be provided complete and accurate
copies of, and have reasonable access (including electronic access, to
the extent reasonably available) upon reasonable notice at reasonable times
during normal business hours to the work papers and supporting records of
Parent and its accountants so as to allow the Representative and his
accountants to verify the accuracy of the Closing Adjustment Statement.

  

(d)  If the Representative disputes the Closing Adjustment
Statement, the Representative shall notify Parent in writing (the " _Dispute
Notice_ ") of the amount, nature and basis of such dispute, within 30 days
after delivery of the Closing Adjustment Statement. Any such Dispute Notice
shall specify those items or amounts as to which the Representative disagrees,
and the Representative and Parent shall be deemed to have agreed with all
other items and amounts contained in the Closing Adjustment Statement and not
raised in the Dispute Notice. If Parent and the Representative are unable to
resolve the dispute within 30 days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, then
any remaining items in dispute shall be submitted to the Neutral Accountant,
provided that if the Neutral Accountant declines to be engaged Representative
and Parent shall select a substitute national or regional independent
accounting firm, or, if the Representative and Parent fail or refuse to select
a firm within 10 days after written request therefor by the Representative or
Parent, such an independent national or regional accounting firm shall be
selected in accordance with the rules of the Fresno, California office of the
American Arbitration Association, which substitute independent accounting

consider only those items in the Closing Adjustment Statement as to which the
Representative has disagreed, shall be in writing and shall be delivered to
Parent and the Representative as promptly as practicable. The

shall be within the range of the values in dispute and be binding and
conclusive upon all Parties. A judgment on the determination made by the
Neutral Accountant pursuant to this _Section 2.16(d)_ may be entered in and
enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction.

  

(e)  The fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant in
connection with the resolution of disputes pursuant to _Section
2.16(d)_ shall be borne by the Applicable Holders, on the one hand, and
Parent, on the other hand, in proportion to the amounts by which the
proposals of Parent and the Representative submitted to the Neutral Accountant
differed from the Neutral Accountant's final determination.

   



 



    

  

(f)  Upon the expiration of the 30-day period for giving the
Dispute Notice, if no such notice is given, or upon notification by the
Representative to Parent, that no such notice will be given, or upon the
resolution of disputes, if any, pursuant to this  _Section 2.16_:

  

  (i)  If the Final Closing Net Working Capital is less than Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, Parent shall be entitled to recover such deficiency pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement;

  

  (ii)  If the Final Closing Net Working Capital is equal to Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, no adjustment to the Merger Consideration shall be made; and

  

  (iii)  If the Final Closing Net Working Capital exceeds Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent for distribution to Applicable Holders, in proportion to their respective Unpaid Pro Rata Portion, as Merger Consideration, in immediately available funds an amount equal to the amount of such surplus (the " _Closing Adjustment Surplus_ ").

  

(g)  The Parties agree that the purpose of this _Section 2.16_
is to measure changes in the items contained in the Closing Adjustment
Statement and such processes are not intended to permit the introduction of
different judgments, accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures,
classifications or estimation methodologies for the purpose of determining
such items.

(a)   _Escrow Fund_. On the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver
to the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount and on the Earn-Out Payment Date,
Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent the Contingent Escrow (together with
the Escrow Amount and any amounts deposited with the Escrow Agent after the
Closing date pursuant to _Section 2.16(f)(iii)_, the " _Escrow Fund_ "). The
Escrow Fund shall be held by the Escrow Agent for the purposes of (i)
providing security for any adjustment to the amount of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.16_, (ii) providing security for any
liability for Taxes arising from the Audit Notice; and (iii) securing and
initially paying the indemnification obligations of the Company Indemnitors
set forth in _Article 9_. The Escrow Fund shall be held by the Escrow Agent
as a trust fund and shall not be subject to any Lien, attachment, trustee
process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any party, and shall
be held and disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement and the following terms:

  

  (i)  Within ten (10) days of the Audit Completion Date, the Parties shall deliver joint written instructions signed by Parent and the Representative, directing the Escrow Agent to release by wire transfer or otherwise distribute, from the then remaining Escrow Fund, an amount equal to $1,000,000 to: (i) Parent to the extent, if at all, the Surviving Corporation incurs any Tax liability arising from the Audit Notice as of the Audit Completion Date and (ii) the balance to the Exchange Agent to be distributed to the Applicable Holders. For avoidance of doubt, _Article 7_ shall govern the control of the Tax audit contemplated by the Audit Notice.

   



 



    

  

  (ii)  The Parties shall deliver joint written instructions signed by Parent and the Representative promptly after the date 18 months following the Closing Date (the " _Scheduled Distribution Date_ "), directing the Escrow Agent to release by wire transfer or otherwise distribute, from the then remaining Escrow Fund, an amount equal to (i) the remaining balance of the Escrow Fund, _less_ (ii) the amount of all Unresolved Claims as of the Scheduled Distribution Date, it being understood that if the foregoing calculation results in a negative amount, Parent and the Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to make no distribution (such amount, the " _Distribution Amount_ "), in accordance with this _Section 2.17(a)(i)_. " _Unresolved Claims_ " means, as of a specified date, the aggregate amount of all indemnification claims that are the subject of a Direct Claim or a Third Party Action, or that are otherwise unsatisfied as of such date, including any indemnification claims for which a notice of a Direct Claim or a Third Party Action has been delivered but for which the 30-day dispute period has not expired as of such date plus $1,000,000 if the Audit Completion Date has not yet occured. Any payment under this _Section 2.17(a)(i)_ shall be by wire transfer of a cash amount equal to the payment amount, pursuant to the wire instructions set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

  

  (iii)  Promptly after (x) the final determination of any Unresolved Claim that is the subject of a dispute notice, which resolution results in amounts due to Parent, (y) the delivery by either Party of a copy of a written notice from the Representative under which Parent is entitled to all or a portion of the claimed amount set forth in a Claim Notice, or (z) the expiration of the 30-day Response period for any Claim Notice submitted by Parent as to which the Representative submits no Response during such 30-day period, the Parties shall deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions signed by Parent and the Representative directing the Escrow Agent to release an amount from the Escrow Fund corresponding to the amounts due to be paid to Parent under any of clauses (x), (y) or (z) above, in the case of a disbursement of cash, by wire transfer of a cash amount equal to the amount of the Unresolved Claim, pursuant to the wire instructions set forth in the Escrow Agreement. Any amounts not otherwise due to Parent shall be paid to Exchange Agent for distribution to the Applicable Holders.

  

(b)   _Representative Expense Fund_. On the Closing Date, Parent
shall pay to the Representative or the Representative's designee the
Representative Expense Fund for the purpose of securing the payment of and
paying any Representative Expenses. The Representative will hold the
Representative Expense Fund separate from his personal funds, will not use
such funds for his personal expenses or any other unauthorized purposes and
will not voluntarily make these funds available to his creditors in the event
of bankruptcy. The Applicable Holders will not receive any interest or other
earnings on the Representative Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and
assign to the Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have
had in any such interest or earnings.

  

  (i)  The Representative is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations or advice. The Representative shall have no responsibility or liability to any Applicable Holder for any loss of principal of the Representative Expense Fund other than as a result of fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Representative. The Representative Expense Fund shall terminate on the date on which all remaining amounts constituting the Escrow Fund have been distributed in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (the " _Representative Period_ ").

   



 



    

  

  (ii)  Upon the expiration of the Representative Period, the remaining amount of cash, if any, constituting the Representative Expense Fund shall be distributed to each Applicable Holder in an amount equal to their respective Pro Rata Portions of the aggregate amount to be returned. For Tax purposes, the Representative Expense Fund will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Applicable Holders at the time of Closing.

  

(c)  The Principal Shareholders, by their execution of this
Agreement, and the other Applicable Holders, by the approval of the Merger
and adoption of this Agreement and/or their acceptance of any consideration
pursuant to this Agreement, hereby approve the Escrow Agreement and of all of
the arrangements relating thereto, including (i) the placement of the Escrow
Fund in the escrow established pursuant to this _Section 2.17_ and (ii) the
delivery of the Representative Expense Fund to the Representative or the
Representative's designee pursuant to this _Section 2.17_.

  

2.18   _Representative_.

  

(a)  In order to efficiently administer the Merger, including
(i) the determination of any adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.16_ and (ii)
the dispute, defense and/or settlement of any claims for which the Company
Indemnitors may be required to indemnify Parent and/or the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to this Agreement, the Principal Shareholders, by their
execution of this Agreement, and the other Applicable Holders, by the
approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement and/or their acceptance
of any consideration pursuant to this Agreement, hereby designate and appoint
the Representative as their representative, attorney-in-fact and agent. This
power of attorney and all authority hereby conferred shall be irrevocable and
shall not be terminated by any act of any Applicable Holder, by operation of
Law, whether by such Applicable Holder's death, disability, protective
supervision or any other event.

  

(b)  The Principal Shareholders, by their execution of this
Agreement, and the other Applicable Holders, by the approval of the Merger
and adoption of this Agreement and/or their acceptance of any consideration
pursuant to this Agreement, hereby authorize the Representative: (i) to make
all decisions relating to the determination of any adjustments pursuant to
_Section 2.16_, (ii) to take all action necessary in connection with the
waiver of any condition to the obligations of the Company and the Applicable
Holders to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, or the dispute,
defense and/or settlement of any claims for which the Applicable Holders may
be required to indemnify Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
_Article 9_, (iii) to give and receive all notices permitted or required to
be given under this Agreement, (iv) to execute and deliver the Escrow
Agreement and (v) to take any and all additional action as is contemplated to
be taken by or on behalf of the Applicable Holders by the terms of this
Agreement.

  

(c)  If the Representative becomes unable to perform his
responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such position, the
Applicable Holders (acting by the vote of the Applicable Holders who
immediately before the Effective Time held the right to receive at least a
majority of the Common Equivalent Merger Consideration) shall select another
representative to fill the vacancy of the Representative initially chosen by
the Applicable Holders, and such substituted representative shall be deemed to
be the Representative for all purposes of this Agreement and the documents
delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

   



 



    

  

(d)  All decisions and actions of the Representative on behalf
of the Applicable Holders shall be deemed to be facts ascertainable outside
of this Agreement and shall be binding upon all Applicable Holders, and no
Applicable Holder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same. A decision, act, consent, instruction or action of
the Representative, including any agreement between the Representative and
Parent relating to the determination of the Final Closing Net Working Capital,
the Merger Consideration or the dispute, defense or settlement of any claims
for which the Applicable Holders may be required to indemnify Parent and/or
the Surviving Corporation pursuant to _Article 9_, shall constitute a
decision, act, consent, instruction or action of all Applicable Holders and
shall be binding and conclusive upon each of such Applicable Holders and the
Parties, the Surviving Corporation and the Escrow Agent may rely upon any
such decision, act, consent, instruction or action as being the
decision, act, consent or instructions of each and every such Applicable
Holder. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Escrow Agent are hereby
relieved from any liability to any Applicable Holder for any acts done by them
in accordance with such decision, act, consent, instruction or action of the
Representative.

  

(e)  The Representative will receive no compensation for
services as the Representative. By his, her or its execution of
this Agreement, each Principal Shareholder, and by their approval of the
Merger and adoption of this Agreement, and/or their acceptance of any
consideration pursuant to this Agreement, each other Applicable Holder, agrees
that the Applicable Holders will pay from the Representative Expense Fund all
(i) professional fees and expenses of any attorney, accountant or other
advisors or expert retained by the Representative and other reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses incurred by the Representative in connection with
the performance of the Representative's duties under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement and (ii) any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims,
penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses actually
incurred or suffered by the Representative in connection with this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement as the Representative (collectively, the "
_Representative Expenses_ ") in each case as such Representative Expense is
suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that if any such Representative Expense is
finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the fraud, gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Representative, the Representative
will reimburse the Applicable Holders the amount of such indemnified
Representative Expense to the extent attributable to such fraud, gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Such Representative Expenses may only be
recovered by the Representative from the Representative Expense Fund or from
the Escrow Fund as provided below or from the Applicable Holders directly. In
no event will the Representative be required to advance his own funds on
behalf of the Applicable Holders or otherwise. Following the resolution of
all pending claims related thereto (and, for the avoidance of doubt, no
earlier), the Representative shall have the right to recover Representative
Expenses in excess of the Representative Expense Fund from the Escrow Fund
before any distribution to the Applicable Holders. By his, her or its
execution of this Agreement, each Principal Shareholder, and by their approval
of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement, and/or their acceptance of any
consideration pursuant to this Agreement, each other Applicable Holder,
agrees that the Applicable Holders will on an individual and several basis
(and not jointly as to or with any other Applicable Holder) indemnify,
defend, hold harmless and reimburse, on a Proceeds Pro Rata Basis, the
Representative for Representative Expenses, in each case as such
Representative Expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity will survive the
resignation or removal of the Representative or the termination of this
Agreement, and the Representative and the Applicable Holders acknowledge and
agree that the provisions of this _Section 2.18(e)_ shall impose no
obligations on the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates.

   



 



    

  

(f)  By his, her or its execution of this Agreement, each
Principal Shareholder, and by their approval of the Merger and adoption of
this Agreement, and/or their acceptance of any consideration pursuant to this
Agreement, each other Applicable Holder, agrees that:

  

  (i)  Parent shall be able to rely conclusively on the instructions and decisions of the Representative as to the determination of any adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.16_, the settlement of any claims for indemnification by Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to _Article 9_ or any other actions required or permitted to be taken by the Representative hereunder, and no party shall have any cause of action against Parent for any action taken by Parent in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of the Representative;

  

  (ii)  no Applicable Holder shall have any cause of action against the Representative for, and the Representative shall have no liability to any Applicable Holder in connection with, any action taken or omitted, decision made or instruction given by the Representative under this Agreement, except for liability directly resulting from fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Representative;

  

  (iii)  each such Applicable Holder will, on an individual and several basis based on his, her or its Proceeds Pro Rata Basis (and not jointly as to or with any other Applicable Holder) indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Representative in accordance with  _Section 2.18(e)_;

  

  (iv)  the provisions of this _Section 2.18_ are independent and severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Applicable Holder may have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

  (v)  remedies available at law for any breach of the provisions of this _Section 2.18_ may be inadequate; therefore, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving damages if either Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation brings an action to enforce the provisions of this _Section 2.18_; and

  

  (vi)  the provisions of this _Section 2.18_ shall be binding upon the executors, heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successors and permitted assigns of each Applicable Holder, and any references in this Agreement to an Applicable Holder shall mean and include the successors to the Applicable Holder's rights hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary disposition, the Laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

   



 



    

  

2.19   _Withholding Obligations_. Each of Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent and the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to any provision of this Agreement to any Person such amounts that
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any other applicable Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
the Exchange Agent and the Escrow Agent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts shall be (a) remitted by the applicable withholding party to the
applicable Taxing authority and (b) treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Persons in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be. Parent, or the
Exchange Agent or other representative of Parent, shall also have the
right to collect Forms W-8 or W-9, or such other forms relating to United
States federal withholding obligations as may be required, from such Persons.

(c)  There are no Legal Proceedings (except claims for benefits
payable in the normal operation of the Company Plans and proceedings with
respect to qualified domestic relations orders) against or involving any
Company Plan or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Company
Plan that could give rise to any liability to the Company or any Subsidiary.
No Company Plan is or within the last three calendar years has been the

Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for such letter and to
make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination. No such

Knowledge, no act or omission has occurred, that would adversely affect its

Affiliate comply in all material respects with the requirements of

actions or omissions, or those of any predecessor, other than to

own, and not at the Company's, expense. Except for coverage offered solely at
the participant's expense as required pursuant to the continuation coverage

liability of any kind imposed under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable
Law or (ii) any contractual indemnification or contribution obligation
protecting any fiduciary, insurer or service provider with respect to any
Company Plan, nor will the transactions contemplated by this Agreement give
rise to any such liability.

  

(j)  No Company Plan is funded by, associated with or related
to a "voluntary employee's beneficiary association" within the meaning of
Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

  

(k)  Each Company Plan is amendable and terminable unilaterally
by the Company at any time without liability or expense to the Company or
such Company Plan as a result thereof (other than for benefits accrued through
the date of termination or amendment and reasonable administrative expenses
related thereto) and no Company Plan, plan documentation or agreement, summary
plan description or other written communication distributed generally to
employees by its terms prohibits the Company from amending or terminating any
such Company Plan, or in any way limit such action. The investment vehicles,
if any, used to fund any Company Plan may be changed at any time without
incurring a sales charge, surrender fee or other similar expense other than
normal charges that may be imposed to deter frequent trading.

consulted with his, her or its own tax experts regarding the tax consequences
of the Merger, and has not relied upon any representations made by Parent,

and agrees that neither Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel have made any
representations regarding the tax consequences of the Merger.

  

4.5   _Entirely for Own Account_. The Earn-Out Payment Shares, if
any, to be received by such Principal Shareholder pursuant to the Merger will
be acquired for investment for such Principal Shareholder's own account, not

thereof, and such Principal Shareholder has no present intention of selling,
granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same. By
executing this Agreement, such Principal Shareholder further represents that
such Principal Shareholder does not have any contract, undertaking, agreement

4.7   _Restricted Securities_. Such Principal Shareholder
understands that the Earn-Out Payment Shares, if any, issued to him, her or
it will be characterized as "restricted securities" under federal securities

other benefits) contingent on the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i)
of the Code) to the extent necessary so that no payment received by such
"disqualified individual" would be a "parachute payment" under Section
280G(b) of the Code (determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the
Code), in a manner that satisfies the stockholder approval requirements under
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Such vote shall establish the "disqualified individual's" right to the payment
or other compensation, and the Company shall obtain any required waivers or
consents from the "disqualified individual" prior to the vote. At least five
Business Days before the vote, Parent and its counsel shall be given the right
to review and comment on all documents to be delivered to the Shareholders in
connection with such vote and any required disqualified individual waivers or
consents, and the Company shall reflect all reasonable comments of Parent
thereon. Parent and its counsel shall be provided copies of all documents
executed by the Shareholders and disqualified individuals in connection with
the vote.

  

6.11   _FIRPTA_. No more than 10 days before the Closing, (a) the
Company shall deliver to Parent and to Parent a certificate that the Company
is not and in the last five years has not been a "U.S. real property holding
corporation" in accordance with Treasury Regulations under Sections 897 and
1445 of the Code, or (b) each of the Shareholders shall deliver to Merger Sub
certifications that they are not foreign Persons in accordance with the
Treasury Regulations under Section 1445 of the Code. If Parent does not
receive either the notices or the certifications described above on or before
the Effective Time, Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be permitted to
withhold from the payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement any required
withholding Tax under Section 1445 of the Code.

  

6.12   _Expenses_. Except with respect to costs and expenses of
filing and other fees associated with obtaining Consent to consummate the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act and any fees
payable to the Exchange Agent, which shall be borne by the Parent, or as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall pay
its own respective costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including fees and
expenses of its own respective financial advisors, accountants and counsel.

  

6.13   _Indemnification_. Parent agrees that all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liability for acts and
omissions occurring at or before the Closing Date and rights to advancements
of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers, Employees, equityholders and agents of the Company
(collectively, the " _Company Agents_ ") as provided in the Organizational
Documents of the Company, under any contract between the Company and any
Company Agent or under applicable Law shall survive the Merger and shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such Company Agent, unless an
alteration or modification of such document is required by Law or the Company
Agent affected thereby otherwise consents in writing thereto.

   



 



    

  

6.14   _R andW Insurance_. Immediately after the date hereof, Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and have in effect at the
Closing representation and warranty insurance, issued by an insurer and in a
form and providing coverage reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Representative for the benefit of Parent and the Surviving Corporation (" _R
andW Insurance_"). If RandW Insurance is obtained and in effect at the Closing,
the cost of the premium for the RandW Insurance shall be split equally between
the Company and Parent, with the Company's portion thereof being payable at
Closing as a Transaction Expense. To the extent of the coverage of the RandW
Insurance, if obtained, the Escrow Amount to be funded at Closing shall
be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis, provided that in all events the
Escrow Amount shall not be reduced below $2,000,000. If, notwithstanding
Parent's commercially reasonable efforts to obtain RandW Insurance, RandW
Insurance is not obtained and in effect at the Closing, the Closing shall
nevertheless occur, provided that the Escrow Amount shall be unaffected by
this _Section 6.14_. For the avoidance of doubt, no RandW Insurance shall be
obtained unless the Company and Parent mutually approve such RandW Insurance,
and the failure to approve any RandW Insurance shall not constitute a breach of
this _Section 6.14_.

  

6.15   _Notices and Effect of Supplements to Schedules_. Between the
date hereof and the Closing Date, the Representative and the Company, on the
one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, promptly upon becoming aware of any
fact, matter, circumstance or event that occurs or arises after the date
hereof and that causes or that reasonably could be expected to cause such
Party to be in breach or violation of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, shall give notice to the
other Party with respect thereto and supplement or amend the Disclosure
Schedules provided by such Party (including adding new sections of the
Disclosure Schedules if necessary) to reflect any such fact, matter,
circumstance or event, which, if existing, on the date of this Agreement,
would have been required to be set forth or described in such Disclosure
Schedules. Any such notification, supplement or amendment shall not be
effective to cure any breach, violation or inaccuracy in such
representation or warranty, covenant or agreement of such Party contained in
this Agreement for purposes of _Article 9_ and _Article 10_ of this
Agreement. If in any such supplement or amendment of the Schedules delivered
pursuant to this _Section 6.15_ , the Company and/or the Principal
Shareholders disclose an event, change or circumstance which constitutes a
Material Adverse Effect, Parent shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement; provided however, that if Parent does not terminate this Agreement
within five days after receipt of such supplement, Parent will be deemed to
have accepted such supplement or amendment to the Schedules, in which event,
such notification, supplement or amendment shall, without affecting the rights
of the Parties pursuant to the preceding sentence, be effective to qualify
and cure any breach of or inaccuracy in, such representation or warranty made
as of the Closing Date for purposes of _Sections 8.2(a)_ , _8.3(a)_ ,
_9.1(a)(i)_ and _9.2(a)_ of this Agreement, as applicable. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
shall deliver no later than five Business Days before the Closing, by
delivery of an update to _Section 3.5_ of the Disclosure Schedule, the
Restated 2014 Audit, which shall be an update of the Disclosure Schedule for
all purposes under this _Section 6.15_ , except that Parent shall have the
right to seek indemnification pursuant to _Article 9_ if the Restated 2014
Audit includes changes from the Financial Statements that are material and
adverse irrespective of whether such changes constitute a Material Adverse
Effect or whether Parent terminates this Agreement or otherwise objects to
such disclosure.

   



 



    

  

Article 7 
 TAX MATTERS

  

7.1   _Tax Covenants_.

  

(a)  Without the prior written consent of Parent, before the
Closing, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall make, change or rescind
any Tax election, amend any Tax Return or take any position on any Tax Return,
take any action, omit to take any action or enter into any other transaction
that would have the effect of increasing the Tax liability or reducing any Tax
asset of Parent or the Surviving Corporation in respect of any Post-Closing
Tax Period.

  

(b)  All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration,
value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement and Merger (including any
real property transfer Tax and any other similar Tax) shall be borne and paid
equally by the Company Indemnitors and Parent when due. Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall timely file any Tax Return or other document with
respect to such Taxes or fees.

  

(c)  The Company shall terminate any and all existing Tax
sharing agreements (whether written or not) binding upon the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries no later than the Closing Date. After such date neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any further rights or
liabilities thereunder.

  

7.2   _Straddle Period_. In the case of Taxes that are payable
with respect to a taxable period that begins before and ends after the
Closing Date (each such period, a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any
such Taxes that are treated as Pre-Closing Taxes for purposes of this
Agreement shall be:

  

(a)  in the case of Taxes (x) based upon, or related to,
income, receipts, profits, wages, capital or net worth, (y) imposed in
connection with the sale, transfer or assignment of property, or (z) required
to be withheld, deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the
taxable year ended with the Closing Date; and

  

(b)  in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such
Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire period.

  

7.3   _Tax Returns_.

  

(a)  The Company shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by it that
are due on or before the Closing Date (taking into account any extensions),
and shall timely pay all Taxes that are due and payable on or before the
Closing Date (taking into account any extensions), and shall timely pay all
Taxes that are due and payable on or before the Closing Date. Any such Tax
Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice
(unless otherwise required by Law).

   



 



    

  

(b)  Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the
Company after the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and
for any Straddle Period. Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by Law) and, if it is
an income or other material Tax Return, shall be submitted by Parent to the
Representative (together with schedules, statements and, to the extent
requested by the Representative, supporting documentation) at least 30 days
before the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return. If the
Representative objects to any item on any such Tax Return that relates to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, it shall, within ten days after delivery of such Tax
Return, notify Parent in writing that he so objects, specifying with
particularity any such item and stating the specific factual or legal basis
for any such objection. If the Representative timely delivers such a notice
of objection, Parent and the Representative shall negotiate in good faith and
use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such disputed items. If Parent
and the Representative are unable to reach such agreement within ten days
after receipt by Parent of such notice, the Tax Return shall be filed as
prepared by Parent and the disputed items shall be resolved by the Neutral
Accountant, with any determination by the Neutral Accountant being final. The
Neutral Accountant shall resolve any disputed items within 30 days of having
the item referred to it pursuant to such procedures as it may require. If,
based on the resolution of such dispute by the Neutral Accountant, the
applicable Tax Return must be amended, Parent shall amend such Tax Return to
reflect the Neutral Accountant's resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of
the Neutral Accountant shall be borne equally by Parent and the
Representative.

  

(c)  The preparation and filing of any Tax Return of the
Company that does not relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period
shall be exclusively within the control of Parent.

  

7.4   _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. The
Representative, the Company (as the Surviving Corporation after the Closing
Date) and Parent shall provide each other with such cooperation and
information as either of them reasonably may request of the others in filing
any Tax Return pursuant to this _Article 7_ or in connection with any audit
or other proceeding in respect of Taxes of the Company. Such cooperation and
information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns
or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related work
papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by tax
authorities. Each of the Representative, the Company and Parent shall retain
all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents in
its possession relating to Tax matters of the Company for any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other
documents relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent notified
by any of the other Parties in writing of such extensions for the respective
Tax periods. Before transferring, destroying or discarding any Tax Returns,
schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its possession
relating to Tax matters of the Company for any taxable period beginning before
the Closing Date, the Representative, the Company or Parent (as the case may
be) shall provide the other parties with reasonable written notice and offer
the other Parties the opportunity to take custody of such materials.

notification to the Party claimed to have an indemnification obligation under
this _Article 9_ (an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), comprising a Claim Notice or
Expected Claim Notice, of the commencement of any Third Party Action. Such
notification shall be given within 20 days after receipt by the Indemnified
Party of notice of such Third Party Action, and shall describe in reasonable
detail (to the extent then known by the Indemnified Party) the facts
constituting the basis for such Third Party Action and the documents
underlying such Third Party Action, the applicable provisions of this
Agreement comprising the underlying claim, and the amount of the claimed
Damages. No delay or failure on the part of the Indemnified Party in so
notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability or obligation under this _Article 9_ except to the extent of any
damage or liability caused by or arising out of such delay or failure. Within
30 days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon
written notice to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense
of such Third Party Action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party; _provided_ that (i) the Indemnifying Party may only assume
control of such defense if (A) the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing
to the Indemnified Party that any harm, damages, fines, costs or other
liabilities that may be assessed against the Indemnified Party in connection
with such Third Party Action constitute Damages for which the Indemnified
Party shall be indemnified pursuant to this _Article 9_ (subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Article 9_) and (B) an adverse resolution of
the Third Party Action would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the goodwill or reputation of the Indemnified Party or the
business, operations or future conduct of the Indemnified Party, and (ii) the
Indemnifying Party may not assume control of the defense of (A) any Third
Party Action involving a claim under _Section 9.1(a)(v)_ or based on a breach
of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.12_ , (B) a
matter involving possible criminal liability of the Indemnified Party or
any of its Affiliates, or (C) a Third Party Action in which equitable relief
is sought against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates. If the
Indemnifying Party does not, or is not permitted under the terms of this
_Section 9.3(a)_ to, so assume control of the defense of a Third Party
Action, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The Party not
controlling any Third Party Action pursuant to this _Section 9.3(a)_ (the "
_Non-controlling Party_ ") may participate in such defense at its own
expense. The Party controlling any Third Party Action pursuant to this
_Section 9.3(a)_ (the " _Controlling Party_ ") shall keep the Non-
controlling Party advised of the status of such Third Party Action and the
defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the
Non-controlling Party with respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall
furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may have with
respect to such Third Party Action (including copies of any summons,
complaint or other material pleading, motion or memorandum which may have been
served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other
document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise cooperate with
and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such Third Party Action. In
connection with matters for which the Indemnified Party obtains
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_, the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party with respect to a Third Party
Action shall be considered Damages for purposes of this Agreement only if (x)
the Indemnified Party controls the defense of such Third Party Action pursuant
to the terms of this _Section 9.3(a)_ or (y) the Indemnifying Party assumes
control of such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes based
on written advice of counsel that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party have conflicting interests or different defenses available with respect
to such Third Party Action in which case the Indemnified Party's Damages shall
also include legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the Indemnified
Party to the extent relating to such conflicting interests or different
defenses.

   



 



    

  

(b)  The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement
of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Action without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;  _provided_ that the consent
of the Indemnified Party shall not be required if the Indemnifying Party
agrees in writing to pay any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or
judgment and such settlement or judgment includes a complete release of the
Indemnified Party from further liability and imposes no other obligations
(other than those that are ministerial in nature in connection with any such
settlement) on the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates. Except as
provided in this _Section 9.3(a)_ the Indemnified Party shall not agree to
any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third
Party Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

(c)  To seek indemnification under this _Article 9_ for a
claim that is not a Third Party Action (a " _Direct Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice or Expected Claim Notice to the
Indemnifying Party not later than 30 days after the Indemnified Party becomes
aware of such Direct Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice
shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall
include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Damages that has been or
may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have
30 days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct
Claim. The Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its
professional advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to
give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is
payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist
the Indemnifying Party's investigation by giving such information and
assistance as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may
reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such
30 day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such
claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and
subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

  

(d)  The Representative shall have full power and authority on
behalf of each Shareholder to take any and all actions on behalf of, execute
any and all instruments on behalf of, and execute or waive any and all rights
of, the Shareholders under this _Article 9_. The Representative shall have
no liability to any Shareholder for any action taken or omitted on behalf of
the Shareholder pursuant to this _Article 9_.

  

9.4   _Survival of Representations and Warranties_.

  

(a)  Unless otherwise specified in this _Section 9.4_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, all representations and warranties of this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms until the date 18 months following the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) all representations and warranties set
forth in _Sections 3.1_ (Organization), _3.2_ (Authorization), _3.3_  (No
Violation), _3.4_ (Capitalization), and _3.32_ (Brokers) shall survive
indefinitely, (ii) all representations and warranties set forth in 3.18
(Intellectual Property) shall survive for three years after the Closing Date,
and (iii) all representations and warranties set forth in Sections _3.12_
(Tax Matters), _3.14_ (Employee Benefits), and _3.17_ (Environmental), shall
survive until 60 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations. All covenants contained in this Agreement shall survive until
performed fully in accordance with their terms.

   



 



    

  

(b)  No Claim Notice or Expected Claim Notice may be delivered
after termination of the applicable survival period set forth in _Section
9.4(a)_, except for a Claim Notice resulting from the matters described in an
Expected Claim Notice delivered in a timely manner in accordance with
_Section 9.4(a)_. If Parent delivers to the Representative, before expiration
of the applicable representation, warranty or covenant as set forth in
_Section 9.4(a)_, either a Claim Notice or an Expected Claim Notice, then
the applicable representation(s), warranty(s), and/or covenant(s) shall
survive until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of the matter or
matters covered by such notice. If the Legal Proceeding or written claim with
respect to which an Expected Claim Notice has been given is definitively
withdrawn or resolved in favor of the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Corporation shall promptly so notify the Representative.

  

9.5   _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Article 9_:

  

(a)  Neither the Company Indemnitors nor Parent shall be liable
for Damages under _Sections 9.1(a)(i)_ or _9.2(a)_ , respectively, until the
aggregate amount of all Damages from all claims exceeds $500,000 (the "
_Deductible Amount_ "), at which point the Company Indemnitors or Parent, as
applicable, shall become liable for all such Damages under _Section
9.1(a)(i)_ in excess of the Deductible Amount; _provided_ , that the
limitation set forth in this sentence shall not apply in the case of fraud or
the breach of any of the Fundamental Representations.

  

(b)  Except in the case of claims based on a breach of any of
the Fundamental Representations or due to fraud or for breach of any of
covenant, neither the Company Indemnitors nor Parent shall be liable for
Damages under _Sections 9.1(a)(i)_ or  _9.2(a)_ in excess of 10% of the sum
of the Closing Consideration and Earn-Out Payment, in the aggregate. In the
case of claims based on breach of any of the Fundamental Representations,
neither the Company Indemnitors nor Parent, as applicable, shall be liable
for Damages under _Sections 9.1(a)(i)_ or _9.2(a)_ in excess of the Merger
Consideration actually received by the Shareholders.

  

(c)  Except in the case of claims due to fraud, the Company
Indemnitors shall have personal liability, on a Proceeds Pro Rata Basis, for
all Damages incurred by Parent, _provided_ that no Company Indemnitor shall
have any liability for such Damages in excess of the aggregate Merger
Consideration actually received by such Company Indemnitor.

  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be able to collect any Damages directly
from any Company Indemnitor:

  

  (i)   unless and until there are insufficient unclaimed amounts in the Escrow Fund remaining to satisfy such Damages pursuant to the Escrow Agreement;

   



 



    

  

  (ii)  to the extent that a specific accrual or reserve for the amount of such Damage was set forth on the Financial Statements or taken into account in calculating Final Closing Net Working Capital;

  

  (iii)  there are insufficient amounts available to satisfy such Damages from the Contingent Payment, provided that nothing in this  _Section 9.5(d)(iii)_ shall preclude Parent or Merger Sub from asserting any Claim or Expected Claim before the expiration of the Calculation Period; or

  

  (iv)  to the extent that such Damages are covered by the RandW Insurance procured by Parent and the Company pursuant to _Section 6.14_ , if any.

  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, subject
to the other limitations set forth herein, (i) in respect of any
indemnifiable claim brought pursuant to this _Article 9_, each Company
Indemnitor shall only be liable for its share, determined on a Proceeds Pro
Rata Basis, of the Damages determined to be indemnifiable hereunder pursuant
to such claim, and (ii) each Company Indemnitor shall be severally liable
for, and no other Company Indemnitor shall have any liability with respect
to, Damages by reason of or relating to (x) fraud of such Company Indemnitor
who also is a Shareholder committed in such Shareholder's capacity as a
Shareholder or (y) the indemnification obligations set forth in _Section
9.1(b)_, for which the liability of each such Company Indemnitor who is a
Shareholder shall not exceed the aggregate Merger Consideration such
Shareholder actually received at Closing plus amounts contributed to the
Escrow Fund and the Representative Expense Fund by and attributable to such
Shareholder.

  

(f)  No Company Indemnitor shall have any right of contribution
against the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any breach
by the Company of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements.

  

(g)  Subject to _Section 11.16_ , except with respect to claims
based on fraud, and as provided in _Section 2.16_, after the Closing, the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub under this _Article 9_ shall be the exclusive
remedy for Damages of Merger Sub, Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any controlled subsidiary thereof with respect to claims or
Damages resulting from or relating to any misrepresentation, breach of
warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement of the Company
contained in this Agreement or in any other agreement or instrument to which
the Company is a party furnished by the Company (but not, for the avoidance
of doubt, by any Shareholder) to Merger Sub, Parent the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any controlled subsidiary thereof in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(h)  The amount of any Damages payable under this _Article 9_
shall be limited to the amount thereof, if any, that remains after deducting
therefrom an amount equal to (i) the amount by which any insurance proceeds
(other than RandW Insurance) actually received by the Indemnified Party in
respect of any such claim exceed the portion of the Damages (if any) for which
the Indemnified Party has no right to indemnification under this _Article
9_, less (ii) that portion of the policy premium increase in the next policy
period that results from the assertion of such claim, as determined by the
Indemnified Party based on correspondence from the Indemnified Party's
insurance carrier or insurance broker. The Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to recover under applicable insurance
policies for any Damages as to which the Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification under this _Article 9_; provided that the Indemnified Party
shall not be required to assert a claim against such insurance if the
Indemnified Party reasonably believes that the insurance carrier's payment of
such claim would result in a non-renewal of the policy or an increase in
future expected premiums that would make it commercially unreasonable to
obtain insurance on those terms, or would materially and adversely affect the
Indemnified Party's ability to recover against such insurance policy in
respect of expected future claims (and, in such case, the Indemnifying Party
waives all rights of subrogation that it may have in respect of such insurer
upon payment of the related Damages). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
determination of any insurance coverage benefit shall not delay payment or
indemnification of such Damages by an Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified
Party or any Affiliate thereof receives any such insurance proceeds after an
indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, and provided the
Indemnified Party has collected all sums due from the Indemnifying Party, then
the amount of Damages to be recovered by the Indemnified Party shall be
recalculated, taking into account the limitations of this _Section 9.5(h)_,
as if such amounts had been received before the collection of any Damages
under this Agreement and any excess Damages previously collected after
such recalculation shall be repaid to the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if RandW Insurance is obtained, it must be Parent's initial and,
until exhausted, sole recourse for indemnity claims under this _Article 9_
for which coverage is available under the RandW Insurance, except for the
amount of any retention thereunder, which shall be indemnifiable.

   



 



    

  

(i)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, neither Parent, the Company nor any Affiliate thereof shall
be entitled to make any claim for recovery for any Damages related to or
arising from (i) the amount or availability of any Tax asset or attribute of
the Company or (ii) the ability of Parent, the Company or any Affiliate
thereof to utilize any Tax asset or attribute of the Company following the
Closing.

  

(j)  None of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Merger
Sub or any controlled subsidiary thereof shall be entitled to recover Damages
relating to any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the
extent that the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub or any
controlled subsidiary thereof has already recovered Damages with respect to
such matter pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the operation of _Section 2.16_ is an
exclusive remedy in respect to the items to be taken into account in
connection with any adjustment pursuant thereto, and none of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub or any controlled subsidiary thereof shall
be entitled to any additional recourse in respect thereof, whether arising
from a breach of a representation or warranty or otherwise.

  

(k)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
for the purpose of _Sections 9.1(a)(i)_ , _9.1(b)(i)_  and _9.2(a)_ , in
determining the amount of Damages suffered by the Indemnified Party related
to, but not whether there has occurred, a breach of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement for which the Indemnifying Party has
responsibility under this _Article 9_, such representation and warranty
shall be construed without regard to any "material," "Material Adverse
Effect," or similar qualifications set forth herein.

   



 



    

  

9.6   _Tax Treatment_. The Parties agree to treat any indemnity
payment made pursuant to this _Article 9_ as an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration for all Tax purposes.

  

9.7   _Mitigation_. Each of the Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Damages that are subject to a claim for
indemnification under this _Article 9_.

  

Article 10 
 TERMINATION

  

10.1   _Termination and Abandonment_. This Agreement may be
terminated at any time before Effective Time:

  

(a)  by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

  

(b)  by Parent by giving written notice to the Company if the
Company breaches any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement, and such breach, individually or in combination with any other such
breach, (i) would cause any of the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ or
_8.3_ not to be satisfied and (ii) is not cured, if capable of cure, within
15 days following delivery by Parent to the Company of written notice of such
breach;

  

(c)  by the Company by giving written notice to Parent if
Parent is in breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in
this Agreement, and such breach, individually or in combination with any other
such breach, (i) would cause the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ or
_8.2_ not to be satisfied and (ii) is not cured, if capable of cure,
within 15 days following delivery by the Company to Parent of written notice
of such breach;

  

(d)  By Parent by giving written notice to the Company (i) at
any time after the Shareholders have voted on approval of the Merger and the
Requisite Shareholder Approval was not obtained or (ii) if the Requisite
Shareholder Approval has not been obtained within two Business Days after the
date of this Agreement;

  

(e)  By Parent by giving written notice to the Company if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before the later of (i) the date 90
days following the date of this Agreement or (ii) five Business Days after the
satisfaction of the condition precedent set forth in _Section 8.1(e)_ (the "
_Termination Date_ ") by reason of the failure of any condition
precedent under _Sections 8.1_ or _8.3_ (unless the failure results
primarily from a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement); and

  

(f)  By the Company by giving written notice to Parent if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before the Termination Date, by reason
of the failure of any condition precedent under _Sections 8.1_ or _8.2_
(unless the failure results primarily from a breach by the Company of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement).

  

10.2   _Effect of Termination_. If any Party terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no liability on the part of any Party or its
respective officers, directors or shareholders, except for obligations under
_Section 6.2(c)_, this _Article 10_ and _Article 11_, all of which
shall survive the termination.

Agreement.

  

11.14   _Jurisdiction and Forum_.

  

(a)  By the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in
the State of Delaware for any action to interpret or enforce this Agreement,
and agree that service of process upon the Representative may be accomplished
in the manner specified for notices under _Section 11.1_. The foregoing shall
not limit the rights of any Party to serve process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

  

(b)  To the extent that any Party has or hereafter may acquire
any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process
(whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment
in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to such Party or
such Party's property, such Party hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in
respect of his, her or its obligations with respect to this Agreement.

  

(c)  Each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably agrees
that Action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise)
arising out of, or relating to, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the performance of services hereunder or thereunder, brought by
any Party or its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in the
Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the
State of Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware
state or federal court within the State of Delaware) (each, a " _Chosen
Court_ "), and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for itself and with respect to its
property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Each of the
Parties agrees not to commence any Action (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) arising out of, or relating to, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the performance of services
hereunder except in the Chosen Courts, other than any such Action in any court
of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered

provided in this Agreement shall constitute sufficient service of process and
the Parties further waive any argument that such service is insufficient.
Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees
not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise,
in any Action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise)
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for any reason, (b) that it
or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such Chosen Court
or from any legal process commenced in such Chosen Courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid
of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that
(i) the Action in any such Chosen Court is brought in an inconvenient forum,
(ii) the venue of such Action is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such Chosen Courts.

   



 



    

  

11.15   _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY
AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION, CLAIM, SUIT, LITIGATION
OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  

11.16   _Enforcement; Specific Performance_.

  

(a)  The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if
the Company fails to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and that Merger Sub
shall be entitled to specific performance in such event, in addition to any
other remedy at law or in equity.

  

(b)  The Parties agrees that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by the Company of any covenant or obligation contained in
this Agreement, Merger Sub shall be entitled to seek and obtain (i) a decree
or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of
such covenant or obligation, and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach. In circumstances where the Company is obligated to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
such transactions have not been consummated, the Parties expressly
acknowledge and agree that Merger Sub and its shareholders shall have
suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate to
compensate Merger Sub and its shareholders, and that Merger Sub, on behalf of
itself and its shareholders, shall be entitled to enforce specifically the
Company's obligation to consummate such transactions.

  

(c)  The Parties further agree that no other Party or any other
Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
expressly available pursuant to this _Section 11.16_, and each Party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy expressly available pursuant to this
_Section 11.16_.

  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Parties agree that, before the Closing, the Company shall not be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by
Merger Sub or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement.

  

11.17   _Construction_.

the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no
rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Party.

   



 



    

  

(b)  Any reference in this Agreement to "including" shall be
interpreted as "including without limitation".

  

(c)  Any reference to any Article, Section or paragraph shall
be deemed to refer to an Article, Section or paragraph of this Agreement,
unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

  

(d)  Any dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as
a determinative benchmark for establishing what is or is not "material" or a
"Material Adverse Effect" under this Agreement.

  

(e)  Any reference in this Agreement to a statute shall be to
such statute, as amended from time to time, and to the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder.

  

(f)  When reference is made in this Agreement to information
that has been "made available" to the Merger Sub , that shall mean that such
information was either (i) contained in the Company's electronic data room no
later than 5:00 p.m., Mountain Time, on January 30, 2016, or (ii) delivered
to Merger Sub or its counsel before such date.

  

11.18   _Representative Counsel_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Merger Sub, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
