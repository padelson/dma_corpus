be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with the
Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall
cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation").

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9 the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place in Palo Alto, California at the offices of
Covington and Burling LLP, 5 Palo Alto Square, 10th Floor, Palo Alto, CA
94306-2112 as soon as possible, but in any event no later than three Business
Days after the date the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those
conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent

 permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such
conditions, or at such other place or time as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Closing Date."

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall execute and file a
certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the Delaware Law and shall make all other filings or
recordings required by the Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The
Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as such
certificate of merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties in
writing and specified in such certificate of merger).

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the properties, rights, powers, privileges, immunities, licenses,
franchises and authority and be subject to all of the obligations,
liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger
Subsidiary, all as provided under this Agreement and the Delaware Law.

Section 2.02. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Company:

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(c) or
Section 2.04, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock" or the "Shares," and
each, a "Share") immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into the right to receive $8.00 in cash, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, each certificate formerly
representing any Shares (each, a "Certificate") or any book-entry shares which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (each, an
"Uncertificated Share") shall automatically be canceled and retired and all
Shares represented thereby shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in
accordance with Section 2.03.

(b) Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock or otherwise owned by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and retired, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) Each Share held by any Subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other than
Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall be
converted into such number of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation
such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the outstanding
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the

 Surviving Corporation (except for any such shares resulting from the
conversion of Shares pursuant to Section 2.02(c)). From and after the
Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of common stock of Merger
Subsidiary shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

Section 2.03. Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying
Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) the
Certificates and (ii) the Uncertificated Shares. On the Closing Date, Parent
or one of its Affiliates shall deliver, or cause to be delivered to, the
Paying Agent, as needed, the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect
of all the Shares of the Company represented by the Certificates and the
Uncertificated Shares in accordance with this Agreement (such cash, the
"Consideration Fund"). In the event the Consideration Fund shall be
insufficient to pay the Merger Consideration (including on account of any
Merger Consideration returned to Parent pursuant to Section 2.03(g)), Parent
shall promptly deliver, or cause to be delivered, additional funds to the
Paying Agent in an amount equal to the deficiency required to make such
payments. The Consideration Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five Business
Days), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each
record holder of Shares at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and
instructions (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares
to the Paying Agent) for use in such exchange.

(b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to
the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or such other materials as contemplated in
Section 2.09), together with a properly completed and validly executed letter
of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably requested by the
Paying Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the
Merger Consideration payable for each Share represented by such Certificate or
for each such Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as
the case may be, and subject to the terms of Section 2.04, each such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time
for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable
upon the surrender or transfer of any Certificate or Uncertificated Shares.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent and
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 (d) Until disbursed in accordance with this Agreement, the cash in the
Consideration Fund will be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent;
provided, however, that any such investments shall be short-term obligations
of or fully guaranteed by the United States or backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30 days. No losses
with respect to any investments of the Consideration Fund will affect the
amounts payable to the holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares under
this Agreement. Any earnings, interest or other income from investment of the
Consideration Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and
shall be paid as Parent directs.

(e) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article
2.

(f) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (and any earnings, interest or other
income earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares six
months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent or one of its
Affiliates, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged its Shares
for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws), as general creditors thereof, for payment of the
Merger Consideration in respect of such Shares without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall
be liable to any holder of Shares for any amounts paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares shall, immediately prior to
the time when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority, become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 2.03(a) to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have
been perfected shall be returned to Parent or one of its Affiliates upon
demand.

(h) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or
transfer of Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares.

Section 2.04. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.02 or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled in accordance with
Section 2.02(b) or Section 2.02(c)) and held by a holder who has not voted in
favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has properly
demanded appraisal for its Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
Delaware Law and who has otherwise complied with all applicable provisions of
Section 262 of the Delaware Law shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, but shall be entitled only to such rights as
are granted by Section 262 of the Delaware Law, unless such holder fails to
perfect, waives,

 withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the
Delaware Law, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the Delaware
Law. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, waives,
withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the
Delaware Law, or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the
Delaware Law, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted
pursuant to Section 2.02(a) as of the Effective Time into, and shall represent
only, the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
2.03 upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such Share or
transfer of such Uncertificated Share, as the case may be. The Company shall
give Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Shares, any waiver or withdrawal of any such demand, and any
other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and, following the Effective Time, to direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, offer
to settle or settle any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.05. Company Stock Options and Company RSUs. (a) At or immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each option to acquire Shares granted or issued
pursuant to any Employee Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested (collectively, the "Company Stock
Options"), shall be, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, canceled and converted into the right to receive,
at or promptly after the Effective Time, solely an amount in cash equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable per Share exercise price of such canceled Company Stock Option
multiplied by (ii) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of
doubt, if the per Share exercise price under any Company Stock Option is equal
to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall
be canceled as of the Effective Time without payment therefor and shall have
no further force or effect. Holders of unvested Company Stock Options shall be
afforded an opportunity to exercise such Company Stock Options prior to, and
contingent upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted
stock unit granted or issued pursuant to any Employee Plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Company RSUs")
shall be, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, canceled and converted into the right to receive, at or
promptly after the Effective Time, solely an amount in cash equal to the
product of (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) (A) for Company
RSUs subject to time-based vesting, the total number of Shares subject to such
Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (B) for any other
Company RSUs, the number of Shares that would be payable if such Company RSU
was vested at target performance.

(b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted Share
granted or issued pursuant to any Employee Plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Company Restricted
Shares" and, together with Company Stock Options and Company RSUs, "Company

been funded by, a "voluntary employees' beneficiary association" within the
meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code or other funding arrangement for the
provision of welfare benefits.

(e) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code is so qualified and has been so qualified during the period since
its adoption, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred
since the date of such determination that would adversely affect such
qualification.

(f) Each Employee Plan has been established, maintained, funded, and
administered in compliance in all material respects with its terms and with
all Applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code. No Action (other than
routine claims for benefits) is pending against or involves or, to the
Company's Knowledge, is threatened against or threatens to involve, any
Employee Plan before any court or arbitrator or any Governmental Authority,
including the IRS and the Department of Labor. There are no controversies
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened between the Company
and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Company Employees, on the
other. No investigation, review, complaint or proceeding by any Governmental
Authority or Company Employee with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries
in relation to the employment of any individual is pending or, to the
Company's Knowledge, threatened, nor has the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries received any written notice from any Governmental Authority
indicating an intention to conduct the same.

(g) No asset of any Employee Plan consists of employer securities (within the
meaning of Section 407(d)(1) of ERISA). Each Employee Plan that provides
health or life insurance benefits is fully insured by a third party insurance
company.

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates nor any of their
directors, officers, employees or agents, nor any fiduciary, trustee or
administrator of any Employee Plan or trust created under any Employee Plan,
has engaged in or been a party to any non-exempt "prohibited transaction" as
defined in Section 4975 of the Code and Section 406 of ERISA, and to the
Company's Knowledge, no non-exempt "prohibited transaction," within the
meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, has occurred with
respect to any Employee Plan. No events have occurred with respect to any
Employee Plan that would reasonably be expected to result in the assessment of
any excise taxes or penalties against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in a material amount.

 (i) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation of or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to,
or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Employee Plan that
would materially increase the expense of maintaining such plan above the level
of expense incurred in respect thereof for the fiscal year ended on the
Company Balance Sheet Date.

(j) All contributions, premiums and payments that are due have been made for
each Employee Plan within the time periods prescribed by the terms of such
plan and Applicable Law, and all contributions, premiums and payments for any
period ending on or before the Closing Date that are not due are properly
accrued to the extent required to be accrued under applicable accounting
principles and have been properly reflected on the Company Balance Sheet or
disclosed in the notes thereto.

(k) Except as provided in Section 4.18(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or together with any other
event) will (i) entitle any current or former Service Provider to any payment
or benefit, including any bonus, retention, severance, retirement or job
security payment or benefit, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, or increase the amount payable or trigger any
other obligation under, any Employee Plan or (iii) limit or restrict the right
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, after the Closing, Parent or any
of its Affiliates, to merge, amend or terminate any Employee Plan.

(l) No Employee Plan or other compensation benefit or arrangement,
individually or collectively, would reasonably be expected to result in the
payment of any amount that would not be deductible under Section 280G of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to
gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any current or former Service
Provider for any Tax incurred by such Service Provider, including under
Sections 280G, 409A, or Section 4999 of the Code.

(m) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject
to, or is currently negotiating in connection with entering into, any
Collective Bargaining Agreement, and there is no, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, there never has been any, organizational campaign, petition or other
unionization activity pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened,
seeking recognition of a collective bargaining unit relating to any Company
Employee. No Company Employees belong, or have during the period of their
engagement by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries belonged, to any trade
union or similar body, and no trade union or similar body is recognized by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no representatives representing
all or any Company Employees.

(n) There are no material unfair labor practice complaints pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries before the National Labor Relations Board or any other
Governmental Authority. There is no, and there has never been, any labor
strike, slowdown, stoppage, picketing, material interruption of work or
lockout

 pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(o) The Company and its Subsidiaries are, and since January 1, 2015 have been,
in compliance in all material respects with all Applicable Laws relating to
labor and employment, including, but not limited to, (i) those relating to
labor management relations, wages, hours, overtime, mandatory employment-
related benefits, employee classification, equal opportunity, discrimination,
sexual harassment, disability accommodation, protected leave, civil rights,
affirmative action, work authorization, immigration, safety and health,
information privacy and security, wage payment, the payment and withholding of
Taxes and workers compensation and (ii) the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act (the "WARN Act") and any comparable foreign, state or local
law.

(p) The Company and/or its Subsidiaries have complied with any obligations to
inform and consult with Company Employees as required by Applicable Law (to
the extent applicable in the jurisdictions in which the relevant Company
Employees are employed) or any agreement, arrangement, custom or practice to
which the Company and/or its Subsidiaries are subject.

(q) Each Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code satisfies in all material
respects the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and has been operated in
compliance in all material respects with the terms of such plan and the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code, in each case such that no Tax is,
has been, or (if administered in accordance with its terms) could be due or
payable under Section 409A of the Code. The exercise price of each Company
Stock Option is not less than the fair market value (within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code) of a Share on the date of grant of such Company
Stock Option and all such Company Stock Options are exempt from Section 409A
of the Code. Each Company Stock Option (now outstanding or previously
exercised) intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section
422 of the Code so qualified at all times prior to the exercise thereof. At
all times, the ESPP has qualified as an "employee stock purchase plan" under
Section 423 of the Code, and all options to purchase shares under the ESPP
(now outstanding or previously exercised or forfeited) have satisfied
Applicable Law, including the requirements of Section 423 of the Code.

(r) The Company and its Subsidiaries have properly accrued on the Company
Balance Sheet all personal time off owed to Company Employees.

(s) To the Company Knowledge, in the last ten years, (a) no allegations of
sexual harassment have been made against any Company Employee who is (i) an
executive officer or (ii) at the level of senior vice president or above, and
(b) the Company and its Affiliates have not entered into any settlement
agreements related to allegations of sexual harassment or misconduct by a
Company Employee.

Section 6.02. Access to Information. (a) From the date of this Agreement until

Agreement, the Company shall (i) give to Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access during regular business hours upon reasonable advance notice
to the offices, properties, assets, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish to Parent and its Representatives such financial
and operating data and other information as such Persons may reasonably
request and (iii) instruct the Representatives of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to cooperate with Parent in its investigation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would (A) violate any of its obligations to third parties with
respect to confidentiality agreements, (B) jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege or attorney work product immunity or (C) contravene any Applicable
Law; provided that the Company has taken reasonable steps to permit inspection
of or to disclose such information and to respond in a timely manner to all

on a basis that does not violate obligations to third parties, compromise the
Company's attorney-client privilege or other attorney work product immunity
with respect thereto or contravene applicable law, including for example,
pursuant to a "clean room" or "clean team" arrangement. Any investigation
pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be conducted in such manner as not to
interfere

 unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and will be subject to the Company's reasonable security measures
and insurance requirements and will not include the right to perform invasive
testing or soil, air or groundwater sampling, including any Phase I or Phase
II environmental site assessments. No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder. The
information provided pursuant to this Section 6.02 will be used solely for the
purpose of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and such information will be kept confidential by Parent and Merger
Subsidiary and their respective Representatives in accordance with the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement will apply to
any information obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in connection
with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by
Section 6.02(a). In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent and the Company shall
comply with, and shall cause their respective Representatives to comply with,
all of their respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, which
shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms
set forth therein.

Section 6.03. Company Stockholder Meeting. (a) The Company shall take all
action necessary to cause a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company
Stockholder Meeting") to be duly called and held as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the SEC or its staff advises that it has no further comments
on the Company Proxy Statement or that the Company may commence mailing the
Company Proxy Statement for the purpose of voting on the approval and adoption
of this Agreement and shall comply with all Applicable Laws with respect to
such meeting and the solicitation of proxies in connection therewith. The
Company shall cause the Company Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
stockholders of the Company as of the record date established for the Company
Stockholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter. Unless
an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to solicit from the Company's stockholders proxies
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and shall take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval.

(a) Subject to Section 6.04, the Board of Directors shall make the Company
Board Recommendation and not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change.

(b) Any adjournment, delay or postponement of the Company Stockholder Meeting
shall require the prior written consent of the Parent, except that the Company
shall, without obtaining such prior written consent, be permitted to adjourn,
delay or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting (i) if there are not holders
of a sufficient number of Shares present or represented by proxy at the
Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder
Meeting or (ii) if the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting by Applicable Law, order or a request from the SEC or its
staff, in each case, with respect to (i), on one occasion for no more than 10
Business Days (with the actual number of days selected by the Company
following good faith consultation with Parent). Without the prior written
consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) shall be the only matter (other
than matters of procedure and matters required by Applicable Law to be voted
on by the Company's stockholders in connection with the approval of

 this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) that the Company
shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company
Stockholder Meeting.

Section 6.04. No Solicitation; Other Offers. (a) General Prohibitions. The
Company, its Subsidiaries and the persons specified on Section 6.04(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (such persons, the "Specified Persons") shall not,
and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not authorize or direct any of its
or their other directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, consultants or other agents, auditors, advisors or other
representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, propose,
seek or take any action for the purpose of the making, submission or
announcement of, or knowingly facilitate, assist, induce or encourage the
making, submission or announcement of, any proposal that constitutes, or that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into, engage in, participate in or maintain or continue any discussions or
negotiations with, furnish any non-public information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties,
assets, books, records or other non-public information of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to, or otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way with, or
knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate, induce or encourage, any effort
by any Third Party concerning an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) (A) fail to make,
qualify, withdraw, withhold, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Subsidiary, or propose publicly to qualify, withdraw, withhold, amend
or modify, the Company Board Recommendation, (B) adopt, endorse, approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to adopt, endorse, approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal, (C) publicly make any recommendation in connection with
a tender offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation against such
offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Board of Directors (or
a committee thereof) to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the 1934 Act (or any substantially similar
communication) (it being understood that the Board of Directors (or a
committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the tenth Business Day
after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such
Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered a violation of this
Section 6.04), (D) subject to clause (C), following the date on which any
Acquisition Proposal or material modification thereto is first made public,
fail to issue a press release reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation
within five Business Days after a written request by Parent to do so (it being
understood that the Company will not be obligated to issue such a press
release on more than five occasions) or (E) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Company Proxy Statement that is mailed to the Company's
stockholders (any of the foregoing in this clause (iii), an "Adverse
Recommendation Change"), (iv) approve any transaction under, or any Person
becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section 203 of the Delaware Law,
(v) submit any Acquisition Proposal or any matter related thereto to the vote
of the stockholders of the Company, or (vi) authorize or commit to do any of
the foregoing. It is agreed that (a) any action taken by a Representative of
the Company (other than a Specified Person) that is authorized or directed by
the Company or any Specified Person or that a Specified Person is made aware
of and does not take action to cease and that, if taken by the Company, would
constitute a breach of this Section 6.04, will be deemed to constitute a
breach by the Company of this Section 6.04; and (b) any action taken by a
Specified Person and that, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach
of this Section 6.04, will be deemed to constitute a breach by the Company of
this Section 6.04. Notwithstanding

 anything to the contrary in this Section 6.04, neither (1) the determination
in itself by the Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) that an
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal nor (2) the delivery in itself by the Company to Parent of any notice
contemplated by Section 6.04(c) will constitute an Adverse Recommendation
Change or violate this Section 6.04(a).

(b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 6.04(a), at any time prior to the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,

(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (A)
contact any Third Party and its Representatives that, subject to the Company's
compliance with Section 6.04(a), has made (and not withdrawn) after the date
of this Agreement a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal that was not
solicited in breach of this Section 6.04 to the extent necessary to clarify
the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and engage in
negotiations or discussions with any Third Party and its Representatives that,
subject to the Company's compliance with Section 6.04(a), has made (and not
withdrawn) after the date of this Agreement a bona fide, written Acquisition
Proposal that was not solicited in breach of this Section 6.04 and that the
Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) reasonably believes in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor, is or
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined below)
and (B) furnish to such Third Party or its Representatives non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided solely for
informational purposes to Parent) with such Third Party on customary terms for
transactions of this type; provided that all such information (to the extent
that such information has not been previously provided or made available to
Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to
or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available
to such Third Party or its Representatives; and

(ii) subject to compliance with Section 6.04(d), the Board of Directors (or a
committee thereof) may make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to
any positive material change, effect, development, circumstance, condition,
event or occurrence that as of the date of this Agreement was not known to the
Board of Directors, or the consequences of which (based on facts known to the
Board of Directors as of the date of this Agreement) were not reasonably
foreseeable as of the date of this Agreement (an "Intervening Event");
provided that in no event shall any of the following constitute or contribute
to an Intervening Event: (A) changes in the financial or securities markets or
general economic, political or business conditions in the United States or
other jurisdictions in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
operations, (B) changes (including changes of Applicable Law) or conditions
generally affecting the industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate, (C) changes in GAAP or other applicable accounting rules or (D) the
receipt,

 existence or terms of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, offer, request
or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal;

provided that in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii)
only if the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law.

So long as the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) expressly reaffirms
the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure and public statement
(other than in a customary "stop, look and listen" communication to the
Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act): (i) nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Board of
Directors (or a committee thereof) from taking and disclosing to the Company's
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
in each case in response to a tender offer, but, except as otherwise permitted
under this Section 6.04, such disclosure must be limited to: (A) making a
"stop, look and listen" communication by the Board of Directors (or a
committee thereof) to the Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the 1934 Act (or any substantially similar communication);
(B) an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal complying with
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the 1934 Act; or (C)
informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this
Section 6.04; and (ii) it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this
Agreement, a factually accurate public statement by the Company or the Board
of Directors (or a committee thereof) that (A) describes the Company's receipt
of an Acquisition Proposal; (B) identifies the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal; (C) provides the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal; or (D)
describes the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto will not, in
any case, be deemed to be (1) a qualification, withdrawal, withholding,
amendment or modification, or proposal by the Board of Directors (or a
committee thereof) to qualify, withdraw, withhold, amend or modify the Company
Board Recommendation; (2) an adoption, approval or recommendation with respect
to such Acquisition Proposal; or (3) an Adverse Recommendation Change.

(c) Required Notices. The Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) shall
not take any of the actions referred to in Section 6.04(b) unless the Company
shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it
intends to take such action. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in
no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or, to the actual
knowledge of the Specified Persons, any of its Representatives) of any
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry from any Third Party related to making a
potential Acquisition Proposal or if any non-public information that would
reasonably be expected by the Company to relate to the making of a potential
Acquisition Proposal is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or, to the actual
knowledge of the Specified Persons, any of its Representatives in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide such notice in
writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and
conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis concerning the
status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal

 (including any amendments thereto), indication or request, and shall promptly
(but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies
of all correspondence and written materials sent by or provided to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives that
describes any terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal (as well as
written summaries of any material oral communications addressing such
matters). The Company shall provide Parent with at least 24 hours prior notice
of any meeting of the Board of Directors (or such lesser notice as is provided
to the Board of Directors) at which the Board of Directors is reasonably
expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal. Any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of the Company's compliance with this Section 6.04(c).

(d) Last Look. Further, the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) shall
not make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 6.04(b) (or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i)), unless (i) if such
Adverse Recommendation Change is to be taken in circumstances involving or
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company provides written notice to Parent, at
least four Business Days before taking such action of its intention to do so,
containing (A) in the case of any action intended to be taken in circumstances
involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal, the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal, including the most current version of the proposed
agreement under which such Acquisition Proposal is proposed to be consummated
and the identity of the Third Party making the Acquisition Proposal or (B) in
the case of any action intended to be taken in circumstances not involving or
relating to an Acquisition Proposal (including an Intervening Event), a
reasonably detailed description of the underlying facts giving rise to, and
the reasons for taking, such action and (iii) after the Company or its
Representatives negotiates with Parent in good faith, Parent does not make,
within four Business Days after its receipt of that written notification, an
offer that (1) in the case of any action intended to be taken in circumstances
involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal, is at least as favorable to
the stockholders of the Company as such Acquisition Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new written
notification from the Company and a new two-Business Day period under this
Section 6.04(d)) or (2) in the case of any action intended to be taken in
circumstances not involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal (including
an Intervening Event), after receipt of such offer, the Board of Directors (or
a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. The Company agrees that, during any
applicable four or two-Business Day period referred to in this Section
6.04(d), the Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith
with Parent and its Representatives regarding any revisions proposed by Parent
to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Definition of Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior
Proposal" means a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal that was not
solicited in breach of this Section 6.04 (with all percentages in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal deemed to refer to 50%) on terms that the
Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) determines, in good faith, after
consultation with a financial advisor and outside legal counsel, are more
favorable from a financial

 point of view to the Company's stockholders than as provided hereunder (taking
into account any revisions proposed by Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 6.04(d) or otherwise at the time of such
determination and after taking into account those factors and matters deemed
relevant in good faith by the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof),
including the identity of the Person making the proposal, the likelihood of
consummation in accordance with the terms of such proposal and the legal,
financial (including the financing terms), regulatory, timing and other
aspects of such proposal).

(f) Obligation of the Company to Terminate Existing Discussions. The Company
shall, shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall direct its and their
respective Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated
any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any
Third Party and its Representatives conducted on or prior to the date of this
Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly after
the date of this Agreement instruct any such Third Party and its
Representatives in possession of confidential information heretofore furnished
to such Third Party and its Representatives by or on behalf of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and other materials prepared by or
on behalf of such Third Party and its Representatives that contain, reflect or
analyze that information) to return or destroy all such information as
promptly as practicable.

Section 6.05. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and
the Board of Directors (or a duly formed committee thereof satisfying the
applicable requirements of the 1934 Act) shall take all such steps as may be
reasonably required or appropriate to cause any dispositions of Shares
(including derivative securities with respect to such Shares) resulting from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act with
respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the

ARTICLE 7 
COVENANTS OF PARENT

Parent agrees that:

Section 7.01. Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement.

Section 7.02. Voting of Shares. Parent shall vote all Shares beneficially
owned or controlled by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of adoption of
this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

Section 7.03. Director and Officer Liability. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the following:

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of
the Company (each, an "Indemnified Person") against any costs, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, of whatever nature,
in respect of, arising out of or related to such Indemnified Person's service
as a director or officer of the Company in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware Law or any other Applicable
Law or provided under the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws in
effect on the date of this Agreement; provided that such indemnification shall
be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable Law.

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, maintain in effect provisions in
the Surviving Corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or in
such documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation)
regarding elimination of liability and indemnification of, and advancement of
expenses to, Indemnified Persons that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement (it being understood that if any claim is asserted against any
individual entitled to the protections of such provisions within such six-year
period, then such provisions shall not be modified until the final disposition
of such claims).

 (c) The Surviving Corporation shall either (i) maintain in effect for a period
of six years after the Effective Time, if available, the directors' and
officers' insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies of the
Company (collectively, "DandO Insurance") in place as of the date of this
Agreement or (ii) purchase comparable DandO Insurance or "tail" insurance
policies with a claims period of six years from the Effective Time, with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as
favorable as those contained in the Company's DandO Insurance policies in effect
as of the date of this Agreement, in each case with respect to any claim
related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time; provided that
in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend
for such policies pursuant to this Section 7.03(c) a premium amount in excess
of 300% of the annual premium amount paid by the Company for such insurance in
its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement, which amount is
set forth in Section 7.03(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. If such
insurance coverage cannot be obtained at an annual premium equal to or less
than such amount, the Surviving Corporation will obtain directors' and
officers' insurance (or "tail" coverage) with the greatest coverage available,
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount from an insurance carrier with a comparable credit
rating as the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance carrier
as of the date of this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, and in lieu of
maintaining the DandO Insurance pursuant to this Section 7.03(c), the Company
may (or, if the Parent requests, the Company will) purchase a prepaid "tail"
policy (the "Tail Policy") with respect to the DandO Insurance from an insurance
carrier with a comparable credit rating as the Company's current directors'
and officers' liability insurance carrier so long as the cost for the Tail
Policy does not exceed 300% of the annual premium amount paid by the Company
for such insurance in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this
Agreement. If the Company purchases the Tail Policy prior to the Effective
Time, then the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain the Tail Policy in full force and effect and continue
to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as the Tail Policy is in full
force and effect.

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.03.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.03 shall be in
addition to any other rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under the
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law, or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and are
intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, such Indemnified
Person and such Indemnified Person's heirs, executors or similar relatives.
These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and shall not be amended
in a manner that is adverse to the Indemnified Persons without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Persons affected thereby.

 Section 7.04. Employee Matters. (a) For the period commencing on the Effective
Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof (or, if shorter, during the
period of employment), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, provide Continuing Employees with (i) an aggregate base salary or base
wages and cash target bonus opportunity no less than the aggregate base salary
or base wages and cash target bonus opportunity provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) benefits (other than
any equity or equity-based and change in control or transaction-based
compensation or benefits or severance pay or benefits) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to either (A) those offered to similarly situated
employees of Parent or Parent's Affiliates or (B) those offered by the Company
to the Continuing Employees as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
with the determination of the employee benefits under clause (ii) to be made
by Parent from time to time in its sole and absolute discretion, based on
Parent's evaluation of the nature and scope of the Continuing Employees'
duties, principal locations, grade level and performance, among other things.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall
have any obligation to issue, or adopt any plans or arrangements providing for
the issuance of, shares of capital stock, warrants, options, stock
appreciation rights or other rights in respect of any shares of capital stock
of any entity or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable or
exercisable for, such shares pursuant to any such plans or arrangements.

(b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA) maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which any Continuing
Employee will participate on or after the Effective Time, but excluding (i)
any retiree healthcare or life insurance plans or programs maintained by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) any equity compensation arrangement
(the "Parent Benefit Plans"), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, recognize all service with the Company or any Subsidiary
rendered prior to the Effective Time by Continuing Employees who are active
Company Employees immediately prior to the Closing, for purposes of vesting
and eligibility (but not benefit accrual), to the extent such Continuing
Employees otherwise would be eligible to participate or vest under the terms
of such Parent Benefit Plans; provided that service of a Continuing Employee
prior to the Effective Time shall not be recognized for the purpose of any
entitlement to participate in, or receive benefits with respect to, (i) any
retiree medical programs or other retiree welfare benefit programs maintained
by Parent or its Affiliates in which any Continuing Employee participates
after the Effective Time or (ii) for purposes of early retirement subsidies
under any Parent Benefit Plan. In no event shall anything contained in this
Section 7.04(b) result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of
service. In addition, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (A)
waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-
existing conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived under any
comparable plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries applicable to such
Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time and (B) recognize, for
purposes of satisfying the deductibles, out-of-pocket limits, offsets, co-
payments, co-insurance, or similar costs or payments under its medical, dental
and vision plans, the deductibles, out-of-pocket limits, offsets, co-payments,
co-insurance, or similar costs or payments recognized under the corresponding
Employee Plan with respect to a Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

(c) This Section 7.04 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 7.04,
express or implied, shall confer

 upon any Service Provider or former Service Provider (including any
beneficiary or dependent of such Service Provider or former Service Provider),
or any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Section 7.04. Nothing contained herein, express or implied
shall: (i) be construed to establish, amend or modify any Employee Plan; (ii)
alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Employee Plan at
any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them; or
(iii) prevent the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates from terminating the employment of any Service Provider (including
any Continuing Employee) following the Effective Time. This Section 7.04 shall
not create any right in any Service Provider (including any Continuing
Employee) or any other Person to any continued employment with the Company,
Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever, or
otherwise alter any existing at-will employment relationship between any
Service Provider and the Company or Surviving Corporation.

any failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such
untruth, inaccuracy, or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions

 to the obligations of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate the Merger
set forth in Section 9.02 (other than Section 9.02(v) and Section 9.02(vi)) to
fail to be satisfied at the Closing.

failure by Parent or Merger Subsidiary to comply with or satisfy in any

satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the
extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be expected
to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate
the Merger set forth in Section 9.03 to fail to be satisfied at the Closing.

(b) In no event shall (i) the delivery of any notice by a party pursuant to
this Section 8.05 limit or otherwise affect the respective rights, remedies,

not cured by the Company within 30 days of receipt by the Company of written
notice of such breach or failure or (B) the Company shall have materially
breached any of its covenants and agreements under Section 6.04;

(d) by the Company, if, prior to the Effective Time:

(i) the Board of Directors shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change in
compliance with the terms of this Agreement, including Section 6.04, in order
to enter into a definitive, written agreement immediately following such

 termination in respect of a Superior Proposal; provided that such termination
shall only occur if the Company shall have paid (or caused to be paid) any
amounts due pursuant to Section 11.04(b) in accordance with the terms, and at
the times, specified therein; or

(ii) Parent or Merger Subsidiary shall have materially breached or failed to
perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would cause the conditions set
forth in Section 9.01 or Section 9.03 not to be satisfied, and such breach or
failure is incapable of being cured by the End Time or, if curable by the End
Time, is not cured by Parent within 30 days of receipt by Parent of written
notice of such breach or failure.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01
(other than pursuant to Section 10.01(a)) shall give written notice of such
termination to the other parties, which written notice shall specify the
provision of this Section 10.01 pursuant to which such termination is being
effected.

Section 10.02. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 10.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect without
liability of any party to this Agreement (or any stockholder, director,
officer, employee, agent, consultant or Representative of such party) to any
other party hereto; provided that, if such termination shall result from the
(a) intentional failure of any party to fulfill a condition to the performance
of the obligations of another party, (b) material breach by any party of the
covenants required to be performed by such party pursuant to this Agreement or
(c) willful and intentional breach by any party of the representations and
warranties made by such party pursuant to this Agreement, then such failing or
breaching party shall be fully liable for any and all liabilities and damages
incurred or suffered by another party as a result of such failure or breach.
The provisions of Section 6.02(b), and Article 11 (and any related definitions
contained in any such Sections or Article) and this Section 10.02 shall
survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 10.01.

and warranties contained herein and in any certificate or other writing
delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time.

Section 11.03. Amendments and Waivers. %3) Any provision of this Agreement may

amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party
against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided that after the Company

that would require the further approval of the stockholders of the Company
under the Delaware Law without such approval having first been obtained.

(a) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or

herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 11.04. Expenses.

(a) General. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs, fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense,
whether or not such transactions are consummated.

(b) Termination Fees.

(i) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i)
or by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i), then the Company shall pay
(or cause to be paid) to Parent in immediately available funds $43,000,000
(the "Company Termination Fee"), in the case of a termination by Parent,
within two Business Days after such termination and, in the case of a
termination by the Company, concurrently with such termination.

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
10.01(c)(ii) or by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
10.01(b)(ii), (B) after the date of this Agreement and prior to such
termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or
otherwise communicated to the

 Company, the Board of Directors or the Company's stockholders (provided that
in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(ii)(A), all
percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to refer
to 50%), and (C) within 12 months following the date of such termination, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into a definitive
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal
shall have been consummated (provided that for purposes of this clause (C),
all percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to
refer to 50%), then the Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent in
immediately available funds, prior to or concurrently with the occurrence of
the applicable event described in clause (C), the Company Termination Fee.

(iii) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01(b)(i) and at the time of such termination, all of the conditions
set forth in Section 9.01 and Section 9.02 shall have been satisfied or
validly waived (other than one or both of (x) Section 9.01(b), Section 9.01(c)
or Section 9.02(vii) (but, with respect to Section 9.01(c) and Section
9.02(vii), only if the applicable Legal Restraint or Applicable Law relates to
an Antitrust Law; provided, that if there is additionally a failure to satisfy
or waive any of Section 9.01(b), Section 9.01(c) or Section 9.02(vii) due to a
Legal Restraint or Applicable Law relating to a Specified Jurisdiction, this
subsection (x) shall nonetheless be satisfied) and (y) those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, provided that such
conditions were then capable of being satisfied if the Closing had occurred on
the date of such termination), then Parent shall pay to the Company in
immediately available funds $98,000,000 (the "Reverse Termination Fee") within
two Business Days after such termination.

(iv) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01(b)(i) and, at the time of such termination, all of the
conditions set forth in Section 9.01 and Section 9.02 shall have been
satisfied or validly waived (other than one or both of (x) Section 9.01(b),
Section 9.01(c) or Section 9.02(vii) (but, with respect to Section 9.01(c) and
Section 9.02(vii), only if the applicable Legal Restraint or Applicable Law
does not relate to an Antitrust Law and occurs in a Specified Jurisdiction)
and (y) those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, provided that such conditions were then capable of being satisfied if
the Closing had occurred on the date of such termination), then Parent shall
take the Specified Termination Actions.

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event this Agreement is terminated by
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i) and, at the time of such
termination, (i) the conditions set forth in Section 9.01(b) have been
satisfied, (ii) the conditions set forth in Section 9.01(c) and Section
9.02(vii) have been satisfied with respect to any Applicable Law or Legal
Restraint relating to Antitrust Law and (iii) the conditions set forth in
Section 9.01(vii) have been satisfied with respect to

 any Applicable Law or Legal Restraint relating to the Specified Jurisdiction,
then Parent shall neither be obligated to pay the Reverse Termination Fee or
take the Specified Termination Actions.

(c) Other Costs and Expenses. Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges and
hereby agrees that the agreements contained in this Section 11.04 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that,
without these agreements, neither party would enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if either party fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 11.04 to the other party when due, then the party failing to pay
such amounts shall also pay any costs and expenses (including attorney's fees
and expenses) incurred by the other party in connection with an Action to
enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment for such unpaid amount,
together with interest on such amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at
the prime lending rate published in The Wall Street Journal from the date such
fee, cost or expense was required to be paid to (but excluding) the payment
date.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
expressly acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company be required
to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion, and if Parent
receives the Company Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement (together with any payments required under Section 11.04(c)),
then such payment shall constitute liquidated damages and be the sole and
exclusive monetary remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the Company
Related Parties for all losses, damages, costs or expenses in respect of this
Agreement (or the termination thereof) or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (or the failure of such transactions to occur for any reason or
for no reason) or any breach (whether willful, intentional, unilateral or
otherwise) of any covenant or agreement or otherwise in respect of this
Agreement or any oral representation made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith, and upon payment of the Company Termination Fee to Parent pursuant
to Section 11.04(b) (together with any payments required under Section
11.04(c)), none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further monetary
liability or obligation to any of the Parent Related Parties relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, and none of the Parent, its Subsidiaries or any other Parent Related
Party shall seek to recover any other monetary damages; provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties will remain obligated with respect
to Section 11.04(a).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
expressly acknowledge and agree that that in no event shall Parent be required
to both (x) pay the Reverse Termination Fee and (y) take the Specified
Termination Actions and, in the case of either (x) or (y), do so on more than
one occasion. If the Company receives the Reverse Termination Fee from Parent
under circumstances where the Reverse Termination Fee is payable pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement or Parent takes the Specified Termination Actions
under circumstances where the Specified Termination Actions are to be taken
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (in each case, together with any
payments required under Section 11.04(c)), then such payment or such actions,
as applicable, shall constitute liquidated damages and shall constitute the
sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the Company Related Parties against the
Parent Related Parties for all losses, damages, costs or expenses in respect
of this Agreement (or the termination thereof) or the transactions

 contemplated by this Agreement (or the failure of such transactions to occur
for any reason or for no reason) or any breach (whether willful, intentional,
unilateral or otherwise) of any covenant or agreement or otherwise in respect
of this Agreement or any oral representation made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith, and upon payment of the Reverse Termination Fee to the
Company pursuant to Section 11.04(b)(iii) or Parent's taking of the Specified
Termination Actions pursuant to Section 11.04(b)(iv) (in each case, together
with any payments required under Section 11.04(c)), none of the Parent Related
Parties shall have any further monetary liability or obligation to any of the
Company Related Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any other Company Related Party shall seek to recover any
other monetary damages; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
parties will remain obligated with respect to Section 11.04(a). In a situation
where both the Reverse Termination Fee would be payable pursuant to Section
11.04(b)(iii) and Parent would be required to take the Specified Termination
Actions pursuant to Section 11.04(b)(iv), only the Reverse Termination Fee
will be payable and Parent shall have no obligation with respect to Section
11.04(b)(iv) or the Specified Termination Actions.

Section 11.05. Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References. The parties
agree that any reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are contained in the
corresponding Section of this Agreement and (ii) any other representations and
warranties of such party that are contained in this Agreement, but, in the
case of clause (ii), only if the relevance of that reference as an exception
to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties would
be reasonably apparent to a reasonable person who has read that reference and
such representations and warranties, without any independent knowledge on the
part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed.

Section 11.06. Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment.

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding on and, except as
provided in Section 7.03, shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their
respective successors and assigns. Except as provided in Section 7.03 and
Section 11.14, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any
rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each
other party, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign
its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time
in part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the
Effective Time, to any Person; provided that such transfer or assignment shall
not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or
enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to
Parent or Merger Subsidiary.

Section 11.07. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of

 law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction
other than those of the State of Delaware.

Section 11.08. Jurisdiction. The parties agree that any Action seeking to
enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or against any party or
any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware Chancery Court or, if
such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State
of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Action and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that you may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such Action in any such
court or that any such Action brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such Action may be served on any party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of
process on such party as provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed effective
service of process on such party.

Section 11.09. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Section 11.10. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties. Until and unless each
party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other parties, this
Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication).

Section 11.11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Schedule) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and
written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement.

Section 11.12. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 Section 11.13. Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (and
each party further agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting
of any bond in connection with such remedy).

Section 11.14. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than
the parties) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, except for: (a) solely if the Effective Time occurs,
(i) the right of the Company's stockholders to receive the Merger
Consideration, as applicable, following the Effective Time, in each case in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) the right of the holders
of Company Stock Awards and participants in the Company's ESPP to receive the
applicable treatment pursuant to Article 2 in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and (b) the provisions set forth in Section 7.03 of this
Agreement with respect to the Persons referred to therein.
