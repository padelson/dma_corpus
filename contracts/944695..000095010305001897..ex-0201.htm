  Section 2.03 _. Determination of the Adjustment._ (a) As promptly as
practicable, but no later than 30 days, after the Closing Date, Seller
will cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer a certificate (together with
a report by Milliman, Inc. (Chicago office) with respect to the calculation,
as of the Closing Date, of the VA Purchase Price Adjustment and the VUL
Purchase Price Adjustment), setting forth Sellers calculation of (i)
Adjusted Capital minus $400,000,000, _plus_ (ii) the VA Purchase Price
Adjustment, _plus_ (iii) the VUL Purchase Price Adjustment, _minus_ (iv) Post
Closing Excess Capital _minus_ (v) the Aggregate Purchase Price Adjustment
(such total amount, the "Adjustment").

 

  For purposes hereof:

 

20 
     
  

  "Adjusted Capital" means the amount equal to Adjusted Capital as set
forth on the Pro Forma Closing Balance Sheet.

 

  "Aggregate Purchase Price Adjustment" means the amount obtained by
multiplying (x) 0.15 by (y) the excess (if any) of (i) the sum of the VA
Purchase Price Adjustment and the VUL Purchase Price Adjustment over (ii)
$100,000,000.

 

  "Post Closing Excess Capital" means the excess of (x) Statutory
Adjusted Capital over (y) the Target Closing Capital Amount;  _provided_ that
if the calculation of Post Closing Excess Capital results in a negative
amount, Post Closing Excess Capital shall be deemed to be equal to zero.

 

  "Statutory Adjusted Capital" means the amount equal to Statutory
Adjusted Capital as of the Closing set forth on the Pro Forma Closing Balance
Sheet.

 

  "Target Closing Capital Amount" means the amount calculated as set
forth on Exhibit B, calculated as of the Closing Date. 

 

  "VA Purchase Price Adjustment" means the specified adjustments to the
Purchase Price to take account of certain changes in the value of the
deferred annuity business included in the Core Business between September 30,
2004 and the Closing Date, calculated as set forth on Exhibit C.

 

  "VUL Purchase Price Adjustment" means the specified adjustments to the
Purchase Price to take account of certain changes in the value of the
variable universal life business included in the Core Business between
September 30, 2004 and the Closing Date, calculated as set forth in Exhibit D.

 

  (b) Buyer and Seller agree that they will, and agree to use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective independent accountants
and actuaries and the Company to, cooperate and assist in the calculation of
the Adjustment and in the conduct of the audits, reviews and resolution of
disagreements referred to in Section 2.05, including the making available of
all related Books and Records and appropriate personnel.

 

  Section 2.04 _. Pro Forma Closing Balance Sheet._ (a) As promptly as
practicable, but no later than 30 days, after the Closing Date, Seller
will cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer a pro forma statutory
balance sheet (the "Proposed Pro Forma Closing Balance Sheet") setting forth
the assets, liabilities, surplus and other funds of the Core Business, and
reflecting adjustments to exclude the Non-Core Business and the AFC Assumed
Liabilities and AFC Transferred Assets, as of the Closing Date, which shall be
prepared on a

 

 21   
  

 basis consistent with the accounting principles, procedures, policies and
methods (including with respect to reserves) used in preparing the Pro Forma
Balance Sheet and otherwise in the manner and subject to the adjustments
set forth in Exhibit E.

 

  (b) Buyer and Seller agree that they will, and agree to use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective independent accountants
and actuaries and the Company to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of
the Proposed Pro Forma Closing Balance Sheet and the Pro Forma Closing Balance
Sheet and in the conduct of the audits, reviews and resolutions of
disagreements referred to in Section 2.05, including the making available of
all related Books and Records and appropriate personnel. "Pro Forma Closing
Balance Sheet" means the Pro Forma Closing Balance Sheet as finally
determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 2.05.

 

  Section 2.05 _. Disputes Regarding Adjustment and Pro Forma Closing
Balance Sheet._ If Buyer disputes any item reflected in the
Adjustment delivered by Seller pursuant to Section 2.03(a) or the Proposed
Pro Forma Closing Balance Sheet delivered by Seller pursuant to Section
2.04(a) (each such item, a "Disputed Item"), then Buyer and Seller shall
proceed as set forth in subsections (a) through (d) below; _provided_ that
Buyer may only dispute (i) items reflected on the Proposed Pro Forma Closing
Balance Sheet on the basis that such amounts were not determined in
accordance with the accounting principles, procedures, polices and methods
employed by Seller in preparing the Pro Forma Balance Sheet, (ii) items
reflected in the Adjustment on the basis that such amounts were not
determined in accordance with the Model)s) or the Spreadsheet(s) attached to
Exhibit C and D, respectively, or that such amounts were the result of
manifest error in the Model(s) or the Spreadsheet(s), respectively, and (iii)
items reflected on the Proposed Pro Forma Closing Balance Sheet or in the
Adjustment on the basis of arithmetic error or on the basis that the
information utilized in the preparation and calculation of the Proposed Pro
Forma Closing Balance Sheet or the Adjustment was not true and correct or not
prepared in good faith from the Books and Records of Seller.

 

  (a) Buyer shall, within 45 days after receiving the last to be received
from Seller of the Adjustment and the Proposed Pro Forma Closing Balance
Sheet, deliver a notice of disagreement to Seller. Any such notice of
disagreement must specify in reasonable detail all Disputed Items as to which
Buyer disagrees, the reasons therefor and the adjustments to such Disputed
Items that Buyer believes should be made. Buyer shall be deemed to have
agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Adjustment and in the
Proposed Pro Forma Closing Balance Sheet. Buyer and Seller shall, during the
15 days following the delivery of such notice, use their reasonable best
efforts to reach

 

 22   
  

 agreement on the Disputed Items in order to determine and agree upon the
Disputed Items.

 

  (b) If, during such 15-day period, Buyer and Seller are unable to reach
such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter submit any remaining Disputed
Items to Ernst and Young LLP or, if Ernst and Young LLP is unavailable, to one of
the other nationally recognized independent public accounting firms of
standing reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Seller (who shall not have
any material relationship with Buyer or Seller) (in either case, an
"Arbiter") for resolution in a manner consistent with the provisions of this
Agreement. Such Arbiter shall consider only those Disputed Items as to which
the parties still disagree. Such Arbiter shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, as
promptly as practicable, a report setting forth in detail its calculations,
methodologies and decision and the reasons therefor, whereupon the Adjustment
and the Proposed Pro Forma Closing Balance Sheet shall be adjusted
correspondingly. The Arbiters decision is final and binding upon Buyer and
Seller.

 

  (c) The Arbiter, in its sole discretion, shall determine (i) the nature
and extent of the participation by Buyer and Seller and their respective
independent auditors and actuaries in connection with the resolution of any
Disputed Item submitted to the Arbiter, (ii) the nature and extent of
information that Buyer and Seller may submit to the Arbiter for consideration
in connection with such resolution and (iii) the personnel of the Arbiter who
shall review such information and resolve such disagreement.

 

  (d) The cost of such review and report shall be borne by (i) Seller if
the aggregate difference between the Arbiters aggregate calculation of the
Disputed Items and Sellers aggregate calculation of the Disputed Items is
greater than the aggregate difference between the Arbiters calculation of the
Disputed Items and Buyers aggregate calculation of such Disputed Item, (ii)
by Buyer if the first such difference is less than the second such difference
and (iii) otherwise equally by Buyer and Seller.

 

  Section 2.06 _. Payment of the Adjustment._ (a) If the Estimated
Adjustment (as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.02(b)(ii), if applicable)
exceeds the Final Adjustment, Seller shall pay to Buyer, in the manner and
with interest as provided in Section 2.06(b), the amount of such excess. If
the Final Adjustment exceeds the Estimated Adjustment (as adjusted pursuant to
Section 2.02(b)(ii), if applicable), Buyer shall pay to Seller, in the manner
and with interest as provided in Section 2.06(b), the amount of such excess.

 

  (b) Any payment pursuant to Section 2.06(a) shall be made at a mutually
convenient time and place within 10 days after the Final Adjustment has been
determined by delivery by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, of a certified

 

 23   
  

 or official bank check payable in immediately available funds to the other
party or by causing such payments to be credited to such account of such other
party as may be designated by such other party. The amount of any payment
to be made pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall bear interest from and
including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per
annum equal to the "Prime Rate" as published in The Wall Street Journal,
Eastern Edition (the "Prime Rate") in effect from time to time during the
period from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Such interest shall be
payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be
calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of
days elapsed.

 

  Section 2.07. _Core Coinsurance Closing._ (a) The closing (the "Core
Coinsurance Closing") at which the transactions contemplated by the Core
Coinsurance Agreement are consummated shall take place at the location of the

Closing Date, as soon as possible, but in no event later than two Business
Days, after satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 9.04, or at
such other time or place as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree.

Core Coinsurance Closing") at which the transactions contemplated by the Non-
Core Coinsurance Agreement are consummated shall take place at the location of
the Closing, as soon as possible, but in no event later than two Business
Days, after satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 9.05, or at

 or place as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree. At the Non-Core Coinsurance
Closing, the Company and FAFLIC shall execute and deliver a Non-Core
Coinsurance Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I
(the "Non-Core Coinsurance Agreement").

 

  Section 2.09 _. AIT Merger Closing._ (a) The closing (the "AIT Merger
Closing") at which the purchase and sale of the AFIMS Shares pursuant to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the AIT Reorganization
Agreement are consummated shall take place at the location of the Closing (i)
if the conditions set forth in Section 9.06 are satisfied as of the Closing
Date, on the Closing Date, or (ii) if the conditions set forth in Section 9.06
are not satisfied as of the Closing Date, as soon as possible, but in no event
later than two Business Days, after satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in Section 9.06, or at such other time or place as Buyer and Seller may
mutually agree.

 

  (b) At the AIT Merger Closing:

>
> (i) concurrently with the transactions contemplated by the AIT
> Reorganization Agreement at the AIT Merger Closing, Seller shall deliver
> to  Buyer certificates for the AFIMS Shares duly endorsed or accompanied by

>
>  

 

  (c) If the Closing occurs simultaneously with the AIT Merger Closing,
there shall be no payment of the AIT Merger Closing Adjustment and
no adjustment to the Purchase Price as set forth in Section 2.02(c)(i)(D)
hereof.

 

  Section 2.10 _. Transfers of Certain Company Investment Assets._ (a) __
Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the Company to transfer all Excluded
Company Investment Assets to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller. Following such
transfer of the Excluded Company Investment Assets pursuant to this Section
2.10(a), each Excluded Company Investment Asset shall become the property of
Seller (or its Affiliate, as applicable) and the Company or Buyer or any of
its Affiliates shall have no right of any kind with respect to any such
Excluded Company Investment Asset. All assets transferred under this
paragraph shall be replaced with cash or Replacement Securities at the option
of Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Company Investment Assets
Backing Surplus nor the Company

 

25 
     
  

 Investment Assets Backing Reserves shall include Excluded Company Investment
Assets at the Closing..

 

  (b) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the Company to either
(i) transfer the assets identified and listed on Schedule 2.10(b) to Seller
or an Affiliate of Seller or (ii) redesignate such assets as Company
Investment Assets Backing Surplus rather than Company Investment Assets
Backing Reserves. All assets transferred under (i) shall be replaced with cash
or Replacement Securities in either case in an amount or with an aggregate
statutory book value as such value is set forth in the Companys books and
records on the date of such transfer. All assets redesignated under (ii) shall
be replaced by assets from Company Investment Assets Backing Surplus that are
either cash or Replacement Securities and have an equal aggregate statutory
book value as such value is set forth in the Companys books and records on
the date of such transfer. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of any such
transfers or redesignations.

 

  (c) After execution of the requirements of Section 2.10(a) and
2.10(b), and by 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day prior to Closing, the
parties by mutual  agreement shall designate certain Company Investment
Assets Backing Surplus  as "Lehman/IDC Assets", provided that Lehman and/or
IDC quote prices for such assets. All Company Investment Assets Backing
Surplus not designated as Lehman/IDC Assets shall be designated "Brokers
Assets." The fair market value of each Investment Assets Backing Surplus that
is a Lehman/IDC Assets and each Investment Assets Backing Surplus that is a
Brokers Asset shall be determined as follows:

 

>  
>
>   (i) No later than 9:00 a.m. on  the Business Day immediately prior
> to the Closing Date, Buyer shall submit  simultaneously to each of Lehman
> and IDC the CUSIP number (or other unique  identifier if CUSIP is not
> available) and face amount of each Lehman/IDC Asset  and request that
> Lehman and IDC provide as promptly as possible to Buyer each  such assets
> price (for the given face amount) as of approximately 3:00  p.m. on such
> Business Day. Upon receipt thereof, Buyer shall then communicate  each such
> price to Seller no later than 9:00 a.m. on the Closing Date. The  price
> quoted by Lehman and/or IDC for each Lehman/IDC Asset shall be referred  to
> as the "Lehman Index Price" and the "IDC Price",  respectively.
>
>  
>
> (ii) No later than 5:00 p.m. on the fourth Business Day prior to the
> Closing Date, Buyer shall submit simultaneously to each of three Brokers 
> the CUSIP number (or other unique identifier if CUSIP is not available) and
> face amount of each Brokers Asset and request that each Broker provide as
> promptly as possible to Buyer each such assets price (for the given face
> amount), with such  price setting forth the bid value and
>
>  

 

26 
     
  

>  
>
>   ask value of each such asset as of approximately 3:00 p.m. on the
> Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date. Upon receipt thereof,
> Buyer shall then communicate each such price to Seller no later than 9:00
> a.m. on the  Closing Date. The price quoted by each Broker for each Brokers
> Asset shall be the average of such bid and ask price and shall be designated
> as the "Brokers Quote" for each  such Brokers Asset.
>
>  
>
> (iii) Immediately upon communication thereof from Buyer to Seller,
> Seller and Buyer together shall review the Lehman Index Prices, IDC Prices 
> and Brokers Quotes for any errors and omissions or other disagreements
> (together, "Disagreements"). If Seller or Buyer discovers any Disagreement,
> Seller and Buyer shall  immediately notify Lehman, IDC or the applicable
> Broker, as the case may be, and use their reasonable best efforts to
> determine and resolve with the applicable party any such Disagreement prior
> to the Closing, or as promptly as possible after the  Closing, in
> accordance with the principles set forth in this Section 2.10.
>
>  
>
> (iv) With respect to each Lehman/IDC Asset, if: (x) the Lehman Index
> Price is available, then such price shall be its fair market value, (y) if 
> the Lehman Index Price is unavailable but the IDC Price is available, then
> the IDC price shall be its fair market value. The fair market value of each
> Brokers Asset is the Brokers Quote remaining for such asset after
> discarding the highest and  lowest Brokers Quote for such asset. Such fair
> market values for the Lehman/IDC and Brokers Assets shall be referred to as
> the "Fair Market Value" of such asset.
>
>  

 

  (d) After execution of the requirements of Sections 2.10(a) and 2.10(b)
and after determination of the Fair Market Value of the Lehman/IDC Assets and
Brokers Assets pursuant to Section 2.10(c), Buyer shall have the right to
submit to Seller, no later than 11:00 a.m. on the Closing Date, a list of
Lehman/IDC Assets and/or Brokers Assets (the "Buyers Swap List" and each
asset so listed, a "Buyer Swap Asset") and request that Seller, and Seller
shall promptly, transfer each Buyer Swap Asset to Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller for an amount in cash equal to the Fair Market Value of such Buyer Swap
Asset to be paid to the Company by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller; 
_provided_ that Buyer shall only have the right to request such transfers of
Buyer Swap Assets having an aggregate Fair Market Value not greater than
$35,000,000. If the Buyers Swap List includes assets having an aggregate
Fair Market Value in excess of $35,000,000, Seller shall have the right to
choose the Buyer Swap Assets to be transferred for cash under this Section
2.10(d) so that the aggregate Fair Market Value of all transferred assets
will be as close as possible to, but not in excess of, $35,000,000. Following
the transfer of any Buyer Swap Asset in accordance with this Section 2.10(d),
such Buyer Swap Asset shall become the property of Seller (or its Affiliate,
as applicable), and the Company or Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall

 

27 
     
  

 have no right of any kind with respect to such Buyer Swap Asset. For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Buyers Swap List contains a Buyer Swap Asset
pursuant to this Section 2.10(d) and Seller designates the same security as
a Seller Swap Asset pursuant to Section 2.10(e), then each of Seller and
Buyer shall count the Fair Market Value of such asset towards the Fair Market
Value limit of $35,000,000 set forth herein.

 

  (e) After execution of the requirements of Section 2.10(a) and 2.10(b)
and after determination of the Fair Market Value of the Lehman/IDC Assets and
Brokers Assets pursuant to Section 2.10(c), Seller shall have the right to
submit to Buyer, no later than 11:00 a.m. on the Closing Date, a list of
Lehman/IDC Assets and/or Brokers Assets (the "Sellers Swap List" and each
asset so listed, a "Seller Swap Asset"). Seller shall promptly transfer any
Seller Swap Asset to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller for an amount in cash
equal to the Fair Market Value of such Seller Swap Asset to be paid to the
Company by Seller; _provided_ that Seller shall only have the right to effect
such transfers of Seller Swap Assets having an aggregate Fair Market Value not
greater than $35,000,000. If the Sellers Swap List includes assets having an
aggregate Fair Market Value in excess of $35,000,000, Buyer shall have the
right to choose the Seller Swap Assets to be transferred for cash under this
Section 2.10(e) so that an aggregate Fair Market Value of all
transferred assets will be as close as possible to, but not in excess of,
$35,000,000. Following the transfer of any Seller Swap Asset in accordance
with this Section 2.10(e), such Seller Swap Asset shall become the property of
Seller (or its Affiliate, as applicable), and the Company or Buyer or any of
its Affiliates shall have no right of any kind with respect to such Seller
Swap Asset. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Sellers Swap List contains a
Seller Swap Asset pursuant to this Section 2.10(e) and Buyer designates the
same asset as a Buyer Swap Asset pursuant to Section 2.10(d), then each of
Seller and Buyer shall count the Fair Market Value of such asset towards the
Fair Market Value limit of $35,000,000 set forth herein. 

 

  (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any
of the Ancillary Agreements, the transactions contemplated by this Section
2.10 shall be deemed to take effect in all respects and for all purposes
(including determining the time of transfer of the benefits and risks of
ownership and which party is obligated to pay the Tax Liabilities in
connection with such transfers, swaps or redesignations) as of immediately
prior to the Closing regardless of the actual date and time of, without
limitation delivery of assets and the related cash transfers or of the
performance of other ministerial tasks (including with respect to the Buyer
Swap Assets and the Seller Swap Assets), it being understood that, for the
avoidance of doubt, all Tax Liabilities in connection with such transfers,
swaps and redesignations shall be for the account of, and be borne
by, Seller.

Closing and (y) the cash dividend from FAFLIC to Seller of at least the amount

Amount") between (A) the aggregate amount payable to Seller pursuant
to clauses (x) and (y) above and (B) the aggregate amount of cash dividends

clause (y) above shall be paid at the Core Coinsurance Closing. 

 

  (b) If Buyer pays Seller the FAFLIC Dividend Shortfall Amount, then

Contracts and other transactions and actions of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. The Books and Records of Seller and its Affiliates (other than
the Company and AFIMS) (in each case to the extent related to the Core
Business and the Funds Business) and of the Company and of AFIMS, in each
case set forth on Schedule 3.08(c) are generally maintained in accordance with
reasonable business practices, in compliance with any record-keeping

Agreement or for any other reasonable purpose (including for audit,
accounting, regulatory, investigation, dispute or litigation purposes and for
fulfilling disclosure and reporting obligations) relating to the Company, the
Business or the Funds Business, as applicable; _provided_ that any such access
by Buyer shall not interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of

right of indemnification the  Company has under a Producer Agreement.
Thereafter, Seller shall use commercially  reasonable efforts (at Buyers
expense) to ensure that upon any such  dissolution, merger or other corporate
reorganization that any rights of  the Company to indemnification under such

are assignable.

Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, and shall use

Affiliates, it being understood that Seller may use such information to defend
against a claim by Buyer or in a claim against Buyer, any confidential
written, oral or other information of the Company or relating to the Core
Business or the Funds Business, as applicable, or any confidential information

known on a non-confidential basis by Seller or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives, other than related to the prior ownership of the Company,
the Core Business, or Funds Business, as applicable, or any such information
becomes publicly available, other than because of a disclosure by

 

69    
      

  Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives in violation of this
Agreement, (ii) any such information is required to be disclosed by applicable
Law or by Order of any Governmental Entity, (iii) such information is
later acquired by Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives from
sources other than those related to their prior ownership of the Company, the
Core Business, or the Funds Business, as applicable, (iv) use of such
information is necessary or appropriate in making any filing or obtaining any
consent required for the consummation of the Transactions, or (v) in
connection with the defense of claims pursuant to Article 10 or otherwise.
Seller shall instruct its Representatives and the Representatives of its
Affiliates having access to such information of such obligation of
confidentiality. Seller shall be responsible for any failure by its Affiliates
to comply with this Section 5.07.

 

  Section 5.08 _. Employee Matters._ (a) Seller will provide Buyer with
a list of all Employee Plans (along with a copy of such plan,
underlying award agreements and any summary explanations) covering those
employees of Seller and its Affiliates to whom Buyer may make offers of
employment pursuant to the employee side letter agreement entered into on the
date hereof.

 

  (b) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Seller and its
Affiliates will consult with Buyer and provide Buyer a meaningful
opportunity to review and comment on any employee communication or
announcement with respect to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the
Transactions, which relates to employment opportunities with, or compensation
or benefits to be provided by, Buyer or its Affiliates after the Closing
Date, prior to issuing such communication or announcement.

 

  Section 5.09 _. Transfer/Novation of Transferred Agreements._ (a)  It
is the intent of the parties hereto that, to the extent practicable,  the
Company obtain and assume the economic and legal rights and obligations, as
applicable, under the Contracts identified on Schedule 5.09 (the "Transferred
Agreements").

 

  (b) On and after the date hereof, subject to Section 5.09(d) below,
Seller shall, and shall cause FAFLIC and VeraVest (to the extent
necessary) to cooperate with Buyer and the Company to take the actions set
forth on Schedule 5.09 and such other actions as Buyer may reasonably request
(but in each case without any obligation to make payments or incur any
liabilities to any counterparty to any Transferred Agreement), in order to
transfer economic and legal rights and obligations under the Transferred
Agreements to the Company.

 

  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no rights of Seller or its
Affiliates under such Transferred Agreement (including with respect
to indemnification matters) not relating to the Core Business shall be
limited by such transfer, (ii) neither Buyer nor the Company shall commence or
defend any Action against or

 

70    
      

  by a counterparty to a Transferred Agreement with respect to any
indemnification obligation reserved to Seller pursuant to Section 5.09(d); and
(iii) Buyer shall not settle any Action with respect to any such Transferred
Agreement in any way that would limit any rights or create any obligation of
Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 

  (d) Other than as set forth in Section 5.09(b), Seller shall retain
control over any indemnification claims under the Producer Agreements; 
_provided_ that if Seller has an indemnity obligation to Buyer under Article
10 with respect to the matter covered by such indemnification claims, Seller
shall, and shall cause FAFLIC and VeraVest to, pay to Buyer any recoveries up
to the amount of the indemnification obligation under Article 10 from the
counterparty to a Producer Agreement under the Producer Agreement (arising as
a result of an indemnification proceeding), net of any expenses and Losses
incurred by Seller and its Affiliates in connection with such indemnification
proceeding. The amount of any such payment actually made by Seller shall not
reduce the amount of the $5,000,000 deductible set forth in
Section 10.02(a)(iii)(B) .

 

  Section 5.10. _Third Party Reinsurance._ (a)  Seller shall cause
FAFLIC to use commercially reasonable efforts to assign  to the Company,
effective as of the date of the Core Coinsurance Closing  and subject to the
occurrence of the Core Coinsurance Closing, all of FAFLICs  rights and
obligations under the reinsurance treaties to which it is a party  that are
related to the Contract Liabilities (as defined in the Core Coinsurance 
Agreement) and listed on Schedule 5.10(a)(i) hereto (the "FAFLIC Reinsurance
Agreements"),  and to obtain any endorsements from the reinsurers thereunder
to the extent  necessary to ensure that the Company is entitled to enforce
the FAFLIC Reinsurance  Agreements (with respect to the Core Business)
against the reinsurers in  its own name, and on behalf of FAFLIC and that all
payments under such agreements,  for the benefit of either FAFLIC (with
respect to the Core Business) or  the Company (with respect to the Core
Business) are to be paid directly  to the Company; _provided_ that Seller and
its Affiliates shall be  under no obligation to make payments or incur other
liabilities to any counterparty  to such FAFLIC Reinsurance Agreements in
connection with such assignments  and endorsements. If FAFLIC is unable to
obtain such assignments or endorsements  prior to the Core Coinsurance
Closing, Seller shall cause FAFLIC to place  the Company in the same net
economic position as if such assignments or  endorsements had been obtained
(which actions may consist of FAFLIC continuing  to use commercially
reasonable efforts at the Companys expense to  enforce its rights under such
FAFLIC Reinsurance Agreements (with respect  to the Core Business) by
ensuring that all benefits and burdens thereunder flow to the Company).

 

  (b) Seller  shall, and shall cause FAFLIC to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to  assign or rewrite to the Company, effective as of the
Closing Date and subject to the occurrence of the Closing, all of FAFLICs
rights and

 

71    
      

  obligations under the reinsurance treaties to  which it is a party that
are related to the Core Business, listed on Schedule  5.10(a)(ii) hereto (the
"Company  Reinsurance Agreements"),  and to obtain any endorsements and
consents from the third party reinsurers  thereunder to the extent necessary
to ensure that the Company is entitled  to enforce the Company Reinsurance
Agreements (with respect to the Core  Business) against such third party
reinsurers in its own name and on behalf  of FAFLIC and that all payments
under such agreements, for the benefit of  either FAFLIC (with respect to the
Core Business) or the Company (with respect  to the Core Business) are to be
paid directly to the Company; _provided_ that  Seller and its Affiliates
shall be under no obligation to make payments  to or incur other liabilities
to any counterparty to such Company Reinsurance  Agreements in connection
with such assignments and endorsements. If FAFLIC  is unable to obtain such
assignments or endorsements prior to the Closing,  Seller shall cause FAFLIC
to place the Company in the same net economic  position as if such
assignments or endorsements had been obtained (which  actions may consist of
FAFLIC continuing to use commercially reasonable  efforts at the Companys
expense to enforce its rights under such Company Reinsurance Agreements (with
respect to  the Core Business) and ensuring that all benefits and burdens
thereunder  flow to the Company). In no event will FAFLIC have any liability
to the  Company in excess of the amount it has received from the third party
reinsurers under the Company Reinsurance Agreements.

 

  Section 5.11 _. Final Scheduled Portfolio._ Seller  shall, promptly
after the Closing Date, provide Buyer with a schedule to  be prepared in
accordance with the principles and methodologies set forth  in Schedule
3.15(b) and giving effect to the transactions contemplated by  Section 2.10

Scheduled Portfolio"), containing information with respect to each such
Company Investment Asset as to (A) par value, (B) interest rate, (C) statutory
book value, (D) statutory book yield, (E) Tax Basis, (F) cost basis, (G) any
credit rating as assigned by Moodys Investor Service, Inc., Standard and
Poors and/or the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, (H) trade
and settlement date, (I) maturity date, and (J) whether each such Company
Investment Asset is owned by the Company or FAFLIC, in each case as of the
Closing Date.

 

  Section 5.12 _. AFIMS Release._ Except as expressly required by this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, effective as of the date of the
AIT Merger Closing, AFIMS, on the one hand, and Seller and each Seller
Retained Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall release and forever discharge
the other party and its Affiliates, and its respective directors, officers,
employees and agents of and from all Liabilities against such other Person or
any of its assigns which the releasing person has or ever had arising out of
or relating to events, circumstances or actions taken by such other Person
prior to the date of the AIT Merger Closing;

 

72    
      

  _provided_ that  the foregoing release shall not affect either Persons
right to enforce any Ancillary Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 

  Section 5.13 _. Discharge of AFIMS Liabilities._ (a) Seller will, and
will cause AFIMS to, take such actions as are necessary so that, as of the
AIT Merger Closing, AFIMS will have no assets or other properties and will
have no Liabilities.

 

  (b) Seller  will, and will cause AFIMS to, prepare, and deliver to
Buyer, promptly after  the date of the AIT Merger Closing, a stand-alone
balance sheet of AFIMS  as of the date of the AIT Merger Closing giving
effect to the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and any of the
Ancillary Agreements (the "AFIMS Closing Balance Sheet"). The AFIMS Closing
Balance Sheet will present fairly, in  all material respects, the financial
position of AFIMS as of the dates therein  specified in conformity with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as
required by GAAP).

  COVENANTS  OF BUYER

 

 Buyer  agrees that:

 

 

  Section 6.01 _. Confidentiality._ (a) Prior to the Closing Date and

written, oral and other information concerning Seller and its Affiliates,
furnished to Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements or the Transactions in accordance with the terms (other

  obligation of confidentiality. Buyer shall be responsible for any failure
by its Affiliates to comply with this Section 6.01.

 

  Section 6.02 _. Access._ Buyer  shall, and shall cause the Company
and its Affiliates, on and after the  Closing Date, to (i) afford promptly to
Seller and its Affiliates and their  respective Representatives reasonable

to the extent necessary to permit Seller to  determine any matter relating to
its rights and obligations hereunder or  under any Ancillary Agreement or for
any other reasonable purpose (including  for audit, accounting, regulatory,
investigation, dispute or litigation  purposes and for fulfilling disclosure
and reporting obligations); _provided_ that  any such access by Seller shall
not unreasonably interfere with the conduct  of the business of Buyer. Seller
shall bear all of the out-of-pocket costs  and expenses (including attorneys
fees, but excluding reimbursement for general overhead, salaries and employee
benefits) reasonably incurred by Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with
the foregoing. For avoidance of doubt, the foregoing obligation shall include
Buyer using its reasonable best efforts to make reasonably available, upon
Sellers written request, Buyers and its Affiliates Representatives as
witnesses.

 

  Section 6.03 _. Buyer Tax Covenants._ (a)  Buyer covenants that,
without Sellers consent, it will not cause or  permit the Company or any
Affiliate of Buyer to take any action on the Closing  Date, other than in the
ordinary course of business, including the distribution  of any dividend or
the effectuation of any redemption that would give rise  to any Tax liability
or reduce any Tax Asset of the Seller Group or give rise to any Loss of the
Seller or the Seller Group under this Agreement.

 

  (b) Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to Seller all refunds
of Taxes and interest received by Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or
the Company attributable to Taxes paid by Seller, the Company or any

entitled to such refund under Section 8.01 hereof.

 

  (c) Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to elect, where
permitted by applicable Law, to carry forward any Tax Asset that
would, absent such election, be carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period in
which the Company or any Subsidiary was included in a consolidated, combined
or unitary Tax return filed by Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 

74    
      

  (d) Buyer agrees to make an election under Revenue Ruling 2005-6 to
enter into a closing agreement to the extent requested to do so by Seller, 
_provided_ that Seller fully reimburses Buyer for all costs relating to making
such election, other than the cost of salaries and benefits of employees of
Buyer.

 

  Section 6.04 _. Investment Advisor Restrictions._ Buyer hereby
covenants and agrees that, until the third anniversary of the Closing Date,
for so long as the AIT Merger Closing has not occurred, Buyer will pay to
Seller the AIT Merger Closing Adjustment if, at any time prior to the earlier
of (x) the third anniversary of the Closing Date and (y) the date of the AIT
Merger Closing, Buyer or any of its Affiliates enters, directly or
indirectly, into any investment advisory or sub-advisory agreement with
respect to any AIT Fund other than any such agreement entered into with AFIMS
(but only if such agreement were entered into at a time when AFIMS is an
Affiliate of Seller)

 

 

ARTICLE 7 
  COVENANTS  OF BUYER AND SELLER

 

 Buyer  and Seller agree that:

 

 

  Section 7.01 _. Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances._ (a)
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller
shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable
under applicable Laws and Orders to promptly satisfy the conditions to the
Closing, the Core Coinsurance Closing, the Non Core Coinsurance Closing and
the AIT Merger Closing, as applicable, and to promptly consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
including the obtaining of the approvals of the Insurance Regulators of the
jurisdictions where such approval is required and, with respect to the
transactions to occur at the consummation of the AIT Reorganization Agreement,
of the other Governmental Entities having jurisdiction over such
transactions, and Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, execute and deliver such other documents, certificates,
agreements and other writings and to take such other actions as may be
necessary or desirable in order to consummate or implement expeditiously the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. This
obligation shall include if requested by the DOI (i) in the case of Buyer,
entering into a keepwell with the DOI with respect to the Company effective
as of the Closing the terms of which shall be substantially similar to the
terms of the Keepwell, except that it shall be in an amount up to or equal to
(but under no circumstances exceeding) $350,000,000 and (ii) in the case
of Seller, entering into a keepwell with the DOI with respect to FAFLIC which
shall be effective as of the Closing and the terms of which shall be
substantially similar to those of the Keepwell. Notwithstanding

 

75    
      

  anything to the contrary contained herein, (1) neither Buyer nor Seller
shall be required to take or commit or agree to take, or to refrain from
taking or commit or agree to refrain from taking, any action that would
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (2) neither
Buyer nor Seller nor any of their Affiliates shall be required to take or
commit or agree to take, or to refrain from taking or commit or agree to
refrain from taking, any action in connection with satisfying the conditions
to the Closing, the Core Coinsurance Closing or the AIT Merger Closing that
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially
impair the benefits such party reasonably expects to obtain in connection
with the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements _; provided_ that Buyer and Seller acknowledge that Buyer not being
permitted to use the Buyer Hedging Arrangements for SAP purposes or the
imposition by the DOI on Buyer of a keepwell in excess of $350,000,000 shall
constitute a material impairment of the benefits Buyer reasonably expects to
obtain in connection with the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements, and (3) neither Buyer nor Seller nor any of their
Affiliates shall be required to take or commit or agree to take, or to refrain
from taking or commit or agree to refrain from taking, any action in
connection with satisfying the conditions to the Non-Core Coinsurance Closing
that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result
in any non-immaterial adverse effect (with respect to the net Liabilities
being transferred at the Non-Core Coinsurance Closing) on such party or any
of its Affiliates.

 

  (b) In  furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, and
subject to Section  7.05 and the parties further obligations with
respect to consummating the AIT Merger Closing as set forth in the AIT
Reorganization  Agreement, each of Buyer and Seller shall (i) make an
appropriate filing  of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR
Act, of a Form A with  the DOI (it being understood, for the avoidance of
doubt, that such Form  A or any drafts thereof previously made available to
the DOI on an informal  basis may disclose the Non-Core Coinsurance Agreement
and the transactions  contemplated thereby) and of such other filings and
documents as are required  by the DOI and the New York and other state
Insurance Regulators in connection  with the Closing, the Core Coinsurance
Closing and the Non-Core Coinsurance  Closing, in each case as promptly as
practicable and in any event within  ten Business Days after the date hereof

Coinsurance Closing, which shall be filed  within 10 Business Days after the
Core Coinsurance Closing or at such earlier  time as agreed by the parties),
(ii) supply as promptly as practicable any  additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant  to the HSR Act or by any
Insurance Regulator and (iii) subject to Section  7.01(a), take all other
actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination  of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable; _it being
understood_ that, as provided in Section 12.03(b), Buyer and Seller shall
each pay 50% of (A) the filing and other fees (other than

 

76    
      

  attorneys fees) relating to the Notification and Report Form pursuant to
the HSR Act and (B) the filing and other fees (other than attorneys  fees)
relating to the submission and review of the Form A and any other filings and
documents to the DOI or any other Governmental Entity.

 

  (c) Buyer and Seller will use their reasonable best efforts, and will
cooperate fully with each other, to obtain all consents or waivers of third
parties set forth on Schedule 7.01(c) . As provided in Section 12.03(b), Buyer
and Seller shall each pay 50% of the aggregate amount of any payments to
counterparties with respect to obtaining the consents or waivers of such
counterparties;  _provided_ that,  as set forth in Section 12.03(b), Buyer
shall reimburse Seller for 100%  of any such payments to vendors identified
on Schedule 7.01(c) (such payments,  the "New Vendor Payments") that will
provide long term services to the Company after the Closing.

 

  Section 7.02 _. Certain Filings._ (a) Seller and Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate with one another (i) in determining whether any action by
or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required, or any
actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from
parties to any material contracts, in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) in taking such actions
or making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection
therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals
or waivers.

 

  (b) Each party shall have the right to review in advance, subject to
applicable Law and Orders, any filing made by the other party with, or other
written materials submitted by such other party to, any such third party or
any such Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Each party shall consult with
the other party about the status of any consents required to be obtained by
such party from any third party or any such Governmental Entity in connection
with the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly provide
to Seller copies of all filings, submissions and correspondence made to or
received from any such Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions
contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements (and the substance
thereof, to the extent relating to the Transactions). Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, promptly provide to Buyer copies of all filings,
submissions and correspondence made to or received from any such
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and by the Ancillary Agreements. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of
Buyer and Seller shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Buyer
and Seller agree that they will keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the Transactions.

 

77    
      

  Section 7.03 _. Public Announcements._ The parties agree to consult
with each other before issuing any press release or making any
public statement with respect to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or
the Transactions contemplated hereby and, except for any press releases and
public announcements the making of which may be required by applicable Law or
Order or any listing agreement with any national securities exchange, will
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation.

 

  Section 7.04 _. Intercompany Arrangements._ (a)  To the fullest
extent practicable, Seller shall cause all outstanding intercompany  accounts
between Seller or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company,  on the
other hand, to be settled (irrespective of the terms of payment of  such
intercompany accounts) immediately prior to the Closing. Any Intercompany 
Balances remaining outstanding after the Closing, as applicable, shall be 
paid within 30 (thirty) days of the Closing. "Intercompany Balances" means 
aggregate payables of the Company, to Seller and its Affiliates outstanding 
immediately after the Closing minus aggregate receivables of the
Company, from Seller and its Affiliates outstanding immediately after the
Closing.

 

  (b) Subject to Section 5.10(b), Seller shall cause all intercompany
agreements (other than those set forth in Schedule 7.04(b)) between Seller or
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company or AFIMS, as applicable, on
the other hand, to be terminated, or to provide for an unconditional, full and
permanent release of the Company, immediately prior to the Closing, and of
AFIMS, immediately prior to the AIT Merger Closing. After such termination or
release, neither the Company, AFIMS nor any Affiliate of the Company, shall
have any further rights or obligations under such terminated agreements,
except to the extent of any accruals reflected on the Pro Forma Closing
Balance Sheet.

 

  (c) Without limiting the provisions of Section 7.04(b), any and all
existing Tax sharing agreements between the Company or AFIMS, as applicable,
and any member of the Seller Group (including the Tax Sharing Agreement) shall
be terminated immediately prior to the Closing or the AIT Merger Closing, as
applicable. After such termination, neither the Company, AFIMS, Seller nor
any Affiliate of Seller shall have any further rights or liabilities
thereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, neither Seller nor any Affiliate of
Seller shall be liable to make any payments after the Closing Date or the date
of the AIT Merger Closing, as applicable, pursuant to the Tax Sharing
Agreement or otherwise with respect to the use by the Seller Group of Tax
Assets of the Company and the Company shall not be liable to make any payments
after the Closing Date or the date of the AIT Merger Closing, as applicable,

reasonable best efforts to obtain, and Buyer agrees  to use its reasonable
best efforts to cooperate in obtaining, such authorizations  and approvals of
(1) the board of trustees of AIT (including any separate  approvals of
trustees who are not Interested Persons) with respect to each  Registered
Fund and (2) the shareholders of each Registered Fund, as may  be reasonably
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by the  AIT
Reorganization Agreement (the "Fund Approvals"). Buyer agrees to provide such
information, for provision to the board of trustees of each Registered Fund
and for inclusion in a proxy statement to the shareholders thereof, as may be
reasonably required. Seller and Buyer shall expeditiously use reasonable
best efforts, and shall reasonably cooperate in furtherance of (i) Buyers
obligation to cause to be prepared and filed with the SEC, declared effective
by the SEC, and mailed to the shareholders of each Registered Fund,
prospectus/proxy statements for the transactions contemplated by the AIT
Reorganization Agreement, such proxy statements/prospectuses to contain all
required information and disclosures and to be subject to Sellers review and
approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and (ii)
Sellers obligation to cause special meetings of the shareholders of the
Registered Funds to be called to vote on such approval.

 

  (b) Buyer  shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, and
Seller agrees to use  its reasonable best efforts to cooperate in obtaining,
such authorizations  and approvals of the board of trustees of GSVIT
(including any separate  approvals of trustees who are not Interested
Persons) with respect to each  GSVIT Fund, as may be reasonably required to
consummate the transactions  contemplated by the AIT Reorganization Agreement
(the "GSVIT Fund Approvals").  Seller agrees to provide such information for
provision to the board of trustees of each GSVIT Fund, as may be reasonably
required.

 

  Section 7.06 _. Non-Core Business._ (a) After the Closing, and without
duplication of any amounts actually paid by FAFLIC to the Company pursuant to
the Non-Core Coinsurance Agreement, (i) Seller shall indemnify the Company in
respect of all Liabilities, whenever arising, resulting from, arising out of
or relating to the Non-Core Business (including for the avoidance of doubt,
any reserves (or increases thereof) required by SAP to be established by the
Company) to the extent provided in Section 10.02(a)(ii), and (ii) the Company
shall pay in cash to Seller any economic benefits, including all revenues,
profits, interest (including on reserves), income and appreciation, dividends
and distributions, proceeds of any dispositions, sale, co-insurance,
reinsurance or liquidation, whenever arising, resulting from, arising out of
or relating to the Non-Core Business. The parties shall cooperate in good
faith to develop reasonable mechanics for the periodic calculation (including
netting and offsetting) and payment of the net cash amount of such Liabilities
and economic benefits all as set forth in the Non-Core Administrative
Services Agreement; _provided_ that, in

 

79    
      

  furtherance of the foregoing, in the event the Company is required by SAP
to establish any reserve or increase any such reserve related to the Non-Core
Business, then Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of the amount of
such reserve or increase thereof, as applicable, and Seller then shall
promptly pay the Company such amounts in cash.

 

  (b) Seller  agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to assist Buyer
and the Company  after the Closing Date, at the reasonable request of Buyer
and at Buyers  sole cost and expense, to affect the assumption reinsurance
by third parties  of the blocks of run-off non-indemnity medical and
disability businesses set forth in Schedule 3.15(e) .

 

  Section 7.07 _. Reserves, Accruals and Recoveries._ Upon  the
occurrence of any event which, in accordance with SAP, would allow release 
of any reserves or accruals for contingent liabilities set forth on the  Pro
Forma Closing Balance Sheet (including reserves for Actions set forth  in
paragraphs 1 through 3 on Schedule 7.07 hereto), which reserves or accruals 
were reflected in the calculation of the Purchase Price and with respect  to
which Seller has indemnification obligations to Buyer pursuant to Article 
10, whether related to the Core Business or the Non-Core Business (the
"Reserves"),  Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller the difference between the
amount of  the applicable Reserve plus interest per annum at LIBOR from and
including  the date of such permitted release to but not including the date
of payment  and the amount of damages actually incurred by Buyer or the
Company (and  not otherwise reimbursed to the Company or its Affiliates by
Seller or any  third party) resulting from the liability with respect to
which such Reserve  has been established. With respect to the recoveries and
other matters (including  those that would relieve the Company of projected
expenses) set forth on  Schedule 7.07, the parties shall pay each other in
cash as set forth on,  and shall otherwise comply with, Schedule 7.07. Buyer
shall provide a written  report to Seller of any material developments with
respect to any Reserve  no later than 30 days after the end of each calendar
quarter. In furtherance  of the foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt, in the
event the Company is  required under SAP to establish any reserve or increase
any such reserve,  then Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of the amount of
such reserve or  increase thereof, as applicable, and Seller then shall
promptly pay Buyer such amounts in cash.

 

  Section 7.08 _. Post-Closing Requirement._ Buyer  shall from and
after the Closing Date (i) use reasonable best efforts so  that, for a period
of three years after the Closing Date, at least 75% of  the board of
directors or trustees of each Registered Fund or any permitted  successor
thereto are not Interested Persons of Buyer or Seller, and (ii)  refrain from
imposing or seeking to impose, for a period of two years after  the Closing
Date, any "unfair burden" on any Registered Fund or any permitted successor
thereto, within the meaning of the Investment

 

80

its Affiliates to, retain all information relating  to the other partys
business and operations in accordance with the then general practice of such
party with respect to information relating to its own business and
operations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise prohibited by

information relating to the other partys business and operations at any
time, _provided_ that, prior to such destruction or disposal, (i) such party
shall provide not less than 90 calendar days prior written notice to the
other party, specifying the information proposed to be destroyed or disposed
of and the scheduled date for such destruction or disposal, and (ii) if the
recipient of such notice shall request in writing prior to the scheduled date
for such destruction or disposal that any of the information proposed to be
destroyed or disposed of be delivered to such requesting party, the
party proposing the

 

81    
      

  destruction or disposal shall promptly arrange for the delivery of such of
the information as was requested at the expense of the requesting party.

 

  Section 7.11 _. Cooperation for Post-Closing Administrator._ (a) 
Subject to Buyers reimbursement obligations set forth in Section 12.03(b),

suitable Post-Closing Administrator, (ii) delineating the scope and terms  of
the services and the service levels required by Buyer with respect to  the
categories of services currently provided by Seller or its Affiliates  with
respect to the Core Business, and (iii) cooperating with the Post-Closing 
Administrator and Buyer during the process of converting the existing
operations  and systems relating to the Core Business to the operations and
systems  of the Post-Closing Administrator, including coordinating the
services to  be provided by Seller and its Affiliates pursuant to the
Transition Services  Agreement with the services to be provided by the Post-
Closing Administrator under the Post-Closing TPA.

 

  (b) In connection with the foregoing, Seller shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, (i) give Buyer and its Representatives and the Post-
Closing Administrator reasonable access to the offices, properties, Books and
Records and Representatives of Seller and its Affiliates, (ii) furnish to
Buyer and its Representatives and the Post-Closing Administrator such
information as Buyer may reasonably request and (iii) instruct the
Representatives of Seller and its Affiliates to cooperate with Buyer and the
Post-Closing Administrator, in each case to the extent necessary for the
cooperation and assistance set forth in clause (a) above and only after such
Post-Closing Administrator shall have agreed to non-solicitation and no-hire
provisions with respect to employees of Seller and its Affiliates that are
substantially similar to those applicable to Buyer and its
Affiliates hereunder.

 

  Section 7.12 _. Tax Structure._ Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in any of the Ancillary  Agreements or
in any other written or oral understanding or agreement to  which the Seller
and Buyer (or their respective Affiliates) are parties  or by which they are
bound, each of the Seller and Buyer (and their respective  Affiliates)
authorizes each other (and Representatives of each of the Seller,  Buyer and
of their respective Affiliates) to disclose to any Person, without 
limitation of any kind, the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (within  the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011 -4) of the Transactions  or of

with the accounting principles, procedures, policies and methods used to
produce the Pro Forma Balance Sheet and with SAP and (ii) cause the Post-
Effective Date Accounting and the Proposed Post-Effective Date Accounting to
comply, _mutatis mutandis_ , in all respects with Sellers financial and
reserves representations set forth in Section 3.08 and Section 3.32,

  ARTICLE 8 
 LIABILITY FOR TAXES AND RELATED MATTERS

 

  Section 8.01 _. Liability for Taxes._ (a)  Except to the extent
treated as a liability in the calculation of the Statutory  Adjusted Capital,
Seller shall be liable for and indemnify Buyer for all  Taxes (including,
without limitation, any obligation to contribute to the  payment of a tax
determined on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis  with respect to a
group of corporations that includes or included the Company  or AFIMS and
Taxes resulting from the Company or AFIMS ceasing to be a member  of the
Sellers Group), (i) imposed on the Seller Group (other than  the Company or
AFIMS) for any taxable year, (ii) imposed on the Company  or AFIMS or for
which the Company or AFIMS may otherwise be liable for any  taxable year or
period that ends on or before the Closing Date and, with  respect to any
taxable year or period beginning before and ending after  the Closing Date,
the portion of such taxable year ending on and including  the Closing Date.
Except to the extent treated as an asset in the calculation  of the Statutory
Adjusted Capital, Seller shall be entitled to any refund  of Taxes of the
Company or AFIMS for any tax period or portion thereof ending on or before
the Closing Date or for which Seller was otherwise responsible.

 

  (b) Except to the extent arising from a breach of representation or
covenant of the Seller or from obligations set forth herein or in
the Coinsurance Agreement, Buyer shall be liable for and indemnify Seller for
the Taxes of the Company and AFIMS for any taxable year or period that begins
after the Closing Date and, with respect to any taxable year or period
beginning before and ending after the Closing Date, the portion of such
taxable year beginning after the Closing Date. Buyer shall be entitled to any
refund of Taxes of the Company and AFIMS received for such periods.

 

  (c) For purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b), whenever it is necessary
to determine the liability for Taxes of the Company or AFIMS for a portion of
a taxable year or period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date,
the

 

83    
      

  determination of the Taxes of the Company or AFIMS for the portion of the
year or period ending on, and the portion of the year or period beginning
after, the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Company or
AFIMS had a taxable year or period which ended at the close of the Closing
Date, except that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on
an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned
on a time basis. 

 

  (d) Seller hereby indemnifies Buyer for and agrees to hold it harmless
for any adverse tax consequence or any other loss or expense arising out of a
misrepresentation or breach of warranty made by Seller to Buyer in Section
3.18.

 

  (e) Seller hereby indemnifies Buyer and agrees to hold it harmless
from any adverse tax consequence to the Company or any other loss or
expense (including any adverse tax consequence arising out of the Company
being required to decrease its basis in any assets) to the extent that the
Internal Revenue Service recharacterizes or fails to respect the identified
mixed straddle elections set forth on Schedule 8.01(e) made by the Company
pursuant to Section 1092(b) of the Code and the regulations thereunder in July
of 2004.

 

  (f) Any payment by Buyer or Seller under this Section 8.01(e) will be
an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 

  (g) (i)  Seller shall file or cause to be filed when due all Federal
Tax Returns  and Combined Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or
with respect  to the Company or AFIMS for taxable years or periods ending on
or before  the Closing Date and, except to the extent treated as a liability
in the  calculation of Statutory Adjusted Capital, shall pay any Taxes due in
respect  of such Federal Tax Returns and Combined Tax Returns, and (ii)
Seller shall  file or cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns that are
required to  be filed on or before the Closing Date by or with respect to the
Company  and AFIMS for taxable years ending on or before the Closing Date and
shall  pay any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Buyer shall file or
cause  to be filed when due all Tax Returns (other than the Tax Returns
referred  to in clause (g)(i)) required to be filed by or with respect to the
Company  and AFIMS after the Closing Date with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period.  Any such Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice  and without a change of any election or any accounting method and
shall  be submitted by Buyer to Seller for Sellers approval (together with 
schedules, statements and, to the extent requested by Seller, supporting 
documentation) at least ten (10) business days prior to the due date
(including  extensions) of such Tax Return, provided that Buyer shall not be
required  to prepare such Returns in a manner consistent with past practice,
and it  may change any election or any accounting method, and it shall not be
required  to obtain Sellers approval, to the extent that Buyer waives its
right to  be indemnified by Seller from any liability arising by reason of
any item, election, or method that

 

84    
      

  differs from past practice. Buyer agrees to  make such changes in such Tax
Returns as Seller shall reasonably request,  provided that Buyer will not be
required to make any such reasonable changes  to the extent that it agrees to
release Seller from its obligation to indemnify  Buyer for any Taxes arising
by reason of Buyers failure to accept  such proposed change. To the extent
Seller is responsible for such Tax under  this Article 8, Seller shall pay
the amount due on the Tax Return to Buyer two (2) Business Days prior to the
date that the Tax becomes due.

 

  (h) Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon receipt by
Buyer, any of its affiliates or the Company and AFIMS of notice of
any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign income or
franchise tax audits or assessments which may affect the tax liabilities of
the Company and AFIMS for which Seller would be required to indemnify Buyer
pursuant to Section 8.01(a),  _provided_ that  failure to comply with this
provision shall not affect Buyers right to indemnification hereunder except
to the extent Sellers  ability to defend against any such tax claim is
materially prejudiced thereby.  Seller shall control the defense of any claim
for Taxes relating to income  Taxes of the Seller Group; _provided_ that
Buyer shall be entitled  to participate at its expense in the defense of any
such claim which may  be the subject of indemnification by Seller pursuant to
Section 8.01(a)  . Buyer shall control the defense of any claim for Taxes
other than income  Taxes of the Seller Group, provided that Seller shall be
entitled to participate  at its expense in the defense of any claim which may
be the subject of indemnification  by Seller pursuant to Section 8.01(a);
provided further that Buyer may not  settle or compromise any such claim
without Sellers consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld. Buyer may
settle or compromise any such claim without Sellers  consent if it agrees to
release Seller of its indemnification obligation  with respect to such claim.
For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions set forth in Section 10.03(i)
shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to the control of the defense of claims for
Taxes under this Article 8.

 

  Section 8.02 _. Information to be Provided by Buyer._ With  respect
to the taxable year of Seller ending December 31, 2004 and the period  in
2005 prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall promptly cause the Company  and
AFIMS to prepare and provide to Seller a package of tax information 
materials (the "Tax Package"), which shall be completed in accordance with
past practice including past practice as to providing  the information,
schedules and work papers and as to the method of computation  of separate
taxable income or other relevant measure of income of the Company  and AFIMS.
Buyer shall cause the Tax Package for the portion of the taxable  period
ending on the Closing Date to be delivered to Seller within one
hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date.

 

  Section 8.03 _. Assistance, Cooperation, and Retention of Documents._
After the Closing Date, each of Seller and Buyer shall:

 

85    
      

>  
>
> (a) assist (and cause their respective affiliates to assist) the other
> party in preparing any Tax Returns or reports which such other party is 
> responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with Section 8.01(g);

>  
>
> (b) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with
> taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Company and AFIMS;

>  
>
> (c) make available to the other and to any Taxing Authority as

>  
>
> (d) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or
> threatened tax audits or assessments of the Company and AFIMS for taxable 
> periods for which the other may have a liability under Section 8.01;

>  
>
> (e) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from
> any Taxing Authority in connection with any tax audit or information 
> request with respect to any such taxable period; and
>
>  
>
> (f) retain or cause to be retained all Books and Records relating to
> Taxes pertinent to the Seller, the Company, AFIMS, FAFLIC and the 
> Subsidiaries until the applicable period of assessment under Law (giving
> effect to any and all extensions or waivers) has expired, and to abide by or
> cause the abidance with all record retention agreements entered into with
> any Taxing Authority. 
>
>

parties set forth in this Article 8 shall be unconditional and absolute
and shall remain in effect without limitation as to time.

calendar year following the Closing Date; _provided_ that the representations
and warranties contained in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.05, 3.06, 3.07, 3.17, 3.18
and 3.19 (the "Specified Warranties") and Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.09 and 4.10
shall survive indefinitely or until expiration of the relevant statute of
limitation.

 

  (b) The covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in

or therewith, shall survive the Closing indefinitely or until expiration of

inaccuracy or breach of representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement shall survive
the

 

94    
      

  time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding
paragraphs, if notice of the inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise to such
right of indemnity, providing a reasonably detailed description (in light of
the information available at the time of the notice) as to the basis for such
claim of breach, shall have been given to the party against whom such
indemnity may be sought prior to such time.

 

  Section 10.02 _. Indemnification._ The parties shall indemnify each
other as follows:

 

  (a) Effective  at and after the Closing, and subject to the other
provisions of this Article  10, Seller hereby indemnifies Buyer and its
Affiliates (including, for the  avoidance of doubt, the Company from and
after the Closing) and their respective  successors and assigns (the "Buyer
Indemnified Persons")  against, and agrees to hold each of them harmless
from, and reimburse them  for, any and all Losses actually imposed on or
incurred or suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Person, arising out of or
resulting from:

>  

 

  _provided_ that, with respect to each of the foregoing clauses (i) through
(v), as applicable:

 

>  
>

>>  

>>

>> (I) any Shared Losses subject to indemnification by Seller pursuant to
Section 10.02(a)(iii) shall be paid by Seller as follows: (x) 100% of the
first $10,000,000 of the aggregate incurred Shared  Losses, (y) 66 2 / 3 % of
the aggregate incurred Shared Losses in excess of $10,000,000 and up to and
including an aggregate of $50,000,000 of Shared Losses, and (z)  100% of the
aggregate incurred Shared Losses in excess of $50,000,000 (it being
understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that the limitations with respect to
indemnification set forth in Section 10.02(a)(iii) apply to indemnification
for Shared  Losses);

>>

>>  

>>

>> (II) the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to
indemnification by Seller for Losses arising out of or resulting from (x) the
matters disclosed to Seller by Buyer in writing on or prior to the  date
hereof that the parties agree shall be subject to this proviso and (y) the
matters set forth on Schedule 3.21(b) only to the extent such Losses are
included within (1) clause (ii) of the definition of Losses or (2) clause
(iii) of the  definition of Losses and were incurred in connection with
Losses included within clause (ii) of the definition of Losses; and

>>

>>  

>
>  

 

97    
      

>  
>

>>  

>>

>> (III) Seller shall have no liability for the following out-of-pocket
expenses of any Buyer Indemnified Person in connection with the defense of a
Claim or a Third Party Representation Claim controlled  by Seller: (1) the
salaries and benefits of employees of any Buyer Indemnified Person or (2) the
fees and expenses of any independent counsel retained by any Buyer Indemnified
Person, unless there exists a reasonable likelihood of an actual conflict  of
interest between such Buyer Indemnified Person and Seller with respect to such
Third Party Representation Claim or Claim, in which case this clause (III)(2)
shall not apply and Seller shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and
expenses of  one independent counsel for all Buyer Indemnified Persons in
each applicable jurisdiction, _provided_ that  no actual conflict of interest
shall be deemed to exist as a result of  the Buyer Indemnified Persons, on
the one hand, and Seller, or one or more  of Sellers Affiliates, on the
other hand, being co-defendants if  Seller acknowledges in writing its
obligation under this Section 10.02  to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Persons for Losses arising out of or  resulting from such Claim or Third
Party Representation Claim.

>>

>>  

>
>  

 

  For the avoidance of doubt, if a claim for indemnification is made by
Buyer with respect to a Shared Loss, such claim shall be applied first to the
$5,000,000 deductible set forth in Section 10.02(a)(iii)(B) above, and after
such deductible is not available to Seller, shall be allocated as provided in
clause (I) above until no further obligations of Seller exist due to the
application of the caps set forth in Sections 10.02(a)(iii)(C) and
10.02(a)(iii)(D) above. As an illustration of the foregoing principle by way
of example only, assume that Buyer makes a claim for indemnification in the
amount of $1,000,000, and Seller does not reimburse Buyer for such Loss
because the amount claimed does not reach the $5,000,000 deductible specified
in Section 10.02(a)(iii)(B): in such case, the amount of $1,000,000 claimed by
Buyer will not be attributed to Seller for purposes of the calculation of the
staggered indemnification thresholds set forth in clause (I)(x), (y) and (z)
of the immediately preceding proviso.

 

  (b) Effective  at and after the Closing, Buyer hereby indemnifies
Seller and its Affiliates  and their respective successors and assigns (the
"Seller Indemnified Persons") against, and agrees to hold each of them
harmless from, and reimburse them for, any and all Losses actually imposed on
or incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnified Person arising out of or
resulting from (i) any Warranty Breach (disregarding for purposes of this
Section 10.02(b)(i) any qualifications relating to materiality, including the
term "Material Adverse Effect"), (ii) any Liability arising out of the
conduct of the Core Business following the Closing and the conduct of the
Funds Business following the AIT Merger Closing and (iii) any breach of
covenant or agreement made or to be

 

98    
      

  performed by Buyer or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_
that  with respect to indemnification by Buyer for Warranty Breaches
pursuant  to Section 10.02(b)(i) (other than Warranty Breaches pursuant to
Sections  4.01, 4.02, 4.09 and 4.10): (A) Buyer shall not be liable for any
individual  Warranty Breach (and such Warranty Breach shall be disregarded
for all purposes  hereunder) unless the Losses with respect to such Warranty
Breach exceeds  $5,000 (it being understood that all Warranty Breaches
arising from the  same nucleus of operative facts shall collectively be
deemed an individual  Warranty Breach for purposes of this clause (A)), (B)
Buyer shall not be  liable for Warranty Breaches unless the aggregate amount
of Losses with  respect to such Warranty Breaches exceeds $5,000,000 and then
only to the  extent of such excess and (C) Buyers maximum liability for all
such  Warranty Breaches shall not exceed an amount equal to 50% of the
Purchase Price.

 

  (c) If  Seller consolidates with or merges into another Person or
conveys, transfers  or leases all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person  and Seller determines that any such transaction
requires, as a matter of  applicable Law, the approval of Sellers
shareholders, Seller shall,  as a condition precedent to such transaction,
cause the Person formed by  such consolidation or into which Seller is merged
or the Person which acquires  by conveyance or transfer, or which leases, all
or substantially all of  the properties and assets of Seller to expressly
assume, by an instrument  executed and delivered to Buyer, all obligations
and liabilities of Seller pursuant to Section 8.01 and Article 10 hereof.

 

  (d) A Buyer Indemnified Person may elect, at its discretion, to pursue
a claim for indemnification covered by both Sections 10.02(a)(iii)
and 10.02(a)(iv) under either such Section, but in no such event shall any
Buyer Indemnified Party be entitled to duplicative recovery.

 

  Section 10.03 _. Procedure for Third Party Claims._ (a)  The party
seeking indemnification under Section 10.02 (the "Indemnified Party")  agrees
to give prompt written notice to the party from whom indemnity is  sought
(the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any Action in respect of which
indemnity may be sought under  such Section and will provide the Indemnifying
Party such information with  respect thereto that the Indemnifying Party may
request. The failure to  so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party  of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent,
and only to the extent,  that such failure shall have actually prejudiced the
Indemnifying Party in the defenses or other rights available to the
Indemnifying Party.

 

  (b) Seller shall be responsible for assuming control and diligently
defending each Claim and each Third Party Representation Claim (in each case
with counsel reasonably acceptable to Buyer; it being agreed, however, that
all current counsel with respect to the Existing Claims is acceptable to
Buyer), unless

 

99    
      

  Buyer elects under Sections 10.03(c), 10.03(d), 10.03(f) or 10.03(g) to
assume control of the defense of the Claim or a Third Party Representation
Claim.

 

  (c) With  respect to each New Claim and Third Party Representation
Claim, Seller shall  notify Buyer, not later than the earlier of (i) the time
Seller makes a  determination that it is not liable under Section 10.02(a)
with respect  to such New Claim or Third Party Representation Claim, which
determination  Seller shall make as promptly as reasonably practicable, and
(ii) 180 days  after assuming control of the defense thereof, whether or not
Seller acknowledges  that such New Claim or Third Party Representation Claim
is covered by Sellers indemnification obligations under Section 10.02(a) . If
Seller notifies Buyer in writing on or prior to the earlier of the dates
described in clauses (i) and (ii) above that Seller has determined that it has
no indemnification obligation under Section 10.02(a) with respect to such New
Claim or Third Party Representation Claim or fails to provide such
notification, then Buyer (or another Buyer Indemnified Party) shall at such
time be entitled to assume control of the defense of such New Claim or Third
Party Representation Claim without agreeing to the ultimate liability as
between Buyer and Seller with respect to such New Claim or Third Party
Representation Claim, subject to Seller having the right to re-assume control
upon acknowledging in writing that such New Claim or Third Party
Representation Claim is covered by Sellers indemnification obligations under
Section 10.02(a) .

 

  (d) Regardless  of who controls the defense of a Claim or a Third
Party Representation Claim,  no party shall enter into a settlement of a
Claim or a Third Party Representation  Claim without the other partys prior
written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), it being
understood that if a party is solely responsible for all financial costs of
such settlement and such settlement (A) provides solely for monetary
payments, (B) does not contain an admission of guilt or liability by any other
party or any of such other partys Affiliates and (C) includes a full and
unconditional release of each other party and of all of such other partys
Affiliates from all liabilities in respect of such Claim or Third Party
Representation Claim, then any refusal of the other party to consent to such
settlement shall be deemed to have been unreasonably withheld.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Buyer may, in its sole
discretion, for any reason withhold its consent to any settlement of a Claim
or Third Party Representation Claim proposed by Seller, _provided_ that Buyer
(i) assumes control of the defense of such Claim or Third Party
Representation Claim, (ii) pays 100% of (x) all reasonable legal costs
(including all attorneys fees and expenses and other out-of-pocket
expenses) incurred thereafter by any party in connection with such Claim or
Third Party Representation Claim and (y) all costs of any settlement, judicial
award or judgment, or regulatory fine or penalty with respect to such Claim or
Third Party Representation Claim to the extent exceeding Sellers proposed
settlement amount, and (iii) indemnifies each Seller Indemnified Person
against any incremental adverse consequences of such settlement, judicial
award or judgment,

 

100    
      

  or regulatory fine or penalty relative to the consequences that the
settlement proposed by Seller would have had if such settlement had been
effected (including any incremental adverse precedent for Seller or its
Affiliates or their respective businesses or for the Core Business, the Funds
Business, the Non-Core Business, the Company or AFIMS) resulting from such
settlement, judicial award or judgment, or regulatory fine or penalty relative
to the adverse precedent for such entities and businesses that would have
resulted from the settlement proposed by Seller if such settlement had been
effected; _provided_ that, except with respect to the Core Business, the
Funds Business, the Non-Core Business, the Company and AFIMS, to none of which
this proviso applies, the incremental adverse precedent described above shall
include only such precedent that does, or would be reasonably expected to,
adversely affect Seller, any of its Affiliates or their respective businesses
in a manner disproportionate to the manner in which it adversely affects, or
would be reasonably expected to adversely affect, (A) the property and
casualty, (B) the life and annuity or (C) health insurance industries, as
applicable, in the United States generally), except to the extent such
disproportionate effect results from the policyholder demographics, the
product mix or the design or product features of Seller, any of its
Affiliates or their respective businesses.

 

  (e) With respect to (i) all Existing Claims and (ii) following the
Closing Date, after any Buyer Indemnified Party acquires knowledge of
any fact or circumstance (whether discovered by such Buyer Indemnified Party
or brought to its attention by Seller or a third party, including through a
Claim) that results in or reasonably would be expected to result in a New
Claim, a Warranty Breach or a Third Party Representation Claim, Buyer will
notify Seller promptly thereof ( _provided_ that Buyers failure to so notify
Seller shall not relieve Seller of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent, and only to the extent, that such failure shall have actually
prejudiced Seller in the defenses or other rights available to Seller) and
Buyer shall implement, and cause each other Buyer Indemnified Party to
implement, such reasonable actions as Seller shall request in writing for the
purposes of mitigating the possible Losses arising therefrom (such actions,
"Mitigation Actions"). In determining whether a proposed Mitigation Action is
reasonable, the parties will take into account, among other relevant factors,
(A) the requirements of Law and any applicable life insurance policy or
annuity contract, (B) what is reasonably advisable in order to avoid a
material potential Liability to the relevant policyholder or contract holder
or an action by a Governmental Entity and any additional Losses that are
reasonably likely to arise from taking such Mitigation Action, (C) the
industry standards and practices in respect of similar facts and
circumstances, (D) the monetary costs and benefits of such action (as opposed
to no action or alternative possible actions) to Buyer (without regard to the
existence of any indemnification obligation of Seller under this Article 10)
and (E) the effects of such action on the reputation of the Core Business and
the ongoing conduct of the Core Business. Notwithstanding the

 

101    
      

  foregoing, Buyer shall not be required to implement  a Mitigation Action
if (x) Buyer reasonably believes that such Mitigation  Action is inconsistent
with material legal positions or theories actually  advanced or intended to
be advanced by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in  a legal or regulatory
proceeding in connection with its business operations  (including the
business operations acquired hereunder) and (y) Buyer agrees  to pay 100% of
all Losses (including legal costs (including all attorneys  fees and
expenses and other out-of-pocket expenses) and the costs of any  settlement,
judicial award or judgment, regulatory fine or penalty or corrective  or
remedial action) in excess of the reasonably proposed and documented  costs
of the remedial action proposed by Seller under this Section 10.03(e) .

 

  (f) With  respect to any Claim or Third Party Representation Claim,
in the event such  Claim or Third Party Representation Claim (i) involves a
claim for and is  reasonably likely to result in Losses in excess of $75
million and it is  reasonably likely that Seller will be unable to pay such
Losses, (ii) seeks  injunctive or equitable relief affecting a general
practice of the Core  Business or (iii) is unresolved at a time when the
Standard and Poors rating of Sellers senior debt is "B-" or lower (or Sellers
senior debt is unrated by Standard and Poors), and, as to (iii), either (x) it
is reasonably likely that the Losses resulting from all Claims and Third-
Party Representation Claims then unresolved or unpaid will equal or exceed $15
million or (y) it is reasonably likely that such Losses resulting from all
Claims and Third Party Representation Claims then unresolved or unpaid will
be less than $15 million but it is reasonably likely that Seller will be
unable to pay all such Losses, Buyer may elect, following discussion with
Seller, either (1) with respect to a Claim or Third Party Representation
Claim for which Seller has not retained outside counsel, to require Seller to
engage an outside counsel (reasonably acceptable to Buyer) to substantively
handle the defense at Sellers expense or (2) to assume control of the
defense with counsel selected by Buyer (reasonably acceptable to Seller) with
the expense of such counsel borne 50% by Buyer and 50 percent by Seller.

 

  (g) With respect to any investigation or Action by the SEC or NASD,
the parties agree to follow the procedures and observe the terms
and conditions set forth in Schedule 10.03(g).

 

  (h) Regardless  of which party controls the defense of a Claim or a
Third Party Representation  Claim, the parties shall share all information
regarding such Claim or Third  Party Representation Claim. The controlling
party with respect to each Claim  or Third Party Representation Claim (i)
shall allow the other party adequate  opportunity to monitor and consult with
it and its outside counsel with  respect to such defense, including any
settlement discussions, (ii) shall  give the other partys views good faith
consideration in connection  with all significant decisions, including
decisions with respect to settlement (it being understood that

 

102    
      

  the controlling party has no obligation to follow  or implement the other
partys views or recommendations) and (iii)  if Buyer is the controlling
party pursuant to Sections 10.03(c), 10.03(d),  10.03(e), 10.03(f) and
10.03(g), shall allow Seller to attend for monitoring  purposes all
settlement discussions. Such monitoring and consultation by  the other party
shall be at its own expense, except as provided in clause (III) of the
proviso at the end of Section 10.02(a) .

 

  (i) In  furtherance of the foregoing, the parties recognize that they
have common  interests in the defense of certain litigation which may result
in the exchange  between the parties or their counsel of documents or other
information that  is subject to the attorney-client privilege, the work
product doctrine or  common interest privilege (collectively, "Privileges";
and such exchanged  documents and other information collectively, the
"Privileged Information") and agree to take reasonable best efforts to
protect and maintain, and to cause their Affiliates to protect and maintain,
any applicable claim to Privilege in order to protect such Privileged
Information from disclosure or use. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Seller, Buyer and their Affiliates shall not (i) waive any
Privilege with respect to any such Privileged Information, (ii) fail to defend
in a commercially reasonable manner any Privilege with respect to any such
Privileged Information, or (iii) fail to take any other commercially
reasonable action necessary to preserve any Privilege with respect to any such
Privileged Information (each of the actions in clauses (i) through (iii), a
"Waiver"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller or Buyer or any of their
Affiliates may effect a Waiver (1) of factual information, _i.e._ ,
information not including the mental impressions or analysis of attorneys or
consultants, which factual information is Privileged solely as a result of the
work product doctrine; _provided_ that such party states in writing in
connection with any such production that such production does not constitute
a Waiver as to any other Privileged Information or obtains adequate
assurances that such production will not constitute a Waiver as to any other
Privileged Information, (2) with the prior written consent of the other party
hereto (including on behalf of any affected Affiliate), (3) if in the written
opinion of the Waiving partys counsel addressed to the non-Waiving party
(such counsel to be reasonably acceptable to the non-Waiving party) such
Waiver is required by Law or Order, (4) if such Waiver has or
would reasonably be expected to have an immaterial adverse effect on the
Losses directly or indirectly incurred or suffered by the non-Waiving party
or for which the non-Waiving party is otherwise responsible (including
through indemnification under Section 10.02(a) or 10.02(b), as applicable)
arising out of or resulting from any pending third-party Action or any future
third-party Action, (5) if such Waiver has or would reasonably be expected to
have a non-immaterial adverse effect on the Losses directly or indirectly
incurred or suffered by the non-Waiving party or for which the non-Waiving
party is otherwise responsible (including through indemnification under
Section 10.02(a) or 10.02(b), as applicable) arising out of or resulting from
any pending third-party Action or any

 

103    
      

  future third-party Action and the Waiving party (or whose Affiliate shall
be effecting such Waiver) pays the non-Waiving party 50 percent of all Losses
incurred or suffered after such Waiver by the non-Waiving party or any of
its Affiliates arising out of or resulting from such pending third-party
Action or such future third-party Action, or (6) if, in the case of a Waiver
effected by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, Buyer or its Affiliates have
effected any such Waiver in connection with any third-party Action the
defense of which Buyer has assumed, pursuant to Section 10.03(c) or otherwise,
and with respect to which third-party Action Seller has no obligation to
indemnify Buyer hereunder; _provided_ that, in the case of clause (6), if
such Waiver has or would reasonably be expected to have a non-
immaterial adverse effect on the Losses directly or indirectly incurred or
suffered by Seller or for which Seller is otherwise responsible (including
through indemnification under Section 10.02(a)), arising out of or resulting
from a third-party Action, Buyer (or Buyers Affiliate effecting such Waiver)
shall pay Seller 50 percent of all Losses (x) for which Seller is responsible
to Buyer or its Affiliates under this Agreement (including through
indemnification under Section 10.02(a)), (y) incurred or suffered after such
Waiver by Seller or any of its Affiliates and (z) to the extent arising out
of or resulting from such third-party Action; and _provided further_ that, in
the case of clauses (1) through (6) above, the party affecting any Waiver
shall have given prior notice to the non-Waiving party and consulted in good
faith regarding such Waiver. For the avoidance of doubt, obligations of Buyer
set forth in clauses (5) and (6) above shall apply with respect to any Waiver
(to the extent such clauses are otherwise applicable under the terms thereof)
if the Waiver permitted by clause (1) above results in, or is accompanied by,
a Waiver of any other Privileged Information. The obligation to reimburse
Losses under the foregoing clauses (5) and (6) shall not in itself result in
any right to control or participate in the defense of any third-party Action.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, no party or
its representatives shall be obliged to share or provide access to any
Privileged Information prior to or at the Closing.

 

  (j) Each party shall reasonably cooperate, and cause its respective
Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of each Claim
and Third Party Representation Claim and shall furnish or cause to be
furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the parties and their Affiliates shall cooperate reasonably
with each other and their counsel in the investigation, trial and defense of
any Claim or Third Party Representation Claim (including the filing of any
cross-claim, counterclaim or other proceeding deemed reasonably appropriate by
Seller) and any appeal arising therefrom. Such cooperation shall include the
parties and their Affiliates giving prompt written notice to each other of
any notice, request, pleading or similar matter they shall

 

104    
      

  receive relating to any Claim and Third Party  Representation Claim, and
making available, without charge upon reasonable  advance notice and during
normal business hours, to each other and their  counsel such of their and
their Affiliates books, records, documents and other data, and such of their
and their Affiliates Representatives  as shall be reasonably necessary. The
parties and their Affiliates hereby  agree to retain all such books, records,
documents and other data in accordance with their document retention policies
as in effect from time to time.

 

  (k) Buyer  shall use reasonable efforts to collect any amounts
available under those  insurance policies set forth on Schedule 3.30(a)
hereto (to the extent of  Buyers rights to make claims and receive proceeds
directly under such policies) and, upon Sellers written request, from any
other Person alleged to be responsible, in each case for any Losses
indemnified by Seller under Section 10.02. Buyers obligations under this
Section 10.03(k) shall not alter, reduce or obviate in any manner
Sellers indemnification obligations under this Article 10 except as
contemplated by Section 10.04(a) .

 

  (l) Any dispute between the parties with regard to whether a party has
an indemnification obligation under Article 10 shall be exclusively resolved
through an expedited arbitration proceeding under the rules of JAMS/Endispute
by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with this paragraph, each of whom
shall be persons with experience in the life insurance and annuity industries,
with the non-prevailing party reimbursing the prevailing party for its
reasonable legal costs, unless the arbitrators determine that the non-
prevailing party had reasonable good-faith grounds for asserting its position
in such arbitration proceeding. The party initiating the arbitration shall
appoint one arbitrator within 30 days of such initiation, and the respondent
in such arbitration shall appoint a second arbitrator no later than 30 days
thereafter. The third arbitrator shall be jointly appointed by the first and
second arbitrators within 30 days of the nomination of the second arbitrator.
The arbitration decision shall be final, binding and enforceable upon the
parties.

 

  Section 10.04 _. Calculation of Losses._ (a) The amount of any Losses
payable under Article 10 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any
(i) amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable
insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible
therefor, (ii) any Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party, and
(iii) amounts received by an Indemnified Party with respect to the same
Losses pursuant to the Non-Core Coinsurance Agreement. If the Indemnified
Party actually recovers any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or
from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses, subsequent to
an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified
Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or
expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such
indemnification payment

 

105    
      

  up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses
incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.

 

  (b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 10.02 for
any (i) Losses relating to any matter to the extent that reserves for such
Losses were expressly set forth on the Pro Forma Closing Balance Sheet and
such reserves reduced the amount of the Final Adjustment or (ii) consequential
or punitive Losses (unless such Losses were obtained by a third party in
connection with a Claim or a Third Party Representation Claim).

 

  Section 10.05 _. Assignment of Claims._ If  the Indemnified Party
receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in  respect of any Losses
pursuant to Section 10.02 and the Indemnified Party  could have recovered all
or a part of such Losses from a third party (a "Potential Contributor") 
based on the underlying Claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the 
Indemnified Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the 
Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party  to
recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment; _provided_
that  a Buyer Indemnified Person is not required to assign such rights under
insurance  policies except with respect to those insurance policies set forth
on Schedule  3.30(a) hereto (to the extent of Buyers rights to make claims
and receive proceeds directly under such policies).

 

  Section 10.06 _. Exclusivity._ Effective as of the Closing, Buyer
waives any rights and claims Buyer may have against Seller, whether in law
or in equity, relating to the Company or the Shares or the Transactions,
except for rights and claims expressly contemplated by this Agreement
(including Articles 2, 8 and 10 hereof) or specifically in any Ancillary
Agreement and except for any claims of fraud. The rights and claims waived by
Buyer include claims for contribution or other rights of recovery arising out
of or relating to any Environmental Law (whether now or hereinafter in
effect), claims for breach of contract, breach of representation or warranty,
negligent misrepresentation and all other claims for breach of duty. Effective
as of the Closing, the rights and claims expressly contemplated by Articles 2,
8 and 10 hereof or specifically in any Ancillary Agreement, except for any
claims of fraud, shall provide the exclusive remedy and only source of
procedures with respect to any claim relating to the Company or the Shares or
the Transactions. Article 8 shall provide the exclusive remedy and only source
of procedures with respect to any claim that is made under or subject to
Article 8.

 

  Section 10.07 _. Purchase Price Adjustment and Interest._ Any amount
paid by Seller or Buyer under Section 2.11, Section 6.03, 7.07 and 7.08
and Articles 8 and 10 will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 

106

and 11.04, such termination shall be without liability of either party (or
any Representative of such party) to the other party to this Agreement;

specify for the purpose by advance notice to the other parties hereto. All
such notices, requests and other communications shall be effective only upon
(i) mailing of such notice, request or other communication and the actual
receipt thereof by the

 

110    
      

  relevant party, or (ii) a facsimile transmission of such notice, request or
other communication and the acknowledgment by the relevant party of receipt
thereof.

 

  Section 12.02 _. Amendments and Waivers; Remedies Cumulative._ (a) Any
provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party to this Agreement, or in the case of a waiver, by the party
against whom the waiver is to be effective.

 

  (b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

 

  Section 12.03 _. Expenses._ (a) Except for Transaction Expenses or as
otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

 

  (b) All Transaction Expenses shall be borne equally by Buyer and
Seller; _provided_ that  (x) Buyer shall bear 100% of the New Vendor Payments
and (y) the GSVIT Transaction  Payments shall be allocated and borne by Buyer
and Seller pursuant to Schedule  12.03. "Transaction Expenses" means any and
all costs and  expenses incurred in connection with (i) obtaining the
consents of third  parties in connection with the Transactions or approval of
Governmental  Authorities (including under Section 7.01); (ii) the making of
any filings  with, furnishing of information to or seeking to obtain any
actions or waivers  from any Governmental Entity (including under Section
7.02); and (iii) (A)  itemized conversion costs actually incurred, and
reasonably documented to  Buyer, by Seller and its Affiliates of up to $7.0
million in the aggregate  (other than the New Vendor Payments), and (B)
itemized retention costs actually  incurred, and reasonably documented to
Buyer, by Seller and its Affiliates  of up to $3.6 million in the aggregate,
_provided_ that Buyer shall  only be required to pay such itemized,
documented retention costs with respect  to employees of Seller or its
Affiliates actually engaged in providing such  transition services. "GSVIT
Transaction Payments" means the costs and expenses incurred in connection with
the AIT Merger Closing set forth on Schedule 12.03. Buyer shall as promptly
as practicable upon receipt from Seller of any demand for reimbursement of any
such conversion or retention costs, review such itemized costs and the
supporting materials therefor, which Seller shall provide to Buyer
together with any demand for reimbursement. If Buyer disagrees in any respect
with such conversion or retention costs submitted, the parties shall discuss
in good faith for a period of 15 days, with the participation of appropriate
personnel, any such disagreement and review Sellers cost itemization and the
supporting materials, with a view to promptly resolving any such disagreement
and promptly reaching a mutually

 

111    
      

  acceptable calculation. If, following such 15-day period, the parties
cannot reach such a mutually acceptable calculation, then Buyer shall
reimburse Seller for the conversion or retention costs, as applicable, based
on the itemization that Seller submitted to Buyer (as adjusted to reflect any
disagreements of Buyer that Seller has agreed to accept). All conversion costs
in excess of $7.0 million in the aggregate (other than the New Vendor
Payments) shall be borne by Seller. All retention costs in excess of $3.6
million in the aggregate shall be borne by Seller. Transaction Expenses shall
in no event include any compensation to be paid by Buyer to a Solicited
Employee.

 

  (c) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest,
but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any income or franchise Taxes)
incurred in connection with transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including any real property transfer Tax and any similar Tax) shall be borne
equally by Buyer and Seller. Buyer will file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all such Taxes and fees, and, if required
by applicable Law or Order, Seller will, and will cause its Affiliates to,
join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

 

  Section 12.04 _. No Rights of Setoff._ Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, any payment to be made
by Buyer to Seller (including by Buyer to FAFLIC under Section 2.07 hereof) or
Seller to Buyer, as applicable, hereunder shall not be subject to any setoff,
counterclaim, deduction, withholding or recoupment for claims made pursuant to
or amounts due or owing under this Agreement (including Article 10), any
Ancillary Agreement or otherwise (except as otherwise permitted in any such
agreement).

 

  Section 12.05 _. Successors and Assigns._ The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Neither Seller nor Buyer
may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other and any
attempted assignment without the required consent shall be void; provided
that no such consent from Seller shall be required for Buyer to assign part or
all of its rights under this Agreement to one or more of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, but no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of any of its
obligations hereunder.

 

  Section 12.06 _. Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware,
without regard to the conflicts of law rules thereof.

 

112    
      

  Section 12.07 _. Jurisdiction._ The parties hereto agree that any
suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based
on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought exclusively in the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware or any Delaware state
court, so long as one of such courts shall have subject matter jurisdiction
over such suit, action or proceeding, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that
service of process on such party as provided in Section 12.01 shall be deemed
effective service of process on such party.

 

  Section 12.08 _. Waiver of Jury Trial._ EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

  Section 12.09 _. Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third-Party
Beneficiaries._ This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the
signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement
shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto. Until and unless
each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party
hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right
or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication). No provision of this Agreement is intended
to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations, or liabilities
hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 

  Section 12.10 _. Entire Agreement._ This Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements constitute the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

 

  Section 12.11 _. Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions,

 

113    
      

  covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
