right to receive upon such surrender the consideration provided herein.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if any holder of
shares of Seller Stock should be unable to surrender the Certificates for such
shares, because they have been lost or destroyed, such holder may deliver in
lieu thereof, in the discretion of Company, such bond in form and substance

entitled to receive the consideration provided herein. No interest shall be
paid on the Per Share Cash Consideration.

Time with respect to Company Stock with a record date after the Effective

effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate by a
holder receiving Company Stock pursuant to the provisions hereof, there shall
be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
Company Stock issued in exchange therefore, without interest, (i) at the time
of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional
share of Company Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.4 and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date

Company Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable

transfers on the stock transfer books of Seller or Company of the shares
of Seller Stock, which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

stockholders of Seller following the passage of six months after the Effective

consideration provided herein.

Seller Stock for such shares (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

(g) The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of
ownership with respect to the shares of Company Stock held by it from time to

only upon delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent) in such form as
Company and Seller shall mutually agree ("Election Form") shall be mailed no
less than 35 days prior to the anticipated Effective Time or on such other
date as Seller and Company shall mutually agree ("Mailing Date") to each
holder of record of Seller Stock as of five (5) Business Days prior to the
Mailing Date ("Election Form Record Date"). Company shall make available one
or more Election Forms as may be reasonably requested by all persons who
become holders (or beneficial owners) of Seller Stock after the Election Form
Record Date and prior to the Election Deadline (as defined below), and Seller
shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for
it to perform its obligations as specified herein. Each Election Form shall
permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary
documentation and instructions) to elect (an "Election") to receive either
(i) Company Stock (a "Stock Election") with respect to all of such holders
Seller Stock, (ii) cash (a "Cash Election") with respect to all of
such holders Seller Stock, or (iii) a specified number of shares of Seller
Stock to receive Company Stock (a "Combination Stock Election") and a
specified number of shares of Seller Stock to receive cash (a "Combination
Cash Election"), subject to the provisions contained in this Agreement. Any
Seller Stock with respect to which the holder (or the beneficial owner, as the
case may be) shall not have submitted to the Exchange Agent, an effective,
properly completed Election Form received prior to the Election Deadline
shall be deemed to be "Undesignated Shares" hereunder.

(b) Any Election shall have been properly made and effective only if the
Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form
by 5:00 P.M. Nevada time on or before the 30th day following the Mailing Date,
or such later time and date as Company and Seller may mutually agree prior to
the Effective Time (the "Election Deadline"). An Election Form shall be deemed
properly completed only if an Election is indicated for each share of Seller
Stock covered by such Election Form and if accompanied by one or more
certificates (or customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss
or destruction of such certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such
certificates) representing all shares of Seller Stock covered by such
Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included in
or required by the  



 

15  Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person
submitting such Election Form at or prior to the Election Deadline. In the
event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares
of Seller Stock represented by such Election Form shall automatically become
Undesignated Shares unless and until a new Election is properly completed and
made with respect to such shares on or before the Election Deadline, and
Company shall cause the certificates representing such shares of Seller Stock
to be promptly returned without charge to the person submitting the revoked
Election Form upon written request to that effect from the holder who
submitted such Election Form. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of
the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any
decisions of Company required by the Exchange Agent and made in good faith in
determining such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither Company nor
the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any
defect in an Election Form.

(c) For purposes of this Section 2.7, the following definitions shall apply:

(i) "Total Consideration" shall mean the _sum_ of (A) the product of (1) the
Average Closing Price and (2) the number of shares of Company Stock actually
issued to holders of Seller Stock in the Merger pursuant to Stock Elections,
Combination Stock Elections or as a Stock Proration Factor (as hereinafter
defined), and (B) the amount of cash actually issued to holders of Seller
Stock in the Merger pursuant to Cash Elections, Combination Cash Elections or
as the Cash Proration Factor (as hereinafter defined).

(ii) "Required Stock Amount" shall mean, if Average Closing Price is between
$28.26 and $34.54, the lowest whole number of shares of Company Stock, which,
if multiplied by the Average Closing Price, results in a dollar amount equal
to seventy-five percent (75%) of the Total Consideration. If the Average
Closing Price is less than $28.26 or greater than $34.54, the Required
Stock Amount will be the lowest whole number of shares of Company Stock
determined by subtracting $32,520,632 from the Total Consideration and
dividing the result by the Average Closing Price.

(d) Company shall use its best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to effect
the allocation among the holders of Seller Stock of rights to receive Company
Stock or cash in the Merger as follows:

(i) If the conversion of shares of Seller Stock for which Cash Elections and
Combination Cash Elections shall have effectively been made would result in a
number of shares of Company Stock being issued that is greater than the
Required Stock Amount (which shall be determined for this purpose on the
assumption that all shares of Seller Stock [other than those for which Cash
Elections or Combination Cash Elections have been made] would be entitled to
receive Company Stock,) then, to the extent necessary so that the number of
shares of Company Stock to be issued  



 

16  in the Merger shall be equal to the Required Stock Amount, the Exchange
Agent shall make the following allocations and adjustments in the following
order: 

(1) shares of Seller Stock for which effective Cash Elections or Combination
Cash Elections have been made shall be converted into the right to receive
cash in an amount equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration;

(2) the Exchange Agent shall allocate on a pro rata basis to holders of
Undesignated Shares so much of the Per Share Cash Consideration as shall be
necessary so that the shares of Company Stock to be received by other holders
of Undesignated Shares, when combined with the number of shares of Company
Stock for which Stock Elections or Combination Stock Elections have been made
shall be equal to the Required Stock Amount. If all Undesignated Shares are
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration and the
shares for which Stock Election and Combination Stock Elections are still
greater than the Required Stock Amount, then;

(3) a stock proration factor (the "Stock Proration Factor") shall be
determined by dividing (x) the Required Stock Amount by (y) the product of the
total number of shares of Seller Stock with respect to which effective Stock
Elections and Combination Stock Elections were made multiplied by (z) the
Exchange Ratio. Each holder of Seller Stock who made an effective Stock
Election or Combination Stock Election shall be entitled to:

(a) the number of shares of Company Stock equal to the product of (x) the
Exchange Ratio, multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Seller Stock
covered by such Stock Election or Combination Stock Election, multiplied by
(z) the Stock Proration Factor; and

(b) cash in an amount equal to the product of (x) the Per Share Cash
Consideration, multiplied by (y) the number of shares Seller Stock covered by
such Stock Election or Combination Stock Election, multiplied by (z) one
minus the Stock Proration Factor.

(ii) If the conversion of the shares of Seller Stock for which Stock Elections
and Combination Stock Elections shall have effectively been made (based upon
the Exchange Ratio) would result in a number of shares of Company Stock being
issued that is less than the Required Stock Amount (which shall be determined
for this purpose on the assumption that all shares of Seller Stock [other
than those for which Stock Elections or Combination Stock Elections have been
made] would be entitled to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration), then, to
the extent necessary so that the number of shares of Company Stock to be
issued in the Merger shall be equal to the Required Stock Amount, the Exchange
Agent shall make the following allocations and adjustments in the following
order:

(1) each holder of Seller Stock who made an effective Stock Election or
Combination Stock Election shall receive the number of shares of Company
Stock equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of
shares of Seller Stock covered by such Stock Election or Combination Stock
Election;



 

17 (2) the Exchange Agent shall allocate on a pro rata basis to holders of
Undesignated Shares so much of the Company Stock as shall be necessary so
that the shares of Company Stock to be received by those holders, when
combined with the number of shares of Company Stock for which a Stock Election
or Combination Stock Election has been made shall be equal to at least the
Required Stock Amount. If all Undesignated Shares plus all shares as to which
Stock Elections and Combination Stock Elections have been made together are
still less than the Required Stock Amount, then;

(3) a cash proration factor (the "Cash Proration Factor") shall be determined
by dividing (x) the Required Stock Amount (less the shares for which an
effective Stock Election and Combination Stock Election has been made, plus
all the Undesignated Shares) by (y) the product of (i) the sum of the total
number of shares of Seller Stock with respect to which effective
Cash Elections and Combination Cash Elections were made multiplied by (ii)
the Exchange Ratio. Each holder of Seller Stock who made an effective Cash
Election or Combination Cash Election shall be entitled to:



     | (a) | cash equal to the product of (x) the Per Share Cash
Consideration, multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Seller Stock covered
by such Cash Election or Combination Cash Election, multiplied by (z) one
minus the Cash Proration Factor; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the number of shares of Company Stock equal to the product
of (x) the Exchange Ratio, multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Seller
Stock covered by such Cash Election or Combination Cash Election, multiplied
by (z) the Cash Proration Factor. 
---|---|--- 

(iii) If the aggregate number of shares of Seller Stock for which Stock
Elections and Combination Stock Elections shall have effectively been made
would result in a number of shares of Company Stock being issued that is equal
to the Required Stock Amount,

(1) the shares of Seller Stock for which effective Stock Elections and
Combination Stock Elections have been made shall be converted into the right
to receive Company Stock equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio
multiplied by the number of shares of Seller Stock covered by such Stock
Elections and Combination of Stock Elections;



 

18 (2) the shares of Seller Stock for which effective Cash Elections and
Combination Cash Elections have been made shall be converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration; and

(3) the Undesignated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration.

(iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if, after
applying the allocation rules set forth in the preceding subsections of this
Section 2.7(d), the aggregate value of the shares of Company Stock that would
be issued pursuant to the Merger (valued at the Average Closing Price) is less
than the Required Stock Amount or more than the Required Stock Amount,
Company shall be authorized to reallocate shares of Company Stock and cash
among the holders of the Seller Stock in good faith and in such a manner as
Company reasonably determines to be fair and equitable, or to vary the number
of shares of Company Stock to be issued in the Merger, in a manner such that
the number of shares of Company Stock to be issued in the Merger shall be
equal to the Required Stock Amount.

(e) The calculations required by Section 2.7(d) shall be prepared by Company
prior to the Effective Time and shall be set forth in a certificate executed
by the Chief Financial Officer of Company and furnished to Seller at least two
(2) Business Days prior to the Effective Time showing the manner of
calculation in reasonable detail. Any calculation of a portion of a share of
Company Stock shall be rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share, and
any cash payment shall be rounded to the nearest cent.

2.8 _Stock Options_.

(a) Subject to the terms of the Seller Stock Option Plan, each person who
holds one or more options to purchase Seller Stock shall be permitted to
exercise any options granted under the Seller Stock Option Plan, prior to the
Effective Time, in accordance with the terms of the Seller Stock Option Plan.
Seller will facilitate the exercise of those options by allowing
those options to be exercised and taxes paid by Seller or holder as permitted
by applicable law.

(b) For any options not exercised prior to the Effective Time of the Merger,
each optionee shall receive cash, shares of Company Stock, or a combination of
both, at their election, in consideration of the termination of such option.
For options paid in cash, the cash received for cancellation of options shall
be equal to the difference between the Per Share Cash Consideration and the
exercise price of the Seller Stock Option. For options paid in shares of
Company Stock, the number of such shares received in exchange for cancellation
of options shall be determined by dividing the aggregate difference between
the Per Share Cash Consideration and the exercise price for all of an
optionees options by the Average Closing Price and rounding up any fraction
to the next full share. 



 

19 (c) Pursuant to Section 9.2, continuing employees of Seller may elect to
receive, in lieu of the consideration provided in Section 2.8(b), substitute
options from Company.

execution and delivery by Company of this Agreement, the consummation of the
Merger or the transactions contemplated herein, nor compliance by Company with
any of the provisions hereof, will: (a) violate any provision of its Charter
Documents; (b) constitute a breach of or result in a default (or give rise to
any rights of termination, cancellation or acceleration, or any right to
acquire any securities or assets) under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, franchise, license, permit,
agreement, Encumbrances or other instrument or obligation to which Company is
a party, or by which Company or any of its respective properties or assets is

their duties in such capacities or against or affecting any properties of
Company or its Subsidiaries. There are no judgments, decrees, stipulations or
orders against Company or its Subsidiaries enjoining them or any of their
directors, officers or employees in respect of, or the effect of which is to
prohibit, any business practice or the acquisition of any property or the
conduct of business in any area of Company or its Subsidiaries. To the
knowledge of Company and its Subsidiaries, neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries are a party to any pending or, to the knowledge of any of their
officers, threatened legal, administrative or other claim, action, suit,
investigation, arbitration or proceeding challenging the validity
or propriety of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

3.7 _Compliance with Laws and Regulations_. Except as set forth in Companys
Disclosure Letter, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default
under or in breach of any provision of their Charter Documents or any Rule

respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and

Company and its Subsidiaries have been conducted only in the ordinary course,

Company has filed all SEC Reports required to be filed by it and none of
Companys SEC Reports contained at the time of filing any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstance under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the Companys
SEC Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished complied, or if not

applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and
any Rules promulgated thereunder applicable to the Companys SEC Reports.

3.11 _Regulatory Approvals_. To the knowledge of Company and its Subsidiaries,
Company and its Subsidiaries have no reason to believe that they would not

approval of any such application.



 

22 3.12 _Performance of Obligations_. Company and its Subsidiaries have each
performed all of the obligations required to be performed by them to date and
are not in material default under or in breach of any term or provision of any
material contract, and no event has occurred that, with the giving of notice
or the passage of time or both, would constitute such default or breach. To
Companys and its Subsidiaries knowledge, no party with whom any of them have
an agreement that is material to their business is in default thereunder.

3.13 _Licenses and Permits_. Each of Company and its Subsidiaries has all
licenses and permits that are necessary for the conduct of their
business, and such licenses are in full force and effect, except for any
failure to be in full force and effect that would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. The properties and operations of Company and its Subsidiaries are and
have been maintained and conducted, in all material respects, in compliance
with all applicable Rules.

3.14 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
knows of any basis for the assertion against them of any liability, obligation
or claim (including, without limitation, that of any Governmental Entity) that
is likely to result in or cause a Material Adverse Effect that is not fairly
reflected in the Financial Statements of Company or otherwise disclosed in
this Agreement.

3.15 _Accounting Records; Disclosure Controls; Internal Controls_.

(a) Each of Company and its Subsidiaries maintains accounting records which
fairly and validly reflect, in all material respects, their transactions and
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that such
transactions are (i) executed in accordance with its managements general or
specific authorization, and (ii) recorded as necessary to permit the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Such records, to
the extent they contain material information pertaining to Company or its
Subsidiaries which is not easily and readily available elsewhere, have been
duplicated, and such duplicates are stored safely and securely.

(b) Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by Company is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of the Companys SEC Reports and other public
disclosure documents. The Company maintains internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under
the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is
effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the asset of Company,
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and
that receipts and expenditures of Company are being made only in accordance
with  



 

23  authorizations of management and directors of Company, and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Companys assets that could
have a material effect on its financial statements.

(c) Company has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its chief
executive officer and its chief financial officer prior to the date hereof, to
Companys auditors and the audit committee of Companys board of directors (A)
any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of its internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and has identified for Companys auditors and audit committee of
Companys board of directors any material weaknesses in internal control over
financial reporting and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. Company has made available to
Seller (i) a summary of any such disclosure made by management to Companys
auditors and audit committee since January 1, 2005 and (ii) any material
communication since January 1, 2005 made by management or Companys auditors
to the audit committee required or contemplated by listing standards of
Nasdaq, the audit committees charter or professional standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board. Since January 1, 2005, no material
complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls
or auditing matters, and no concerns from Company employees regarding
questionable accounting or auditing matters, have been received by Company.
Company has made available to Seller a summary of all material complaints or
concerns relating to other matters made since January 1, 2005
through Companys whistleblower hot-line or equivalent system for receipt of
employee concerns regarding possible violations of Rule. No attorney
representing Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation
of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Company
or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to Companys chief
legal officer, audit committee (or other committee designated for the
purpose) of the board of directors or the board of directors pursuant to the
Rules in adopted pursuant to Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any
Company policy contemplating such reporting, including in instances not
required by those Rules.

3.16 _Absence of Adverse Agreements_. Neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement or instrument, nor is Company or any
such Subsidiary subject to any judgment, order, decree or Rule of any court or
other Governmental Entity or authority which now or in the future may have a
Materially Adverse Effect.

 

3.17 _Disclosure_. Neither the Company Financial Statements nor any
representation or warranty contained herein, nor any information delivered
or to be delivered by Company pursuant to this Agreement, contains or shall
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

3.18 _Bank Secrecy Act_. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been
advised of any supervisory concerns regarding their compliance with the Bank
Secrecy Act (31 USC 5322, et seq.) or related state or federal anti-money
laundering laws, regulations and guidelines,  



 

24  including without limitation those provisions of federal regulations
requiring (a) the filing of reports, such as Currency Transaction Reports
and Suspicious Activity Reports, (b) the maintenance of records and (c) the
exercise of due diligence in identifying customers.

3.19  _Brokers and Finders_. Except as provided in Companys Disclosure
Letter with copies of any such written agreements attached, neither Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or obligated under any agreement
with any broker or finder relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
and neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions provided for herein or therein will result in any liability by
Company or its Subsidiaries to any broker or finder.

3.20 _Insurance_. Company and its Subsidiaries have policies of insurance and
bonds covering their assets and businesses against such casualties and
contingencies and in such amounts, types and forms as are customary in the
banking industry for their business, operations, properties and assets. All
such insurance policies and bonds are in full force and effect. Except as set
forth in Companys Disclosure Letter, neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received notice from any insurer that any such policy or bond
has canceled or indicating an intention to cancel or not to renew any such
policy or bond or generally disclaiming liability thereunder. Except as set
forth in Companys Disclosure Letter, neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in default under any such policy or bond and all material
claims thereunder have been filed in a timely fashion. The existing insurance
carried by Company and its Subsidiaries are sufficient for compliance by them
with all material requirements of law and regulations and agreements to which
they are subject or are a party.

3.21 _Taxes_. Except as set forth in Companys Disclosure Letter, Company and
its Subsidiaries have filed all federal and foreign income tax returns, all
state and local franchise and income tax, real and personal property tax,
sales and use tax, premium tax, excise tax and other tax returns of every
character required to be filed by them and have paid all taxes, together with
any interest and penalties owing in connection therewith, shown on such
returns to be due in respect of the periods covered by such returns, other
than taxes which are being contested in good faith and for which adequate
reserves have been established. Except as set forth in Companys Disclosure
Letter, Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all required payroll tax
returns, have fulfilled all tax withholding obligations and have paid over to
the appropriate governmental authorities the proper amounts with respect to
the foregoing. The tax and audit positions taken by Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the tax returns described in the preceding
sentences were reasonable and asserted in good faith. Adequate provision has
been made in the books and records of Company or its Subsidiaries and, to the
extent required by GAAP, reflected in the Financial Statements of Company, for
all tax liabilities, including interest or penalties, whether or not due and
payable and whether or not disputed, with respect to any and all federal,
foreign, state, local and other taxes for the periods covered by such
financial statements and for all prior periods. Except as set forth in
Companys Disclosure Letter, to the knowledge of Company and its
Subsidiaries, neither the IRS nor any foreign, state, local or other taxing
authority has, during the past three years, examined or is in the process of
examining any federal, foreign, state, local or other tax returns of Company
and its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of Company and its Subsidiaries,
neither the IRS  



 

25  nor any foreign, state, local or other taxing authority is now asserting or
threatening to assert any deficiency or claim for additional taxes (or
interest thereon or penalties in connection therewith) except as set forth in
Companys Disclosure Letter.

3.22 _Loan Portfolio_. Companys Disclosure Letter sets forth a description
of: (a) by type and classification, all loans, leases, other extensions and
commitments to extend credit of Company Bank of $100,000 or more, that have
been classified by itself, any external loan reviewer or grader, its bank
examiners or auditors (external or internal) as "Watch List," "Substandard,"
"Doubtful," "Loss" or any comparable classification; and (b) all loans due
to Company Bank as to which any payment of principal, interest or any other

to carry on their respective businesses as presently conducted. Neither the
scope of the business of Seller or its Subsidiaries nor the location of any

stock of Seller consists of 10,000,000 shares, of which 2,827,881 shares are
outstanding. All the outstanding shares of Seller Stock are duly authorized,

note, bond, mortgage, indenture, franchise, license, permit, agreement,
Encumbrances or other instrument or obligation to which Seller is a party, or

or its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of Seller and its Subsidiaries, neither
Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries are a party to any pending or, to the

Sellers Disclosure Letter, Seller and its Subsidiaries have filed all
required payroll tax returns, have fulfilled all tax withholding obligations
and have paid over to the appropriate governmental authorities the proper
amounts with respect to the foregoing. The tax and audit positions taken by

financial statements and for all prior periods. Sellers Disclosure Letter
sets forth (i) the date or dates through which the IRS has examined the

30  returns of Seller and its Subsidiaries and the date or dates through which
any foreign, state, local or other taxing authority has examined any other

interest thereon or penalties in connection therewith) except as set forth in
Sellers Disclosure Letter.

4.11 _Compliance with Laws and Regulations_. Except as set forth in
Sellers Disclosure Letter, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries are in
default under or in breach of any provision of their Charter Documents or any

all of the obligations required to be performed by them to date and are not
in material default under or in breach of any term or provision of any
material contract, and no event has occurred that, with the giving of notice
or the passage of time or both, would constitute such default or breach. To
Seller and its Subsidiaries knowledge, no party with whom any of them have
an agreement that is material to their business is in default thereunder.

4.13 _Employees_. There are no controversies pending or threatened between
Seller and its Subsidiaries and any of their employees that are likely to have

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

4.16 _Licenses and Permits_. Each of Seller and its Subsidiaries has all
licenses and permits necessary for the conduct of their business, and
such licenses are in full force and effect, except for any failure to be in

properties and operations of Seller and its Subsidiaries are and have been
maintained and conducted, in all material respects, in compliance with all
applicable Rules.

4.17 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries
knows of any basis for the assertion against them of any liability, obligation
or claim (including, without limitation, that of any Governmental Entity) that
is likely to result in or cause a Material Adverse Effect that is not
fairly reflected in the Financial Statements of Seller or otherwise disclosed
in this Agreement.

4.18 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in Sellers Disclosure Letter, neither Seller nor any
if its Subsidiaries has any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA, any "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA,
any "defined benefit pension plan" within the meaning of Section 3(35) of
ERISA nor has Seller or any of its Subsidiaries ever sponsored or maintained
any such plan.

(b) Sellers Disclosure Letter sets forth copies and descriptions of
each Benefit Arrangement maintained or otherwise contributed to by Seller and
its Subsidiaries (such plans and arrangements being collectively referred to
herein as "Seller Benefit Arrangements"). Except as set forth in Sellers
Disclosure Letter, there has been no material amendment thereof or increase
in the cost thereof or benefits payable thereunder since December 31, 2005.
Except as set forth in Sellers Disclosure Letter, there has been no material
increase in the compensation of or benefits payable to any senior executive
employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries since December 31, 2005, nor any
employment, severance or similar contract entered into with any such employee,
nor any amendment to any such contract, since December 31, 2005. Except as
set forth in Sellers Disclosure Letter, there is no contract, agreement or
benefit arrangement covering any employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries which
individually or collectively could give rise to the payment of any amount
which would constitute an "excess parachute payment," as such term is defined
in Section 280(G) of the Code.

(c) With respect to all Seller Benefit Arrangements, Seller and its
Subsidiaries are in substantial compliance (other than noncompliance the cost
or liability for which is not material) with the requirements prescribed by
any and all statutes, governmental or court orders, or governmental rules or
regulations currently in effect, applicable to such plans or arrangements.

(d) Except for the contracts set forth in Sellers Disclosure Letter, each
Seller Benefit Arrangement and each personal services contract, fringe
benefit, consulting contract or similar  



 

32  arrangement with or for the benefit of any officer, director, employee or
other person can be terminated by Seller or its Subsidiaries within a period
of 30 days following the Effective Time of the Merger, without payment of any
amount as a penalty, bonus, premium, severance pay or other compensation for
such termination.

(e) Notwithstanding any statement or indication in this Agreement to the
contrary, except as set forth on Sellers Disclosure Letter, there are no
Seller Benefit Arrangements as to which Seller or Company will be required to
make any contribution or to make any other payments, whether on behalf of any
of the current employees, directors or officers of Seller and its Subsidiaries
or on behalf of any other person after the Closing. Seller has no formal plan
or commitment, whether legally binding or not, to create any additional
Benefit Arrangement, or to modify or change any existing Seller Benefit
Arrangement.

(f) None of the Seller Benefit Arrangements nor any trust created thereunder
has ever incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" as such term is defined
in Section 412 of the Code, whether or not waived. Furthermore, Seller and
its Subsidiaries have no unfunded liability under ERISA in respect of any of
the Benefit Arrangements. Seller and its Subsidiaries have made all
contributions and paid all amounts due and owing under all of the
Seller Benefit Arrangements. Each of the Seller Benefit Arrangements that is
intended to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code has received
a favorable determination letter that it is so qualified from the Internal
Revenue Service and Seller does not know of any fact, which could adversely
affect the qualified status of any such Benefit Arrangement. All amendments
required to bring all of the Seller Benefit Arrangements into conformity with
all of the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code, COBRA, HIPAA and all
other applicable laws have been made. All contributions required to be made to
each of the Seller Benefit Arrangements under the terms of the Benefit
Arrangement, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable laws have been timely
made. The Financial Statements of Seller and its Subsidiaries properly reflect
all amounts required to be accrued as liabilities to date under each of the
Seller Benefit Arrangements.

(g) There has not occurred and there does not exist (i) any pending litigation
or controversy against any of the Seller Benefit Arrangements or against
Seller and/or its Subsidiaries as the "Employer" or "Sponsor" under the
Benefit Arrangements or against the trustee, fiduciaries or administrators of
any of the Benefit Arrangements or (ii) any pending or
threatened investigation, proceeding, lawsuit, dispute, action or
controversies involving any of the Seller Benefit Arrangements, the
administrator or trustee of any of the Benefit Arrangements with any of the
Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor, Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, any participant in the Benefit Arrangements, any service provider
to any of the Benefit Arrangements or any other person whatsoever.

(h) Seller and its Subsidiaries have not used the services of (i) workers who
have been provided by a third party contract labor supplier for more than six
months or who may otherwise be eligible to participate in any of the Seller
Benefit Arrangements or to an extent that would reasonably be expected to
result in the disqualification or loss of preferred tax status of any of the
Seller Benefit Arrangements or the imposition of penalties or excise
taxes with respect to the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor,
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any  



 

33  other governmental entity; (ii) temporary employees who have worked for more
than six months or who may otherwise be eligible to participate in any of the
Seller Benefit Arrangements or to an extent that would reasonably be expected
to result in the disqualification or loss of preferred tax status of any of
the Seller Benefit Arrangements or the imposition of penalties or excise taxes
with respect to the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor, Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other governmental entity; (iii)
individuals who have provided services to Seller and its Subsidiaries as
independent contractors for more than six months or who may otherwise be
eligible to participate in any of the Seller Benefit Arrangements or to an
extent that would reasonably be expected to result in the disqualification or
loss of preferred tax status of any of the Seller Benefit Arrangements or the
imposition of penalties or excise taxes with respect to the Internal Revenue
Service, Department of Labor, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any
other governmental entity or (iv) leased employees, as that term is defined
in section 414(n) of the Code.

4.19 _SEC Reports_. As of the respective dates, since September 23, 2004,
Seller has filed all SEC Reports required to be filed by it and none of
Sellers SEC Reports contained at the time of filing any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstance under which they were made, not misleading. Each of Sellers SEC
Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished complied, or if not yet
filed or furnished, will comply, in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and any Rules
promulgated thereunder applicable to Sellers SEC Reports.

4.20 _Accounting Records; Disclosure Controls; Internal Controls_.

(a) Each of Seller and its Subsidiaries maintains accounting records which
fairly and validly reflect, in all material respects, their transactions and
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that such
transactions are (i) executed in accordance with its managements general or
specific authorization, and (ii) recorded as necessary to permit the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Such records,
to the extent they contain material information pertaining to Seller and its
Subsidiaries, which is not easily, and readily available elsewhere, have been
duplicated, and such duplicates are stored safely and securely.

(b) Seller maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by Seller is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of the Sellers SEC Reports and
other public disclosure documents. The Seller maintains internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under
the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is effective
in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the asset of Seller, (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary  



 

34  to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and
that receipts and expenditures of Seller are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of Seller, and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of Sellers assets that could have a material
effect on its financial statements.

(c) Seller has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its chief
executive officer and its chief financial officer prior to the date hereof,
to Sellers auditors and the audit committee of Sellers board of directors
(A) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of its internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Sellers ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and has identified for Sellers auditors and audit committee of
Sellers board of directors any material weaknesses in internal control over
financial reporting and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Sellers
internal control over financial reporting. Seller has made available to
Company (i) a summary of any such disclosure made by management to Sellers
auditors and audit committee since January 1, 2005 and (ii) any material
communication since January 1, 2005 made by management or Sellers auditors
to the audit committee required or contemplated by listing standards of
Nasdaq, the audit committees charter or professional standards of the Public
Seller Accounting Oversight Board. Since January 1, 2005, no material
complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls
or auditing matters, and no concerns from Seller employees regarding
questionable accounting or auditing matters, have been received by Seller.
Seller has made available to Company a summary of all material complaints or
concerns relating to other matters made since January 1, 2005 through Sellers
whistleblower hot-line or equivalent system for receipt of employee concerns
regarding possible violations of Rule. No attorney representing Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities laws, breach
of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Seller or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to Sellers chief legal officer, audit
committee (or other committee designated for the purpose) of the board of
directors or the board of directors pursuant to the Rules in adopted pursuant
to Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Seller policy contemplating
such reporting, including in instances not required by those Rules.

4.21 _Loan Portfolio_. Sellers Disclosure Letter sets forth a description of:
(a) by type and classification, all loans, leases, other extensions and
commitments to extend credit of Seller Bank of $100,000 or more, that have
been classified by itself, any external loan reviewer or grader, its bank
examiners or auditors (external or internal) as "Watch List," "Substandard,"

until the time provided in Section 9.1(b) for continuing employees to
participate in Company Benefit Arrangements. The Parties acknowledge

Bank to execute the Plan of Bank Merger. Seller shall vote all shares of

least twenty-five percent (25%) of the outstanding shares of Seller Stock; a
solicitation of proxies in opposition to approval of the Merger by Seller
stockholders; or a public announcement by another Person (besides the Company)
of an unsolicited _bona fide_ proposal, plan, or intention to do any of the
foregoing. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 6.12 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, nothing shall prevent Seller from (i) engaging in
any discussions or negotiations with, or providing any information to, any
Person in response to an unsolicited _bona fide_ written proposal concerning
a Competing Transaction by such Person or (ii) recommending such an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written proposal concerning a Competing Transaction to
the holders of Seller Stock if and only if, prior to participating in any of
the foregoing, (A) the board of directors of Seller concludes in good faith
that the Competing Transaction is reasonably likely to be consummated in
accordance with its  



 

52  terms, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of
the proposal and the Person making the proposal, and, if consummated, would
result in a transaction more favorable to holders of Seller Stock from a
financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement;
(B) the board of directors of Seller determines in good faith, taking into
consideration the written advice of outside counsel, that participating in
any such action is necessary or advisable for it to act in a manner not
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and (C) at least
48 hours prior to providing any information or data to any Person or entering
into discussion or negotiations with any Person, the board of directors of
Seller notifies Company of such inquiries, proposals or offers received by,
any information requested from, or any such discussion or negotiations sought
to be initiated or continued with Seller and thereafter shall keep Company
informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or
offers and the status of any discussions or negotiations.

6.13 _Affiliates_. Within thirty (30) days of the execution of this Agreement,
(a) Seller shall deliver to Company a letter identifying all persons who are
then "affiliates" of Seller for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act

written agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E.

affiliate of Seller after Sellers delivery of the letter referred to above,
and on or prior to the date of the Seller Stockholders Meeting to approve
this Agreement, a written agreement substantially in the form attached as
Exhibit E hereto as soon as practicable after obtaining such status.

Effective Day, Seller shall afford to Company and its authorized agents and
representatives, access, during normal business hours, to the operations,
books, and other information relating to Seller for the sole purpose of
assuring an orderly transition of operations, including any data processing
conversion, in the Merger. Company shall give reasonable notice for access to
Seller, and the date and time of such access will then be mutually agreed to
by Company and Seller. Companys access shall be conducted in a manner which
does not unreasonably interfere with Sellers normal operations, customers and
employee relations and which does not interfere with the ability of Seller to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.15 _Access to Employees._ Company shall have the right, but not the
obligation, within thirty (30) Business Days prior to the Effective Day, to
provide training to employees of Seller who will become employees of Company.
Such training shall be at the expense of Company and shall be conducted during
normal business hours, or, if the foregoing is not possible, after business
hours at a location reasonably requested by Company. At the request of
Company, Company shall compensate employees, in accordance with Sellers
customary policies and practices, for the employees time being trained
by Company. Seller shall cooperate with Company to make such employees
available for such training prior to Closing. Training shall not  



 

53  exceed 40 hours per employee. All travel and other reimbursable expense
incurred by the employee for training are Companys responsibility. Nothing
in this Section is intended, nor shall it be construed, to confer any rights
or benefits upon any persons other than Company or Seller.

6.16  _Stock Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall (a) use its
best efforts to cause each holder of Seller Stock Options, as listed in its
Disclosure Letter, who has not exercised their option and who will not receive
a substitute stock option pursuant to Section 9.2, to enter into an agreement
providing for the cancellation and termination of any unexercised options
prior to the Effective Time in exchange for the consideration set forth in
Section 2.8 and (b) take all actions necessary to terminate the Seller Stock
Option Plan, such termination to be effective at the Effective Time. Each
holder of such canceled Seller Stock Option shall acknowledge that upon
payment of such amount set forth in Section 2.8, no further liability shall
accrue to Seller or any successor thereto.

each Party shall be the sole responsibility of that Party. Each of the parties
will use its respective best efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after it is filed. Company
shall pay all third party costs (except Sellers legal and accounting fees)

to file with the SEC and have declared effective or cleared by the SEC any
amendment or supplement to the S-4 so as to correct such information and to
cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected to be disseminated to the

of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were  



 

55  made, not misleading. Any financial statement contained in any such report,
registration statement or other filing that is intended to represent
the financial position of the entities or entity to which it relates will
fairly present the financial position of such entities or entity and will be

action as may be reasonable or necessary to consummate the Merger and the

after the Effective Time) and reflect Companys plans with respect to the
conduct of Sellers business following the Merger and to provide for the costs
and expenses relating to the consummation by Seller of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The establishment of such accrual and

required Consent from the FRB, the DFI and, at or prior to the Effective

59  fees and expenses of all attorneys, accountants, investment bankers and
other advisors and agents for the Seller for services rendered in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

8.3 _Additional Conditions to Obligations of Seller to Close_. The obligations
of Seller to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
herein are subject to the satisfaction or waiver, at or prior to the Effective
Time, of each of the following conditions:

(a) All actions necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement, consummation of the Merger and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been duly and
validly taken by the respective boards of directors and stockholders of
Company.

(b) The representations and warranties of Company contained in Article 3 of
this Agreement shall be true and correct (i) on the date of this Agreement;
and (ii) at and as of the Effective Time as though all such representations
and warranties had been made at and as of such time, except with respect to
representations and warranties that, by their terms, speak as of a different
time; and Seller shall have received a certificate to that effect dated
the Effective Time and executed on behalf of Company by its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer. For purposes of this paragraph, such
representations and warranties shall be deemed to be true and correct unless
the failure or failures of such representations and warranties to be true and
correct in all material respects, either individually or in the aggregate, and
without giving effect to any materiality, material adverse effect or similar
qualifications set forth in such representations and warranties, will have or
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the ability of Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

(c) The covenants and agreements of Company to be performed at or before the
Effective Time shall have been duly performed in all material respects; and
Seller shall have received one or more certificates to that effect dated the
Effective Time and executed by the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of Company.

(d) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
no event shall have occurred or circumstance arisen that, individually
or taken together with all other facts, circumstances or events, has had or
could reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
whether or not such event, change or effect is reflected in Companys
Disclosure Letters to this Agreement, as amended or supplemented, after the
date of this Agreement; and Seller shall have received a certificate to that
effect dated the Effective Time and signed by the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of Company. 



 

60 ARTICLE 9

_EMPLOYEE BENEFITS_

9.1 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) Following the Effective Time, certain employees of Seller will have the
opportunity to continue their at-will employment with Company Bank if and
to the extent that mutually suitable job opportunities are available with
Company Bank at the former offices of Seller Bank or another office of Company
Bank. Company will cause to be made offers of employment to such employees as
soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement; provided, however,
that nothing herein contained shall be deemed to change any employees at-will
status nor to create a contract of employment with any such employee.

(b) Upon the later to occur of (i) December 31, 2006 or (ii) as soon as
possible after the Effective Time, Company shall make available to all
continuing employees of Seller an opportunity to participate in the Company
Benefit Arrangements on the same basis as other similarly situated employees
of Company or Company Bank. Except in connection with equity compensation
plans, each of these employees will be credited for eligibility,
participation and vesting purposes (provided that no more than the maximum
days of sick leave provided in the Company sick leave program may be carried
over), with such employees respective years of past service with Seller (or
other prior service so credited by Seller) as though they had been employees
of Company.

(c) After the Closing, Company expects to convert or merge Sellers 401(k)
plan into or with another tax-qualified plan, such as the Companys 401(k)
plan, in a manner that will not cause adverse tax consequences for
Sellers participants.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) the annual
bonus for Sellers President and Chief Executive Officer shall be calculated
as of September 30, 2006, consistent with Sellers past practice (i.e. based
on core earnings and without deduction for any Professional Fees or additional
expenses incurred in connection with the merger) and shall be paid on October
15, 2006, and (ii) Seller may continue to accrue amounts in its employee bonus
plan consistent with Sellers past practice, and bonuses payable under such
plan shall be paid on the earlier of Closing or December 15, 2006, to such
employees and in such proportions as are consistent with Sellers past
practice.

9.2  _Substitute Stock Options_. Company shall grant, as of the Effective
Time, substitute stock options to each of those Seller employees who will
continue their employ with Company Bank and who has at the Effective Time an
outstanding Seller Stock Option and who has not elected to receive cash or
stock pursuant to Section 2.8. Each substitute stock option so granted by
Company to replace a Seller Stock Option shall be 100% vested and shall be
exercisable for that number of whole shares of Company Stock equal to the
product of (A) the  



 

61  number of shares of Seller Stock that were purchasable under such Seller
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B)
the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Company Stock. Further, each substitute stock option so granted by Company to
replace a Seller Stock Option shall provide for a per share exercise price
which shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing (A) the exercise
price per share of Seller Stock at which such Seller Stock Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio.
Each substitute option shall have a duration equal to the remaining duration
of the Seller Stock Option for which it is substituted. Any substitute option
granted by the Company to replace a Seller Stock Option which is an incentive
stock option will, to the extent legally permissible, be an incentive stock
option. Company Stock issued pursuant to substitute options shall have been
registered under the Securities Act; provided, however, the Company shall be
under no obligation to file a registration statement under the Securities Act
to cover resales by affiliates.

ARTICLE 10

_TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT; WAIVER OF CONDITIONS_

10.1 _Termination of Agreement_. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
including the Merger may be terminated at any time before the Effective Time,
whether before or after approval by the stockholders of Seller as follows,
and in no other manner:

(a) By mutual Consent of Company and Seller;

(b) By Company or Seller, (i) if any conditions set forth in Section 8.1 shall
not have been met by February 28, 2007, or (ii) upon the expiration of 20
Business Days after any Governmental Entity denies or refuses to grant any
approval, Consent or authorization required to be obtained in order to
consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement unless, within said
20 Business Day period after such denial or refusal, the Parties hereto agree
to resubmit the application to the Governmental Entity that has denied, or
refused to grant the approval, Consent or authorization requested;

(c) By Company, if any conditions set forth in Section 8.2 shall not have been
met, or by Seller, if any conditions set forth in Section 8.3 shall not have
been met, by February 28, 2007, or such earlier time as it becomes apparent
that such condition cannot be met;



 

62 (d) By Company, if Seller should (i) materially breach any of its
representations or warranties contained herein or (ii) materially default in
the observance or in the due and timely performance of any of its covenants
and agreements herein contained, and in either case, such breach and/or
default shall not have been fully cured within 20 Business Days from the date
of delivery of written notice specifying the alleged breach and/or default;

(e) By Seller, if Company should (i) materially breach any of its
representation or warranties contained herein or (ii) materially default in
the observance or in the due and timely performance of any of their covenants
and agreements herein contained, and in either case, such breach and/or
default shall not have been fully cured within 20 Business Days from the date
of delivery of written notice specifying the alleged breach and/or default;

(f) By Company, if the stockholders of Seller fail to approve this Agreement
and the Merger by the requisite vote at the Seller Stockholders Meeting, or
by Seller, if the stockholders of Company fail to approve this Agreement and
the Merger by the requisite vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting; or

(g) By Seller, if (1) there has been a Significant Decline in the price of
Company Stock, measured by the Average Closing Price, (2) such decline is not
Proportionate Relative to the Nasdaq Bank Index (the "Index"), (3) Seller
delivers written notice to Company of its intention to terminate this
Agreement within two (2) Business Days after the end of the Company Measuring
Period (a "Termination Notice") and (4) Company does not elect to pursue a
Decline Adjustment as set forth below; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if
Company effects a stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction after the date
hereof and prior to the date on which the Average Closing Price is determined,
the provisions of this Section shall be appropriately adjusted so that such
event does not in and of itself trigger a termination right on behalf of
Seller. For purposes hereof, the following terms have the following meanings:
"Final Index" shall mean the average of the closing prices of the Index for
the twenty trading-day Company Measuring Period, a "Significant Decline"
shall be deemed to have occurred if the Average Closing Price is less than the
product of (i) the Company Initial Price and (ii) .825, which is referred to
as the "Minimum Adjustment Price", and a decrease is not "Proportionate
Relative to the Index" if the quotient obtained by dividing the Average
Closing Price by the Company Initial Price is less than the quotient obtained
by dividing the Final Index by the Initial Index and subtracting 0.175 from
the quotient. Notwithstanding any decrease in the price of Company Stock, as
set forth in this Section, Seller shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section if Company elects, no later than the close
of business on the next succeeding Business Day after the receipt of a
Termination Notice, to fix the Per Share Cash Consideration at $43.13 (a
"Decline Adjustment").

10.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement shall be
terminated pursuant to Section 10.1 hereof, all further obligations of the
Parties hereto under this Agreement shall terminate without further liability
of any Party to another; provided, however, that no  



 

63  termination of this Agreement under Section 10.1 for any reason or in any
manner shall release, or be construed as so releasing, any Party from
its obligations under Sections 11.1, 11.9 or 11.10, hereof and
notwithstanding the foregoing if such termination shall result from the
willful failure of a Party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the
obligations of any other Party or to perform a covenant of such Party in this
Agreement, such Party shall, subject to the provision of Section 11.1, be
fully liable for any and all damages, costs and expenses (including, but not
limited to, reasonable attorneys fees sustained or incurred by the other
Party in connection with negotiating and implementing the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement).

10.3 _Waiver of Conditions_. If any of the conditions specified in Section 8.2
have not been satisfied, Company may nevertheless, at its election, proceed
with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. If any of
the conditions specified in Section 8.3 have not been satisfied, Seller may
nevertheless, at its election, proceed with the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement. If any Party elects to proceed pursuant to the provisions
hereof, the conditions that are unsatisfied immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be deemed to be satisfied, as evidence by a certificate
delivered by the electing Party.

ARTICLE 11

_GENERAL_

11.1 _Expenses/Termination_Expenses_.

(a) Seller hereby agrees that if this Agreement is terminated by Company

pursuant to Section 10.1(e), Company shall promptly, and in any event within
seven (7) Business Days after such termination, pay Seller $500,000.

(c) Seller hereby agrees that if (i) (X) the board of directors of Seller
fails to recommend approval of this Agreement and the Merger to the
stockholders of Seller or effects a Change in Recommendation, and this
Agreement and the Merger are not approved by the stockholders of Seller by
the requisite vote at the Seller Stockholders Meeting, or (Y) a Competing
Transaction is proposed between the date hereof and the time of the Seller
Stockholders Meeting and the stockholders of Seller fail to approve this
Agreement and the Merger under circumstances where the board of directors of
Seller continuously maintained its favorable recommendation of this Agreement
and the Merger, or (Z) this Agreement is terminated after a Competing
Transaction is proposed and (ii) after the occurrence of (X), (Y) or (Z),
either a definitive agreement relating to a Competing Transaction is executed
by Seller, or a  



 

64  Competing Transaction is consummated, within 12 months after the termination
of this Agreement, then, upon the earlier to happen of the entering into of
a definitive agreement for a Competing Transaction or of the consummating of
the Competing Transaction, Seller shall promptly (and in no event later than
two (2) Business days) pay Company a termination fee of $4,000,000,
representing liquidated damages, payable by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified by Company. Any payment made by Seller
pursuant to Section 11.1(a) shall be credited against the amount due by Seller
under this sub-section.

 

(d) The amounts set forth in Section 11.1(a), (b) and (c) are in the nature of
liquidated damages and do not constitute a penalty. The Parties agree that it
would be impracticable or extremely difficult to fix actual damages and the
amounts set forth in Section 11.1(a), (b) and (c) are reasonably intended to
compensate for expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement and any lost opportunity resulting from the pendency of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Upon payment of an amount by a
Party pursuant to Section 11.1(a), (b) and (c), the other Party waives any
and all rights to any payments, damages, amounts, costs, fees or other
expenses, and agrees that it shall not bring any action, suit or proceeding of
any kind to recover any amounts in connection with any breach of this
Agreement. If any Party fails to promptly pay the other Party any amounts due
under Section 11.1 within the time period specified therein, the defaulting
Party shall pay all costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by
the other Party from the date such amounts were required to be paid in
connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to
collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on the amount of any
such unpaid amounts at the publicly announced prime rate of interest printed
in The Wall Street Journal on the date such payment was required to be made.

(e) Except as otherwise provided herein and in Section 7.1, all expenses
incurred by Company or Seller in connection with or related to the
authorization, preparation and execution of this Agreement, the solicitation
of stockholder approvals and all other matters related to the closing of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation of the
generality of the foregoing, all fees and expenses of agents, representatives,
counsel, and accountants employed by either of the Parties or its affiliates,
shall be borne solely and entirely by the Party which has incurred the same.

11.2 _Amendments_. To the fullest extent permitted by law, this Agreement may
be amended by agreement in writing of the Parties hereto at any time prior to
the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of this Agreement by the
stockholders of Seller.



 

65 11.3 _Disclosure Letter; Exhibits; Integration_. Each Disclosure Letter and
exhibit delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall
constitute a part of the Agreement, although Disclosure Letters need not be
attached to each copy of this Agreement. This Agreement, together with such
Disclosure Letters, and exhibits constitute the entire agreement between the
Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
agreements and understanding of the Parties in connection therewith.

11.4 _Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with the other and use its reasonable
best efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to

advisable on its part under this Agreement or under applicable Rule to
consummate and make effective the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, including the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article 8 hereof.

11.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the legal relations between the
Parties shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of Nevada except to the extent that the provisions of federal law are
mandatorily applicable. The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Nevada and the federal courts of
the United States of America located in the State of Nevada solely in respect
of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and
of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and hereby waive, and agree to
assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation
or enforcement hereof or of any such documents, that it is not subject thereto
or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is
not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in
or by such courts, and the Parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims
with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in
such Nevada state or federal court. The Parties hereby consent to and grant
any such court jurisdiction over the person of such Parties and over the
subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided
in Section 11.12 or in such other manner as may be permitted by law, shall be
valid and sufficient service thereof.

11.6 _No Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, duties or
obligations hereunder shall be assignable by Company or Seller, in whole
or in part, without the prior written Consent of the other Party. Any
attempted assignment in violation of this prohibition shall be null and void.
Subject to the foregoing, all of the terms and provisions hereof shall be
binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors and assigns of the
Parties hereto.

11.7 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are
inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement.



 

66 11.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any exhibit hereto may be executed in
one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each Party hereto and delivered to each Party hereto.

11.9 _Publicity and Reports_. Company and Seller shall coordinate all
publicity relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
no Party shall issue any press release, publicity statement or other public
notice relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby without obtaining the prior Consent of the other Party, except to the
extent that legal counsel to any Party shall deliver a written opinion to the
other Party to the effect that a particular action is required by applicable
Rules.

11.10 _Confidentiality_. All Confidential Information disclosed heretofore or
hereafter by any Party to this Agreement to any other Party to this Agreement
shall be kept confidential by such other Party and shall not be used by
such other Party otherwise than as herein contemplated, except to the extent
that (a) it is necessary or appropriate to disclose to the DFI, the FRB, the
SEC or any other Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over any of the
Parties or as may be otherwise be required by Rule (any disclosure of
Confidential Information to a Governmental Entity shall be accompanied by a
request that such Governmental Entity preserve the confidentiality of such
Confidential Information); or (b) to the extent such duty as to
confidentiality is waived by the other Party. Such obligation as to
confidentiality and non-use shall survive the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article 10. In the event of such termination and on request of
another Party, each Party shall use all reasonable efforts to (1) return to
the other Parties all documents (and reproductions thereof) received from such
other Parties that contain Confidential Information (and, in the case of
reproductions, all such reproductions made by the receiving Party); and (2)
destroy the originals and all copies of any analyses, computations, studies or
other documents prepared for the internal use of such Party that included
Confidential Information.

 

11.11 _Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.1
concerning liquidated damages, Seller and Company each acknowledge that, in
view of the uniqueness of their respective businesses and the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, each Party would not have an adequate remedy
at law for money damages in the event that this Agreement has not
been performed in accordance with its terms, and therefore each Party agrees
that the other shall be entitled to specific enforcement of the terms hereof
in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in
equity.
