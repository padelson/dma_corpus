irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached or the Merger was not consummated, and that money damages would not be an adequate
remedy, even if available. It is accordingly agreed that the parties (on behalf of themselves and the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement provided in <U>Section&nbsp;11.10</U>) shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other
appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties&#146; obligations to consummate the Merger and Parent&#146;s
obligation to pay, and the right of the shareholders of the Company to receive, the Merger Consideration) in any court of competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="center"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">[Signature Page Follows] </FONT></P>
