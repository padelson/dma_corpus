Parent or Merger Sub (" _Excluded Shares_ "), (ii) Common Shares held by any
Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent (other than Merger Sub) and (iii)
Common Shares the holder of which (A) has not voted in favor of the Merger or

9  its rights to be paid the fair value of such Common Shares in accordance
with Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA and (C) has not effectively withdrawn or lost

consideration to be issued to the holders of such Common Shares, the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

(b) _Cancellation of Common Shares_.

 

(i) Each Common Share converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 4.1(a)_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Common Shares
(each, a " _Certificate_ ") or Common Shares represented by book-entry (the "
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
representing Excluded Shares, Dissenting Shares or Common Shares described in
_Section 4.1(b)(iii)_ below) shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate or
transfer of such Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this _Article IV_.

(ii) Each Excluded Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, shall cease to be outstanding and

and shall cease to exist.

(iii) Each Common Share held by any Subsidiary of either the Company
or Parent (other than Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time

Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the
outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following
the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one newly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 4.2  _Exchange of Certificates for Merger Consideration_.

(a) _Paying Agent and Procedures_.

 

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall select a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to Parent as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_
"). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying
Agent, separate and apart from its other funds, for the benefit of holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, cash in an amount equal to the aggregate
Merger Consideration which such holders are entitled to receive pursuant to
this _Article IV_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Merger
Fund_ "). Parent shall be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Paying
Agent.

(ii) The Merger Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent in (i) direct
obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the
full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide
for payment of all principal and interest or (iii) commercial paper
obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investor
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies,
or a combination thereof, as directed by and for the benefit of the Surviving
Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall
affect the amounts payable to the holders of Common Shares following
completion of the Merger pursuant to this _Article IV_ , and Parent shall take
all actions necessary to ensure that the Merger Fund includes at all times
cash sufficient to satisfy Parents obligation under this _Article IV_. Any
and all interest and other income earned on the Merger Fund shall promptly be
paid to the Surviving Corporation.

 

(iii) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event
more than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail

 



10  (and to make available for collection by hand) to each holder of record of
Common Shares (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form
approved by the Company and shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-
Entry Shares to the Paying Agent) and (B) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for the Merger Consideration.

(iv) Upon (A) surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates for cancellation,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
be required pursuant to such instructions or (B) compliance with the
reasonable procedures established by the Paying Agent for delivery of Book-
Entry Shares, each holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, in cash, the aggregate Merger
Consideration in respect thereof in the form of a check to be mailed within
three (3) Business Days of receipt by the Paying Agent of such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, and the Certificates so surrendered and Book-Entry
Shares so transferred shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or due
transfer of the Book-Entry Shares. The Paying Agent shall accept such
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices.

(v) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of the applicable Common Shares may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificates so surrendered or
the Book-Entry Shares so transferred are registered if such Certificates
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such
Book-Entry Shares shall be properly transferred and, in each case, the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect thereof or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 

(b) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of the Common Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
marked canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article IV_.

(c) _Termination of Merger Fund_. Any portion of the Merger Fund that remains
unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and other
eligible Persons in accordance with this  _Article IV_ following one (1) year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon
demand, and any such holder who has not previously complied with this _Article
IV_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation, and the
Surviving Corporation shall remain liable, for payment of any such holders
claim for the Merger Consideration.

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue the
Merger Consideration in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate. Delivery of such affidavit and the posting of such bond shall be
deemed delivery of a Certificate with respect to the relevant Common Shares
for purposes of this _Article IV_.

(e) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall each be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration or other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder or former holder of Common Shares, Restricted Stock Rights or
Options such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold

 



11  with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent and then remitted to the relevant
Taxing Authority on behalf of the former holder of Common Shares, Restricted
Stock Rights or Options, such withheld and remitted amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder or former
holder of the Common Shares, Restricted Stock Rights or Options in respect of
which such deduction, withholding and remittance to the relevant Taxing
Authority was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
as the case may be. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
shall, to the extent reasonable, cooperate with each other and with the former
holders of the Common Shares, Restricted Stock Rights or Options in the
collection, preparation and filing of any forms or other documentation
relating to any claim of exemption or relief from any requirement to withhold
so as to eliminate or minimize to the greatest extent possible any such
requirement.

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any portion of the Merger Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 

(g) _No Other Rights_. Until surrendered or transferred, as applicable, in
accordance with this _Section 4.2_, each Certificate and each Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only
the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, subject to the
Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been authorized by the Company and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.
Any Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of any Certificate or the
transfer of any Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
and the Common Shares formerly represented thereby.

 

Section 4.3 _Treatment of Options and Restricted Stock Rights_.

 

(a) _Options_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder
of any Common Shares or Options, each Option (whether vested or unvested)
shall be fully vested; _provided_ , _however_ , that each Option granted
during calendar year 2013 (a " _2013 Option_ ") shall be vested to the extent
provided in the stock option agreement applicable to such 2013 Option, and
shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
(without interest and less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld
in accordance with _Section 4.2(e)_ with respect to such payment) determined
by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable exercise price per share of such Option by (y) (i) the number of
Common Shares subject to each such Option that is not a 2013 Option or (ii)
the number of Common Shares subject to the vested portion of each 2013 Option,
as applicable.

 

(b) _Restricted Stock Rights_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or any holder of any Common Shares or Restricted Stock Rights, each Restricted
Stock Right (whether vested or unvested) shall be fully vested; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each Restricted Stock Right granted during calendar year
2013 pursuant to a new award made in calendar year 2013 (a " _2013 Restricted
Stock Right_ ") shall be vested to the extent provided in the award agreement
applicable to such 2013 Restricted Stock Right, and shall be canceled, with
the holder of each such Restricted Stock Right becoming entitled to receive an
amount in cash (without interest and less any applicable Taxes required to be
withheld in accordance with _Section 4.2(e)_ with respect to such payment)
equal to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) (i) the
number of Common Shares subject to each such Restricted Stock Right that is
not a 2013 Restricted Stock Right held by such holder immediately prior to
the Effective Time or (ii) the number of Common Shares subject to the vested
portion of each 2013 Restricted Stock Right held by such holder immediately
prior to the Effective time, as applicable.

 

(c) Unless a later time for payment is expressly provided in this _Section
4.3_ or is otherwise agreed between Parent and an individual holder, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Options and

 



12  Restricted Stock Rights the cash payments described in this _Section 4.3_
promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event not later than the fifth
(5th) Business Day after the Effective Time.

 

(d) Except as may otherwise be permitted pursuant to _Section 7.1_, the
Company shall not grant any Option or Restricted Stock Right award on or
after the date hereof.

Section 4.4 _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 4.1(a)_, but rather,
the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to payment of
the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Chapter 23B.13 of
the WBCA (and, at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and such holders shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA); _provided_ , that if any such holder shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
dissent or its dissenters rights under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting
Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable
solely for, the right to receive the Merger Consideration (without interest
thereon) as provided in _Section 4.1(a)_. The Company shall notify Parent as
promptly as reasonably practicable of any written demands received by the
Company for payment of the fair value of any Common Shares and shall provide
Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time,
except as required by Applicable Law, the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 4.5 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that, at any time
during the period from the date hereof to the Effective Time, the Company,
subject to _Section 7.1(d)_, changes (or establishes a record date for
changing) the number of Common Shares issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
subdivision, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction with respect to the outstanding Common Shares, then the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change.

ARTICLE V

except as (i) disclosed in any form, report, schedule, statement or other
document (including all amendments thereto) filed with, or furnished to, the

15 Section 5.6 _Compliance with Laws; Permits; FCC Matters_.

 

(a) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in violation of and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, no written notice has been given of any
violation of, any Applicable Law, except for any violation that, individually
or in the aggregate, has not had, or would not reasonably be expected to have,
a Company Material Adverse Effect. This _Section 5.6(a)_ does not relate to
any employee benefit plan, employment or labor matters, which are the subject
of _Section 5.16_ and _Section 5.17_, or to any tax matters, which are the
subject of _Section 5.12_.

 

(b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (i) have all Permits required to conduct their respective
businesses as now conducted and (ii) are in compliance with all such Permits.

(c) The Company Subsidiaries identified on _Section 5.6(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter are the holders of the FCC Licenses, which constitute all of
the FCC Licenses of the Stations. Such FCC Licenses are in full force and
effect and have not been revoked, suspended, canceled, rescinded, terminated
or expired. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have (i) operated each
Station in compliance with the Communications Laws and the FCC Licenses in
all material respects, (ii) timely filed all material registrations and
reports required to have been filed with the FCC relating to the FCC Licenses,
(iii) paid or caused to be paid all FCC regulatory fees due in respect to
each Station and (iv) completed or caused to be completed the construction of
all facilities or changes contemplated by any of the FCC Licenses or
construction Permits issued to modify the FCC Licenses. There are no
material applications, petitions, proceedings, or other material actions,
complaints or investigations, pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened before the FCC relating to the Stations, other than proceedings
affecting broadcast stations generally. None of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, nor any of the Stations, has entered into a tolling agreement or
otherwise waived any statute of limitations relating to the Stations during
which the FCC may assess any fine or forfeiture or take any other action or
agreed to any extension of time with respect to any FCC investigation or
proceeding. There is not (i) pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, any action by or before the FCC to revoke, suspend, cancel,
rescind or materially adversely modify any such FCC License (other than
proceedings to amend the FCC Rules of general applicability) or (ii) issued or
outstanding, by or before the FCC, any (A) order to show cause, (B) notice of
violation, (C) notice of apparent liability or (D) order of forfeiture, in
each case, against the Stations, the Company or any Company Subsidiary with
respect to the Stations that would reasonably be expected to result in any
action described in the foregoing clause (i) with respect to such FCC
Licenses. Such FCC Licenses have been issued for the terms expiring as
indicated on _Section 5.6(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and the FCC
Licenses are not subject to any condition except for those conditions
appearing on the face of the FCC Licenses and conditions applicable to
broadcast licenses generally or otherwise disclosed in _Section 5.6(c)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter. To the Companys Knowledge, there are no facts
or circumstances relating to the Stations, the Company or any of its
Affiliates, which would reasonably be expected to (a) result in the FCCs
refusal to grant the FCC Consent or otherwise disqualify Parent, (b)
materially delay the obtaining of the FCC Consent or (c) cause the FCC to
impose any material condition on its granting of the FCC Consent. The Company
has no reason to believe that the FCC Applications might be challenged or
might not be granted by the FCC in the ordinary course due to any fact or
circumstance relating to the Company, any Company Subsidiary, the Companys or
any Company Subsidiarys operation of the Stations or the FCC Licensees.

access during normal business hours and without undue disruption of
normal business activity during the period prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement to all of its books,

and other data and information as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
that (i) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to
provide access to (A) any information that is competitively sensitive, (B) any
information that would reasonably be expected to result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege with respect to such information ( _provided_ , that
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such
access or disclosure in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege), (C) any information that would
result in a breach of an agreement to which the Company or any of the Company

of the Company after consultation with counsel, would violate any Applicable

which the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Parent or
any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties, (ii) no
investigation pursuant to this _Section 8.1_ shall affect any representations
or warranties made herein or the conditions to the obligations of

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, the Company
shall, with the assistance of Parent, prepare, and the Company shall file
with the SEC, a proxy statement relating to the approval of this Agreement by
the shareholders of the Company (as amended or supplemented from time to time,
the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Parent and the Company shall cooperate with one
another in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement and shall
furnish all information concerning such party as the other party may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement.
Parent and the Company shall each use

 



31  commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, is discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by Applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company.

Section 8.3 _Company Shareholders  Meeting_. The Company shall, in accordance
with its Constituent Documents and Applicable Law, promptly and duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date upon which the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC, a
meeting of the shareholders of the Company (the " _Company Shareholders 
Meeting_") for the sole purpose of seeking the Company Shareholder Approval
and shall (a) except as otherwise provided in _Section 8.4(b)_, recommend
approval of this Agreement and include in the Proxy Statement such
recommendation and (b) unless an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have
been issued, use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit such approval.
Further, if the Company is unable to obtain a quorum of its shareholders at
the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company may adjourn the
Company Shareholders Meeting if necessary in order to obtain a quorum of its
shareholders.

Section 8.4 _Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or knowingly permit any
Company Subsidiary or any of its or their respective directors, officers or
employees or any Representatives retained by it or any Company Subsidiary to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the
making of any Alternative Transaction Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or
offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction
Proposal or (ii) other than with Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
directors, officers, employees or other Representatives, enter into, continue
or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any Person any non-public information in connection with, any
Alternative Transaction Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, if at any time after the date hereof and prior to the receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval, the Company or any Company Subsidiary receives
an Alternative Transaction Proposal (other than as a result of a

 



32  breach of this _Section 8.4_), the Company and the Company Board may
(directly or through their Representatives) (i) contact such Person and its
advisors for the purpose of clarifying the proposal and any material terms
thereof and the conditions to and likelihood of consummation, so as to
determine whether such proposal is, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a
Superior Proposal and (ii) if the Company Board determines in good faith
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent financial
advisor that such Alternative Transaction Proposal is, or is reasonably likely
to lead to, a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may (x) furnish
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Alternative Transaction Proposal (and its Representatives)
pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement with
confidentiality provisions no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement then in effect;
_provided_ , that a copy of all such information not previously provided to
Parent (or its Representatives) is provided to Parent as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Person making such Alternative Transaction Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Alternative Transaction Proposal. The Company
will within one (1) Business Day provide Parent with all non-public
information regarding the Company that has not previously been provided to
Parent that is provided to any Person making such Alternative Transaction
Proposal. 

(b) The Company Board shall not, directly or indirectly, (i) (A) withdraw (or
amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent) or publicly propose to
withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval,
adoption, recommendation or declaration of advisability of this Agreement or
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B)
recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or
approve, any Alternative Transaction Proposal (any action described in this
clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") (it
being understood that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company
Board to the holders of Common Shares pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or the taking of a neutral or no position with respect
to any Alternative Transaction Proposal shall not constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change) or (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other similar agreement, arrangement or understanding (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 8.4(a)_) (A) constituting
or that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Alternative Transaction
Proposal or (B) requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
that, in the case of this clause (ii), the Company shall not be prohibited
from entering into an agreement if it concurrently terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 10.1(h)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, but subject to the Companys compliance in all material
respects with the other provisions of this  _Section 8.4_, as applicable, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company
Board may (x) make an Adverse Recommendation Change if there exists material
events or changes in circumstance not related to an Alternative Transaction
Proposal that were not known by the Company Board as of the date of this
Agreement and, as a result thereof, the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside counsel and
its independent financial advisor, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the Company under Applicable Law (an " _Intervening Event
Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); _provided_ , that the Company shall
provide Parent with no less than three (3) Business Days advance notice of
any Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation Change (and, if and for so long
as Parent requests, during such three (3) Business Day period the Company and
its legal counsel and independent financial advisor shall negotiate in good
faith with Parent regarding any revisions to the terms of the Merger proposed
by Parent, the purpose of which is to render the Intervening Event Adverse
Recommendation Change unnecessary), or (y) (i) make an Adverse Recommendation
Change related to an Alternative Transaction Proposal if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside
counsel and its independent financial advisor, that such Alternative
Transaction Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior
Proposal (a " _Superior Proposal Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) in
response to a Superior Proposal, resolve to accept such Superior Proposal and
cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(h)_;
_provided_ , that concurrently with such termination, the Company pays the
fees required by _Section 10.3_; _provided_ ,

 



33   _further_ , that (A) no Superior Proposal Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to this _Section 8.4(b)_ may be made and (B) no valid termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(h)_ may be made, unless the Company
Board shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent that it is
prepared to (1) make a Superior Proposal Adverse Recommendation Change or (2)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(h)_ in response to a
Superior Proposal (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ "), which notice shall
(except to the extent prohibited by a confidentiality agreement entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement) contain a description of the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed
that the delivery of such notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be
an Adverse Recommendation Change), and Parent does not make, within three (3)
Business Days after receipt of such notice, a proposal setting forth revised
terms and conditions of this Agreement that would, in the good faith judgment
of the Company Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
its independent financial advisor, cause the offer previously constituting a
Superior Proposal no longer to constitute a Superior Proposal. If Parent has
in good faith made such a proposal to the Company during the three (3)
Business Day period prior to the Company Board making a Superior Proposal
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 8.4(b)_ or the
Company terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(h)_,
the Company agrees that the Company and its outside legal counsel and its
independent financial advisor shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and
its outside legal counsel (so long as Parent and such outside legal counsel
are negotiating in good faith) until the expiration of such three (3)
Business Day period regarding any such revisions to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement set forth in such proposal. Any material changes to the
financial terms or any material change to other material terms of such
Superior Proposal occurring prior to the making of a Superior Proposal Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 8.4(b)_ by the Company Board
or the Company terminating this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 10.1(h)_
shall require the Company to provide to Parent a new Superior Proposal Notice
and a new period of three (3) Business Days.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company or
the Company Board shall be permitted to (i) comply with Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act, including by taking and disclosing to the
shareholders of the Company a position with respect to a tender offer by a
third party and (ii) waive any "standstill" or similar provision in order to
permit a Person to make an Alternative Transaction Proposal, if, in the case
of both clauses (i) and (ii), in the good faith judgment of the Company Board,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and its independent financial
advisor, failure to so comply or waive would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under Applicable Law.

(d) The Company shall advise Parent orally and in writing as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and in all events within one (1) Business Day, after
the receipt thereof of any Alternative Transaction Proposal or request for
information that expressly contemplates or that the Company believes would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of any such Alternative Transaction Proposal
(including any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making any
such Alternative Transaction Proposal or request. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed of the status (including any changes to the
material terms and conditions thereof) of any such Alternative Transaction
Proposal.

 

Section 8.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as
practicable any necessary consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations of,
actions or nonactions by, and make as promptly as practicable all necessary
filings and submissions with, any Governmental Entity or any third party
necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that in no event shall the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or Parent or Merger Sub be required
to pay any fee, penalty or other consideration to obtain any consent,
approval, order, waiver or authorization in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any contract other than _de minimis_
amounts, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to (A) avoid a suit, action,
petition to deny, objection, proceeding or investigation, whether judicial or
administrative and whether brought by a Governmental Entity or any third
party, and (B) avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, stay, temporary restraining order or other order in any such
suit, action, petition to

 



34  deny, objection, proceeding or investigation, in each case, challenging this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or that would otherwise
prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in
(A) determining which filings are required to be made prior to the Effective
Time with, and which material consents, approvals, Permits, notices or
authorizations are required to be obtained prior to the Effective Time from,
Governmental Entities or third parties in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and related agreements and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (B) timely making all such
filings and timely seeking all such consents, approvals, Permits, notices or
authorizations, (iv) use reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to
the Merger set forth in _Article IX_ to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably
practicable and (v) use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all other actions and do, or cause to be done, and cooperate with each other
in order to do, all other things necessary or appropriate to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable. In connection with
the foregoing, the Company, on the one hand, will provide Parent, and Parent,
on the other hand, will provide the Company, with copies of any material
correspondence, filing or communication (or oral summaries or memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between such party or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of
their respective staffs, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby. Prior to submitting or making any
such correspondence, filing or communication to any such Governmental Entity
or members of their respective staffs, the parties shall first provide the
other party with a copy of such correspondence, filing or communication in
draft form and give such other party a reasonable opportunity to discuss its
content before it is submitted or filed with the relevant Governmental
Entities, and shall consider and take account of all reasonable comments
timely made by the other party with respect thereto. To the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, each of the parties shall ensure that the other party is
given the opportunity to attend any meetings with or other appearances before
any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) For purposes of this _Section 8.5_, "reasonable best efforts" shall
include (i) diligently prosecuting the FCC Applications, (ii) vigorously
defending, contesting and objecting to any claims, lawsuits, petitions to
deny, objections, actions or other proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, by or before any Governmental Entity challenging this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or that would otherwise
prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by
any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, (iii) executing
settlements, undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations or other agreements,
(iv) selling, divesting, holding separate or otherwise conveying any
particular assets or categories of assets or businesses of Parent or its
Affiliates other than broadcast stations of the Parent or its Affiliates in
Markets other than the Stations Markets, (v) agreeing to sell, divest, hold
separate or otherwise convey any particular assets or categories of assets or
businesses of the Company or any Company Subsidiary contemporaneously with or
subsequent to the Closing, (vi) permitting the Company to sell, divest, hold
separate or otherwise convey any particular assets or categories of assets or
businesses of the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing,

relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary contemporaneously with or subsequent
to the Closing, (viii) creating any relationships, ventures, contractual
rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent or its Affiliates, (ix)
agreeing to create any relationships, ventures, contractual rights,
obligations or other arrangements of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary contemporaneously with or subsequent to the Closing and (x)
otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing Date
would limit the freedom of action of Parent or its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) with respect to, or its or their ability to retain,
one or more of its or their businesses, product lines or assets; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not be
required to take, and Parent and Merger Sub shall not take, any such actions
contemplated in clauses (i) through (x) above which would bind the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries in respect of any matter if the Closing does not
occur, and (b) notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties
hereto agree and acknowledge that this _Section 8.5(b)_ shall not require, or
be construed to require, any party hereto or their respective Affiliates to
take or agree to take any action or agree or consent to any limitations or
restrictions on freedom of action with

 



35  respect to, or its ability to retain, or make changes in, any such
businesses, assets, licenses, services or operations of Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation (or any of their respective Affiliates) that
individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect ( _provided_ ,
that, for such purposes, "Parent Material Adverse Effect" shall have the same
meaning as Company Material Adverse Effect, disregarding clause (ii) thereof
and substituting Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving
effect to the Merger).

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.5(a)_ and _Section 8.5(b)_
above:

 

(i) Within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, shall file applications with the FCC
seeking the FCC Consent (collectively, the " _FCC Applications_"). The
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the
FCC Consent as promptly as practicable. Parent shall pay the FCC filing fees
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, irrespective of whether the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated. Without limiting
the generality of _Section 7.2_, except as otherwise contemplated by
_Section 8.5(b)_, no party hereto shall take any action that would, or fail
to take any action the failure of which to take would, reasonably be expected
to have the effect of materially delaying the grant of the FCC Consent.

(ii) Within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall make any required filings with the Federal Trade
Commission and the United States Department of Justice pursuant to the HSR
Act, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (including a request
for early termination of the waiting period thereunder), and shall thereafter
promptly respond to all requests received from such agencies for additional
information or documentation. Any filing fees payable under the HSR Act
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by Parent or
Merger Sub, as applicable.

(d) In order to avoid disruption or delay in the processing of the FCC
Applications, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, agree (i) as
part of the FCC Applications, to request that the FCC apply its policy of
permitting the assignment of the FCC Licenses in transactions involving
multiple stations to proceed, notwithstanding the pendency of any application
for the renewal of any FCC License (a " _Renewal Application_ "), and (ii) to
make such representations and undertakings as are necessary or appropriate to
invoke such policy, including undertakings to assume, as between the parties
and the FCC, the position of the applicant before the FCC with respect to any
pending Renewal Application and to assume the corresponding regulatory risks
relating to any such Renewal Application. In addition, Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge that, to the extent reasonably necessary to expedite the grant by
the FCC of any Renewal Application with respect to any Station and thereby to
facilitate the grant of the FCC Consent with respect to such Station, the
Company (or any applicable Company Subsidiary) shall be permitted to enter
into tolling agreements with the FCC to extend the statute of limitations for
the FCC to determine or impose a forfeiture penalty against such Station in
connection with (i) any pending complaints that such Station aired programming
that contained obscene, indecent or profane material or (ii) any other
enforcement matters against such Station with respect to which the FCC
may permit the Company (or any applicable Company Subsidiary) to enter into a
tolling agreement.

(e) If the Closing shall not have occurred for any reason within the original
effective period of the FCC Consent, and neither party shall have terminated
this Agreement under _Section 10.1_, Parent and the Company shall jointly
request an extension of the effective period of the FCC Consent. No extension
of the FCC Consent shall limit the right of either party to exercise its
rights under _Section 10.1_.

Section 8.6 _Public Announcements; Public Disclosures_. Parent and the Company
will consult with each other before issuing any press release or making any
public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except for any press release or public statement as
may be required by Applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, will not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the prior written
consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed,
conditioned or withheld); _provided_ , that the Company shall be permitted
(without consulting with, or obtaining the consent of, Parent) to make such
statements and

 



36  announcements to its employees as the Company shall deem to be reasonably
necessary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) nothing in this _Section 8.6_
shall limit the Companys or the Company Boards rights under _Section 8.4_,
(b) the Company will no longer be required to consult with Parent in
connection with any such press release or public statement if the Company
Board has effected any Adverse Recommendation Change or shall have resolved
to do so and (c) the requirements of this _Section 8.6_ shall not apply to
any disclosure by the Company or Parent of any information concerning this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in connection with any
dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 8.7 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Until the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Effective Time (the "
_Benefits Continuation Period_ "), and subject to the last sentence of this
_Section 8.7_, Parent shall provide, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries to provide, for those employees
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (excluding any employees
represented by labor unions and/or covered by collective bargaining
agreements) who continue as employees of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries during the Benefits Continuation Period
(the " _Company Employees_ "), (i) a base salary or hourly wage rate that is
no less favorable than that provided to such Company Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) a cash incentive opportunity (including
bonuses and/or commissions) that is no less favorable than that provided to
such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii)
employee benefits (including welfare plan benefits for spouses and dependents,
as applicable, but excluding any equity based compensation and defined benefit
pension plan) that either, at the option of Parent, are (A) no less favorable
in the aggregate than those provided to such Company Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time or (B) no less favorable in the aggregate than
those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for the
Benefits Continuation Period, Parent shall honor, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to honor the severance,
retention and any similar benefits and any Company Benefit Plan set forth on
_Section 8.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter provided to a Company
Employee under an applicable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including by recognizing all service recognized for such
purposes under the applicable Company Benefit Plan (unless otherwise agreed to
in writing by the affected Company Employee).

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit
accrual and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant under
any benefit plan or arrangement of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee
after the Effective Time (collectively, the " _New Plans_ "), the Company
Employees shall receive service credit for service with the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (and any respective predecessors) to the same extent such
service credit was granted under the Company Benefit Plans, including with
respect to vacation time, sick time and recognized holidays, except
for benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent
any such service credit would result in the duplication of benefits. In
addition and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each
Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time or satisfaction of any other eligibility requirements, in any and
all New Plans and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent
shall cause (x) all pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-
at-work requirements and waiting periods under such New Plan to be waived for
such employee and his or her covered dependents, except to the extent that
such pre-existing condition limitation, exclusions, actively-at work
requirements and waiting periods would have been applicable under the
comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (y) any expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year ending on the date such
employees participation in the New Plan begins to be taken into account under
such New Plan for the purpose of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance,
maximum out-of-pocket requirements and similar expenses applicable to such
employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



37 (c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.7(a)_, from and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, honor in accordance with their terms each Company Benefit Plan that
continues to be in effect and operate and administer such Company Benefit Plan
in good faith and accordance with its terms.

(d) For those employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
represented by labor unions and/or covered by collective bargaining
agreements who continue as employees of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries to, honor in
accordance with their terms each applicable collective bargaining agreement in
good faith. The Company shall take or cause to be taken such actions as are
required pursuant to the terms of any applicable collective bargaining
agreement covering employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and the parties hereto
shall cooperate between the date hereof and the Closing Date to facilitate the
assumption, as applicable, of the obligations under such collective
bargaining agreements by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries.

(e) Nothing in this _Section 8.7_ shall confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities upon any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 8.8 _Company Indemnification Provisions_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee or agent may have under any employment or indemnification
agreement or under the Companys Constituent Documents, this Agreement or, if
applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of any of the
Company Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who
was, is at the date of this Agreement or becomes during the period from the
date of this Agreement through the Closing Date (A) a director or officer of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, (B) a director, officer or
trustee of another entity (but only to the extent that such person is or was
serving in such capacity at the request of the Company) or (C) an employee or
agent of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), in each case, to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by Applicable Law without regard to whether indemnification may be
available to such Indemnified Party from another Person, as now or hereafter
in effect, in connection with any Claim and any judgments, fines, penalties
and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other
charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such judgments,
fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) resulting therefrom and (ii)
promptly pay on behalf of or, within ten (10) Business Days after any request
for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest
extent authorized or permitted by Applicable Law, as now or hereafter in
effect, any expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect
to or otherwise participating in any Claim in advance of the final disposition
of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the
Indemnified Party of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification or
advancement, in each case, without the requirement of any bond or other
security. The indemnification and advancement obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation pursuant to this _Section 8.8(a)_ shall extend to acts
or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim relating
thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
consideration, approval and adoption thereof and the process undertaken in
connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto), and all rights to
indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to a
person who continues to be or who has ceased to be (A) a director or officer
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (B) a director, officer or trustee
of another entity (but only to the extent that such person is or was serving
in such capacity at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary) or
(C) an employee or agent of the Company or any Company Subsidiary after the
date of this Agreement, and shall inure to the benefit of such persons heirs,
executors and personal and legal representatives. Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any Claim in respect of which indemnification has been or could be
sought by such Indemnified

 



38  Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Claim and does not include an admission of fault or wrongdoing by any
Indemnified Party, or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.
Parent shall cause the Constituent Documents of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and limitation of director, officer and employee
liability that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties than those set
forth in the Constituent Documents of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, which provisions thereafter
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Parties. From and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume, be jointly and severally
liable for, and honor, guarantee and stand surety for, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their
respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this  _Section 8.8_.

(b) The Company may obtain, prior to the Effective Time, a single payment,
run-off policy or policies of directors and officers, employed lawyers and
fiduciary liability insurance covering the Persons currently covered by the
Companys existing directors and officers, employed lawyers
and/or fiduciary liability insurance policies for claims arising in respect
of actual or alleged errors, misstatements, acts, omissions or any matter
claimed against any such Person occurring prior to the Effective Time (but
only in respect thereof) in amount and scope no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than the Companys existing policies, from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance
carrier with respect to such insurance, such policy or policies to become
effective at the Effective Time and remain in effect for a period of six (6)
years following the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the premium
for such run-off policy or policies shall not exceed three hundred percent
(300%) of the aggregate annual amounts currently paid by the Company to
maintain its existing directors and officers, employed lawyers and
fiduciary liability insurance policies. If such run-off policy or policies
shall have been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause such policy or policies to be maintained in full force and effect,
for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by
the Surviving Corporation. If the Company for any reason fails to obtain such
run-off policy or policies as of the Effective Time, Parent shall obtain, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, such run-off policy or policies;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the premium for such run-off policy or
policies shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual
amounts currently paid by the Company to maintain its existing directors and
officers, employed lawyers and fiduciary liability insurance policies
(which aggregate premiums with respect to calendar year 2012 are hereby
represented and warranted by the Company to be the amount set forth on
_Section 8.8(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that, if such run-off policy or policies cannot be obtained or can be obtained
only by paying aggregate premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of
such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
only be required to obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by paying a
premium equal to three hundred percent (300%) of such amount.

 

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its or their successors or
assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or other entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 8.8_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 8.8_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs
and their respective representatives. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, this _Section 8.8_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and
severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and their respective Subsidiaries. Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses,
including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 8.8_.

Section 8.9 _Merger Sub_. Parent will take all actions necessary to (a) cause
Merger Sub to comply with this Agreement, perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger, in each case, on the 

 



39  terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) ensure that, prior
to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct any business or make any
investments, other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, or
incur or guarantee any indebtedness or liabilities.

Section 8.10  _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "business
combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute
or regulation is or may become applicable to the Merger, the parties shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) take such actions as are
reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereunder may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
(b) otherwise take all such actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate
or minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the Merger.

 

Section 8.11 _No Control of the Company s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or any Company
Subsidiarys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and the Company
Subsidiaries operations.

 

Section 8.12 _Additional Matters_. In case, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, take all such necessary action.

Section 8.13 _Section 16_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition of any equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) pursuant to this Agreement by any officer or director of the
Company who is a covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of
the Exchange Act (" _Section 16_ ") shall be an exempt transaction for
purposes of Section 16\.

Section 8.14 _Transfer Taxes_. All stock transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including interest,
penalties and additions to any such Taxes) incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger (other than
such Taxes required to be paid by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the holder of record of the Common
Shares with respect to which such payment is made), shall be borne and paid by
either Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation (regardless of the Person
liable for such Taxes under Applicable Law).

 

Section 8.15 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any shareholder
litigation against the Company or its directors arising after the date of this
Agreement as a result of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, and with respect to any settlement in connection therewith, no such
settlement shall occur without Parents prior written consent, except as
otherwise permitted under _Section 7.1(j)_. It is understood and agreed that
this _Section 8.15_ shall not give Parent the right to direct any such
defense.

Section 11.3 _Interpretation_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. Consequently, in the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall
be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption
or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. The headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The specification of
any dollar amount in any representation or warranty contained in _Article V_
or _Article VI_ is not intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower
amounts, are or are not material for purposes of this Agreement, and no party
shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount in any dispute or
controversy between or among the parties as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described herein or included in the Company Disclosure Letter or
the Parent Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. Whenever this Agreement requires a Company Subsidiary to take any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part
of the Company to cause such Company Subsidiary to take such action and,
after the Effective Time, on the part of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires
Merger Sub to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such action.

Section 11.4 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (including the
Exhibits, Schedules and other documents and instruments referred to herein)
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings (other than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement,
which is hereby incorporated by reference herein), both written and oral,
among the parties or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof,
including any transaction between or among the parties. This Agreement shall
not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise.

Section 11.5 _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) This Agreement shall be deemed to be made in and in all respects shall be
interpreted, construed and governed by and in accordance with the laws of the
State of Washington without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof.

(b) Except as set out below, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (i) consents to submit to the sole and
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York or any court of
the United States located in the County of New York in the State of New York
(the " _New York Courts_") for any litigation arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence
any litigation relating thereto except in such courts), (ii) waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the New
York Courts and (iii) agrees not to plead or claim in any New York Court that
such litigation brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum.
Each of the parties hereto agrees that (i) to the extent such party is not
otherwise subject to service of process in the State of New York, to appoint
and maintain an agent in the State of Washington as such partys agent for
acceptance of legal process and (ii) service of process may also be made on
such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt
validated by

 



45  the United States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid service.
Service made pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding
sentence shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such
party personally within the State of New York.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 11.5_.

 

Section 11.6 _Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth herein (including
_Section 8.5_, _Section 10.2_ and  _Section 10.3_), whether or not the
Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses.

 

Section 11.7 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

Section 11.8 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties, in the case of Parent, of
the Company and, in the case of the Company, of Parent or Merger Sub, in each
case, contained herein (or in any document delivered pursuant hereto) and (c)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions , in the case of
Parent, of the Company and, in the case of the Company, of Parent or Merger
Sub, in each case, contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. No failure or delay by
any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall act as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power
or privilege hereunder.

Section 11.9 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but
all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement
shall become effective when each party shall have received counterparts
thereof signed and delivered (by facsimile, e-mail of a .pdf attachment or
otherwise) by all of the other parties.

Section 11.10 _Severability; Validity; Parties in Interest_. If any provision
of this Agreement or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any rule of law or public policy,
the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to
other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby, and, to such
end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. Except
(a) as provided in _Section 8.8_, (b) following the Effective Time, for the
provisions of _Article IV_ and (c) for the right of the Company, on behalf
of its shareholders, to pursue damages in the event of Parents or Merger
Subs breach of this Agreement or fraud, which right is hereby acknowledged

 



46  and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Person not a party to this Agreement
any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

Section 11.11 _Enforcement of Agreement_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached or
the Merger was not consummated, and that money damages would not be an
adequate remedy, even if available. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
(on behalf of themselves and the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement
provided in _Section 11.10_) shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific performance or
equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties
obligations to consummate the Merger and Parents obligation to pay, and the
right of the shareholders of the Company to receive, the Merger Consideration)
in any court of competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has
an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.
