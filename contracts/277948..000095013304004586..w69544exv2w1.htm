Benefit, if any, resulting from the Tax consequences of the Indemnifiable Cost.

uncertainties, that Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all projections and other forecasts
and plans so furnished to it, and that Purchaser shall have no claim against
anyone with respect thereto. Accordingly, Purchaser acknowledges that Seller
makes no representation or warranty with respect to such projections, forecasts

the other parties and to obtain such parties&#146; consent but has been unable to do
so in a timely manner. Nothing in this Section&nbsp;11.5 shall interfere with

shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as

arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined in
any New York state or Federal court sitting in the City of New York, and the
parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts
in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. To the
extent that any party has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from

irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its obligations with respect to
this Agreement. Each party irrevocably consents to the service of any and all
process in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies of such
process to such party at its address specified in Section&nbsp;11.4. The parties
agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment

affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by law. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this Section&nbsp;11.13
shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of New
York and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this
Section&nbsp;11.13 and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than
the parties. Each party hereto irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert,

Purchaser and Seller hereby irrevocably agrees not to claim and irrevocably

which a Indemnified Party would be

non-performance thereof or non-compliance therewith under the Residual

agreement under which such CSX Covenant arises (although any failure to list
any CSX Covenant or CSX Obligation required to be so listed will constitute
only a breach of this representation and warranty and shall not relieve the

compliance by a Indemnified Party or its respective successors or assigns under
any agreement or instrument which is the subject of a Residual Liability (each
such agreement or instrument, a &#147;CSX Obligation&#148;).

to fulfill its obligations under the
Indemnitor Covenant with respect to any CSX Covenant, or elects not to cure or
prevent the occurrence of a breach under the relevant CSX Obligation as
contemplated by Section 20(m) hereof, the Indemnified Party may, but is not
obligated to, fulfill any such CSX Covenant. Unless the Indemnified Party&#146;s
failure to do so could subject the Indemnified Party to criminal liability,
significant consequential damages or a material adverse effect to its business
or condition, the Indemnified Party agrees that it will not so fulfill any such
CSX Covenant if and to the extent that the Indemnitor shall have delivered to
the Beneficiary a writing stating that the Indemnitor disputes in good faith
that payment or performance of such CSX Covenant is due but clearly and
unconditionally acknowledging liability therefor hereunder in the event that
payment or performance is in fact due. Any amounts so paid and all costs and
expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of outside counsel and
outside accountants and other reasonably necessary professional experts)
incurred by the Indemnified Party in fulfilling any CSX Covenant or otherwise
in enforcing or preserving any of its rights under the Indemnitor Covenant and

the Purchaser and the Beneficiary and each of their present and future

indemnified being referred to herein as an &#147;Indemnified Party&#148;) from and
against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, charges, actions,
judgments, suits, proceedings, governmental investigations, deficiencies,

necessary processional experts) (collectively, the &#147;Losses&#148;) imposed upon or
incurred by an Indemnified Party resulting from or arising directly or
indirectly out of the Residual Liabilities, the Residual Assets and the CSX
Obligations (the &#147;Indemnity&#148;).

covered by the Indemnity is brought
against an Indemnified Party (an &#147;Indemnified Claim&#148;), such Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnitor or the Guarantor written notice of such
Indemnified Claim (a &#147;Claim Notice&#148;) within 10&nbsp;days after receipt by such
Indemnified Party of notice of the Indemnified Claim; provided, however, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, that failure to give such
Claim Notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except if

materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

receipt of a Claim Notice and after
consultation with the Beneficiary, shall determine whether such Indemnified

Indemnified Claim is determined to be a Post-Closing Date CSX Dispute, the
Indemnitor or the Guarantor shall assume the defense thereof in accordance with
the procedures set forth in Section&nbsp;10 of this Agreement.

consultation with the Beneficiary, determines
that an Indemnified Claim is not a CSX Dispute, the Indemnitor shall so notify

to
participate in the defense of such Indemnified Claim and, if it so chooses, to
assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnitor and
reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Party; provided, that the Indemnitor
acknowledges to the Indemnified Party its right to indemnity pursuant hereto in
respect of the entirety of such claim (as such claim may have been modified
through written agreement of the parties hereunder). Should the Indemnitor so
elect to assume the defense of an Indemnified Claim, the Indemnitor shall not
be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by
the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, but shall
continue to pay for any Losses suffered to the extent provided under the
Indemnity. If the Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall

its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitor.

mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation or
testimony for any material provided hereunder or with respect to relevant facts
as set forth in Sections&nbsp;12 and 13 of this Agreement, in each case, at the
expense of the Indemnitor or the Guarantor.

which criminal conduct is alleged) without the Indemnified Party&#146;s consent if
such settlement, compromise or discharge (i)&nbsp;constitutes a complete and
unconditional discharge and release of all Indemnified Parties and (ii)
provides for no obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party other than the
payment of monetary damages and such monetary damages are paid in full by the
Indemnitor or the Guarantor, and in all other cases may not so settle without

Indemnifiable Cost by the Indemnified Party and (ii)&nbsp;the indemnity payment
required to made by the Indemnitor shall be increased by the amount of any Tax
Cost borne by the Indemnified Party with respect to such payment (or with
respect to any increase in an indemnity payment as a result of this clause
(ii)). The Tax Benefit reimbursement shall be made when actually realized by
the Indemnified Party, whether such realization occurs in the year the
indemnification payment is made or in a later year via a loss carryforward,
foreign tax credit carryforward or otherwise. &#147;Tax Benefit&#148; shall mean the
excess, if any, of (i)&nbsp;Taxes that would have been incurred by the Indemnified
Party for the year at issue if the Indemnifiable Cost had not been incurred by
the Indemnified Party, over (ii)&nbsp;the actual Taxes payable by the Indemnified

pursuant to this Agreement and actually paid by the Indemnified Party in the

used to offset any such Tax, as determined by the Indemnified Party in good
faith. In years subsequent to the year the Tax Benefit is realized, the
Indemnitor shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for the Reduced Tax Benefit,
if any, resulting from the Tax consequences of the Indemnifiable Cost.
&#147;Reduced Tax Benefit&#148; shall mean the difference, if any, between the Taxes
actually incurred by the Indemnified Party in the subsequent year at issue and
the Taxes that the Indemnified Party would have incurred had the Indemnifiable
Cost not been incurred by the Indemnified Party.
