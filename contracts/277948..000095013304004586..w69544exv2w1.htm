Each Employee Benefit Plan maintained outside the United States primarily for the benefit of Employees working outside the United States shall be referred to herein as a "Non-U.S. Benefit Plan," and the terms "Employee Benefit Plan" and "Employee Benefit Plans" shall exclude the Non-U.S. Benefit Plans in all sections of this Agreement other than this Section 3.13(b). Schedule 3.13(b) specifies which material Employee Benefit Plans are (i) sponsored, maintained or contributed to solely by one or more members of the Company / Subsidiary Group but are not Non-U.S. Benefit Plans (such plans, the " _Company / Subsidiary Group Plans_ "), (ii) sponsored or maintained by Seller (the " _Seller Plans_ "), (iii) multiemployer plans as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA (the " _Multiemployer Plans_ ") and (iv) Non-U.S. Benefit Plans.   

 (c) With respect to each Seller Plan, Seller has heretofore made available to Purchaser true and complete copies of the governing plan documents, including, but not limited to, any trust instruments, insurance contracts and with respect to any employee stock ownership plan, loan agreements forming any part of any Seller Plan (including all amendments thereto), and with respect to each of the Company / Subsidiary Group Plans (and not the Multiemployer Plans), Seller has heretofore made available to Purchaser true and complete copies of (i) the governing plan documents (including all amendments thereto), (ii) the most recent ERISA summary plan description, if any, (iii) the most recent annual report, actuarial report, and financial statements, if any, required under ERISA, and (iv) the most recent determination letter received from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ "), if any.   

 (d) All Employee Benefit Plans (other than Multiemployer Plans) comply in all material respects with ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws. Each Employee Benefit Plan (other than each Multiemployer Plan) which is subject to ERISA (an " _ERISA Plan_ ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " _Pension Plan_ ") intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS covering all tax law changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has applied to the IRS for such favorable determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code, and neither Seller nor the Company    ##### 

  

    

is aware of any circumstances likely to result in the revocation of such
letter. To Sellers Knowledge, no member of the Company / Subsidiary Group
has engaged in a transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan that, assuming
the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, could
reasonably be expected to subject any member of the Company /
Subsidiary Group to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be material. No
member of the Company / Subsidiary Group has incurred or reasonably expects
to incur a material tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980 of the Code or
Section 502 of ERISA or any material liability under Section 4071 of
ERISA.   

 (e) As of the date hereof, there are no Actions pending or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened (other than routine claims for benefits), against any Company / Subsidiary Group Plan, or against any member of the Company / Subsidiary Group with respect to any Company / Subsidiary Group Plan that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any Company / Subsidiary Group Plan.   

 (f) Except as would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) no liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by any member of the Company / Subsidiary Group with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one employer with the Company / Subsidiary Group under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ") that has not been, or will not prior to the Closing Date be, satisfied in full, and (ii) no condition exists that presents a risk to any member of the Company / Subsidiary Group of incurring a liability under such Subtitles.

purposes of this Section 5.3, (i) the "commercially reasonable efforts" of
Purchaser shall include Purchasers agreement to hold separate and divest any
assets of the Company, the Subsidiaries or the Joint Ventures (the "
_Purchased Business_ ") or any subsidiary or Affiliate of Purchaser, if any,
engaged in the international shipping, container or port terminal business
(the " _Purchaser Business_ ") or any portion of the Purchased Business or
the Purchaser Business, in each case that would not constitute a material
portion of the assets and businesses of the Purchased Business and the
Purchaser Business, taken as a whole, immediately following the Closing, and
(ii) the "commercially reasonable efforts" of Seller shall
not require Seller to incur any additional obligation or expense, pay
any consideration or resort to litigation.   

 (b) Seller shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to give such notices to third parties (other than Governmental Authorities) and use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents of all Persons as are necessary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Seller in giving such notices and obtaining all such consents. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the term "commercially reasonable efforts" shall not be deemed to require Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary to be required to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any obligation in favor of) any Person from whom any such consent may be required.   

 (c) On the Closing Date, Seller, the Company, CSX Residual Company and Purchaser shall amend and restate the Payment and Indemnity Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_, which shall not be otherwise terminated, amended or modified in any way prior to Closing without Purchasers written approval.

event, circumstance or fact arising subsequent to the date of this Agreement
which could reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any
representation or warranty or covenant of such party in this Agreement, give
notice thereof to the other party and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to prevent or to remedy promptly such breach; provided, however, that
the delivery of, or failure to deliver, any notice pursuant to this Section
5.4 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder.   

 SECTION 5.5 _Insurance; Risk of Loss_.   

 (a) Seller shall keep, or cause to be kept, all insurance policies set forth on Schedule 3.17, or suitable replacements therefor, in full force and effect through the close of business on the Closing Date.

Promptly following the date hereof, Seller shall designate an individual to use his or her best efforts to obtain and deliver to Purchaser copies of each of the insurance policies set forth in Schedule 3.17 at the earliest time practicable but in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, effective as of the Closing Date, Seller will terminate or cause its Affiliates (other than the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures) to terminate all coverage relating to the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures and their respective businesses, assets and Employees under the general corporate policies of insurance, cancelable surety bonds and hold harmless agreements of Seller for the benefit of the Company, any Subsidiary or any Joint Venture; provided, however, that (i) no such termination of any occurrence policy in force as of the Closing Date shall be effected so as to prevent the Company from recovering under such policies for losses from events occurring prior to the Closing Date to the extent a member of Sellers risk management department shall have received written notice of claims relating to such events on or before the ninetieth (90th) day following the Closing Date, it being understood that the Company shall be responsible for any deductible payable under the terms of the applicable policy in connection with any such claims; (ii) no such termination of any claims made policy in force as of the Closing Date shall be effected so as to prevent the Company from recovering under such policies for losses from events occurring prior to the Closing Date to the extent a member of Sellers risk management department shall have received written notice of claims relating to such events before the Closing Date; and (iii) Purchaser shall become solely responsible for all insurance coverage and related risk of loss with respect to the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures and their respective businesses and assets and Employees based on (x) events occurring on or after the Closing Date and (y) events occurring prior to the Closing Date for which notice has not been received as described by the date set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii). Seller shall notify each applicable insurance company for any claims made prior to the Closing Date.    ##### 

  

  

 (b) To the extent that, after the Closing Date, Seller or the Company requires any information regarding claim data, payroll or other information in order to make filings with insurance carriers, Seller shall promptly supply such information to the Company, or Purchaser shall cause the Company or any applicable Subsidiary or Joint Venture promptly to supply such information to Seller, as the case may be.   

 (c) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Company to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director or officer of the Company, any Subsidiary or any Joint Venture to the same extent such Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement against any and all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Actions, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring during the period prior to and including the Closing Date (and Purchaser shall also cause the Company to advance expenses as incurred to the same extent the Company is required to advance such expenses as of the date of this Agreement).   

 SECTION 5.6 _Company Names; Trademarks, Brand Names, Etc_.   

 (a) Purchaser shall prepare and promptly following the Closing take all necessary actions to file or cause to be filed with the appropriate Governmental Authorities on the Closing Date or as promptly thereafter as practicable, amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and to the Certificate of Incorporation or comparable constitutive documents of each Subsidiary and Joint Venture that has a corporate name which contains the name "CSX", "CSXWT", "CSX World Terminals", "CSX World" or similar name, in each case to change the name of such entity to a name designated by Purchaser that bears no association with Seller or any of its Affiliates (it being understood and agreed that no such name designated by Purchaser shall be or include the words "CSX" , "CSXWT", CSX World Terminals" or "CSX World" or any combinations thereof); provided, however, that no filing shall be required to be made to amend the Articles of Association of CSX World Terminals Yantai Co., Ltd. if the written approval of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China shall not have been obtained in advance. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such filings to be approved but shall have no liability for breach of contract, royalty payments or otherwise if, after the exercise of such commercially reasonable efforts, such filings are not approved; provided, that if any such filings are not approved, Purchaser shall have no rights with respect to each such relevant Mark, except to the limited extent expressly provided in this Section 5.6(a) or in Section 5.6(b) below.   

 (b) On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assign to Seller all right, title and interest in and to all trademarks, service marks, trade names, brandmarks, brand names, domain names, trade dress and logos, whether registered or unregistered, that contain the names "CSX," "CSXWT," "CSX World Terminals," "W" and any similar names (collectively, the " _Marks_ ") and all goodwill associated therewith. Purchaser shall sign all assignments and other documents requested by Seller in connection with such assignment, and shall otherwise assist and cooperate with Seller and take such further actions as may be necessary in order to effectuate such assignment. As promptly as    ##### 

  

    

commercially reasonably practical after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
cause the Company and the Subsidiaries, and use its commercially reasonably
efforts to cause the Joint Ventures, to remove or cover the Marks from all
terminal and other facilities, equipment, machinery, signs, billboards,
advertising materials, telephone listings, Internet sites, labels,
stationery, office forms or packaging of the Company, the Subsidiaries and
the Joint Ventures. Thereafter, Purchaser shall neither use nor permit the
Company, any Subsidiary or any Joint Venture to use such Marks in connection
with the businesses of the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures
or otherwise, except in connection with (i) historical references to the
Company, any Subsidiary or any Joint Ventures, (ii) tax, accounting and other
records or (iii) other factual references which are not reasonably likely to
confuse customers or any other Person regarding the origin of goods and
services supplied by the Company, any Subsidiary or any Joint Venture. For
avoidance of doubt, historical references shall include the ability to
represent that the Company, any Subsidiary or any Joint Venture conducted any
business or achieved any technical or commercial successes that it in fact
did conduct or achieve. Seller and Purchaser agree that the Marks are a
valuable asset of Seller and its Affiliates that has a special, unique and
extraordinary character, and any misuse of the Marks in violation of
this Agreement may cause Seller and its Affiliates irreparable harm for which
it would have no adequate remedy at law; therefore, Seller shall be entitled
to seek injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent any misuse or
threatened misuse of the Marks.   

 SECTION 5.7 _Intercompany Accounts and Agreements_.   

 (a) Seller and Purchaser each acknowledge and agree that, to the extent possible under applicable Law, contract and fiduciary duties, no intercompany payables, receivables, loans, notes, debts, advances, and current and deferred income tax liabilities and assets of the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures to or from Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures) (collectively, " _Intercompany Accounts_ "), other than any under the Payment and Indemnity Agreement, shall exist or be outstanding as of the Closing Date. Seller shall cause the Company, each Subsidiary and each Joint Venture, on the one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures) on the other, to settle immediately prior to the Closing all outstanding Intercompany Accounts.

 (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.7(b) and in Section 5.10 below, Seller and Purchaser each acknowledge and agree that Seller shall cause all agreements between or among Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures), on the one hand, and any of the Company, any Subsidiary or any Joint Venture, on the other hand, to be terminated with no further Liabilities on the part of any party thereto.

Company or any Subsidiary who were appointed by Seller or the Company and
whose principal employment is not as an employee of such entity.   

 SECTION 5.9 _Books and Records_.   

 (a) After the Closing, upon reasonable prior written notice, Purchaser and Seller shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and their employees, counsel, auditors and representatives access, during normal business hours, to such information and assistance relating to the Company and the Subsidiaries as is reasonably necessary for financial reporting and accounting matters, the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns or the defense of any Tax audit, claim or assessment. Each party shall reimburse the other for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in assisting the other pursuant to this Section 5.9(a). Neither party shall be required by this Section 5.9(a) to take any action that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business or unreasonably disrupt its normal operations or result in any actual or potential breach of the Law or give rise to any other actual or potential compliance concern (or, in the case of Purchaser, the business or operations of the Company or the Subsidiaries).   

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser, at the location set forth under Section 11.4(b) or such other location as the Seller and Purchaser may agree, all agreements, documents, books, records and files, including records and files stored on computer disks or tapes or any other storage medium (collectively, "Records") in the possession of Seller relating to the business and operations of the Company, the Subsidiaries or the Joint Ventures; provided, however, that   

 (i) Purchaser recognizes that certain Records may relate primarily to Seller or to subsidiaries or divisions of Seller other than the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures and that Seller may retain such Records and shall provide copies of the relevant portions thereof to Purchaser;   

 (ii) Seller may retain all Records prepared in connection with the sale of the Shares, including bids received from other parties and analyses relating to the Company, the Subsidiaries or the Joint Ventures; and   

 (iii) Seller may retain any Tax Returns and Records, and Purchaser shall be provided with true and complete copies of such Tax Returns and Records, including schedules of various tax attributes (including net operating losses, earnings and profits, Taxes paid, depreciation, tax bases and other similar relevant information), but only to the extent that such Tax Returns and Records are separate Tax Returns (including pro forma Tax Returns) or Records of any of the Company, the Subsidiaries or the Joint Ventures, or otherwise relate to the separate Tax liability, of any of the Company, the Subsidiaries or the Joint Ventures.

the Subsidiaries, it being understood that (x) Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to terminate its use of the Services as soon

 SECTION 5.11 _Confidentiality._    

 Purchaser acknowledges that the information provided or to be provided to it, its affiliates or representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.

liability to Seller and its Affiliates any necessary funding to the
Company, the Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures in advance of the exercise
of taking any action; and provided further that no provision of this Section
5.12 shall require the Company, any Subsidiary or any Joint Venture to take
any action, or refrain from taking any action, that would (1) result in a
violation of fiduciary duties to the holders of the capital stock or other
equity interests, (2) violate applicable constitutive documents, (3) violate

its obligations under the provision of this Section 5.12(b).   

 SECTION 5.13 _No Solicitation_.   

 Seller shall not directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiries or proposals from, discuss or negotiate with, provide any non-public information to, or consider the merits of any unsolicited inquiries or proposals from, any Person (other than Purchaser) relating to any transaction involving the transfer of the control or business of the Company, any Subsidiary or any Joint Venture to any other party.

 From the date hereof to the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts at Purchasers cost and expense to take such actions as specifically directed by Purchaser with respect to the matters set forth on Schedule 5.16; provided, however, that no provision of this Section 5.16 shall require the Company, any Subsidiary or any Joint Venture to take any action, or refrain from taking any action, that would (i) except as set forth on Schedule 5.16, result in any direct or indirect cost (Tax-related or otherwise), liability (contingent     #####

Purchaser hereby represents and covenants that it shall not permit the Company or any of the Subsidiaries to dispose of any asset on the Closing Date or to take any other action on the Closing Date that would generate taxable income resulting in Tax for which Seller is required to indemnify under Section 9.3, other than dispositions of assets and other actions in the ordinary course and customary for the business of the Company or any such Subsidiary, as the case may be. Purchaser agrees that if it shall permit the Company or any of the Subsidiaries to make any disposition or take any other action contrary to the representation and covenant contained in the immediately preceding sentence that would otherwise result in the affiliated group (within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code) of which Seller is a member having to include income or gain in its United States federal income tax return for a taxable period that includes the Closing Date, Purchaser shall report such income or gain in its federal consolidated income tax return under the "next day rule" of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B). The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, and the principle thereof, shall also apply with respect to any state and local income tax purposes of any affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or any of the Subsidiaries) is a member.

All consents, approvals, authorizations or other orders of or by any Governmental Authority or other Person to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been obtained and be in effect as of the Closing Date without imposing any liability or conditions on Seller or its Affiliates, except where the failure to obtain such consent, approval, authorization or other order either individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of Seller or Sellers ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.   

 (d) _No Order_. There shall not be in effect any Law or Governmental Order directing that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not be consummated or which has the effect of rendering it unlawful to consummate such transactions; provided that Seller shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to have any such Governmental Order vacated or lifted.    #####

The covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement to be complied with by Seller at or before the Closing shall have been complied with in all material respects. Purchaser shall have received a certificate from Seller signed by an executive officer thereof with respect to the matters described in this Section 8.2(a).

All consents, approvals, authorizations or other orders of or by any Governmental Authority or other Person to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been obtained and be in effect as of the Closing Date, except where the failure to obtain such consent, approval, authorization or other order would not reasonably be expected to have a Closing Material Adverse Effect.   

 (d) _No Order_. There shall not be in effect any Law or Governmental Order directing that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not be consummated or which has the effect of rendering it unlawful to consummate such transactions; provided that Purchaser shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to have any such Governmental Order vacated or lifted.

 SECTION 8.3 _Effect of Certain Waivers of Closing Conditions_. If prior to the Closing any party (the " _waiving party_ ") has Knowledge of any breach by any other party of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto and the waiving party has not provided written notice of such breach to the other parties prior to the Closing and proceeds with the Closing, then the waiving party shall be deemed to have waived such breach and the waiving party and its successors, assigns and Affiliates shall not be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to Article IX, to sue for damages or to assert any other right or remedy for any losses arising from any matters relating to such condition or breach, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto.   

ARTICLE IX   

INDEMNIFICATION   

 SECTION 9.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall expire on the date that is two (2) years after the Closing Date; provided, however, that the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.5 shall survive indefinitely and the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.16 shall survive the Closing until ninety (90) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof). Neither the period of survival nor the liability of Seller with respect to Sellers representations and warranties shall be reduced by any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of Purchaser, and neither the period of survival nor the liability of Purchaser with respect to Purchasers representations and warranties shall be reduced by any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of Seller. If written notice of a claim has been given in accordance with Section 9.2(c) prior to the expiration of the applicable representations and warranties, then the relevant representations and warranties shall survive as to such claim, until such claim has been finally resolved.   

 SECTION 9.2 _Indemnification other than for Tax Matters_.   

 (a) Purchaser and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns shall be indemnified and held harmless by Seller for any and all Liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs and expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) actually suffered or incurred by them (hereinafter a " _Loss_ "), arising out of or resulting from:   

 (i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement other than in Section 3.16; or   

 (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement by Seller contained in this Agreement other than in Article VII.    ##### 

  

  

 The foregoing provisions of this Section 9.2(a) shall not apply with respect to any Losses suffered by any Indemnified Party (x) arising out of (and no indemnification hereunder shall be available with respect to) any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller that is terminated as provided in Section 9.1 or (y) that would not have resulted but for the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Indemnified Party.   

 (b) Seller and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns shall be indemnified and held harmless by Purchaser for any and all Losses arising out of or resulting from:   

 (i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in this Agreement;   

 (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement by Purchaser contained in this Agreement; or   

 (iii) the matters set forth in Schedule 9.2(b).   

 The foregoing provisions of Section 9.2(b)(i) and (ii) shall not apply with respect to any Losses suffered by any Indemnified Party (x) arising out of (and no indemnification hereunder shall be available with respect to) any breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser that is terminated as provided in Section 9.1 or (y) that would not have resulted but for the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party.   

 (c) Any party seeking indemnification under this Section 9.2 (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give the party from whom indemnification is being sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") notice of any matter which such Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement, within ten (10) days of such determination, stating the amount of the Loss, if known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises. The obligations and Liabilities of an Indemnifying Party under this Section 9.2 with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party which are subject to the indemnification provided for in this Section 9.2 ("Third Party Claims") shall be governed by and contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions: if an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third Party Claim within ten (10) days of the receipt by the Indemnified Party of such notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Section 9.2 except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of any such Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days of the receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment    ##### 

  

  

of the Indemnified Party for the same counsel to represent both
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to retain its own counsel, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, provided that in any case the Indemnifying Party shall
not be obligated to pay the expenses of more than one separate counsel for
all Indemnified Parties, taken together. In the event the Indemnifying Party
exercises the right to undertake any such defense against any such Third
Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying
Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party.
Similarly, in the event the Indemnified Party is conducting the defense
against any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate
with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the
Indemnified Party all such witnesses, records, materials and information in
the Indemnifying Partys possession or under the Indemnifying Partys control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, (i) settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof
the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of
a written release from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim or
(ii) settle or compromise any Third Party Claim in any manner that may
materially adversely affect the Indemnified Party other than as a result of
money damages or other monetary payments. No Third Party Claim shall be
settled by the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party.    

 (d) The respective indemnification obligations of the parties with respect to all Tax matters shall be governed by Section 9.3, and this Section 9.2 shall not be applicable to any such matters.   

 SECTION 9.3 _Tax Indemnification_.   

 (a) Following the Closing, Seller shall indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Company and the Subsidiaries) and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and other representatives and hold them harmless from (i) all Liability for Taxes of the Company, the Subsidiaries, the Joint Ventures and the Seller Group for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (including all Liability for Taxes of any member of the Seller Group for any Pre-Closing Tax Period imposed as a result of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502 or any corresponding provision of any state, local or non-U.S. Law), (ii) any Loss arising out of or resulting from the breach by Seller of any representation or warranty made by Seller in Section 3.16 of this Agreement, (iii) any Loss arising out of or resulting from the breach by Seller of any covenant or agreement made by Seller in Article VII of this Agreement, and (iv) all Liability for reasonable legal fees and expenses attributable to any item in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not have any indemnification obligation for any Liability for Taxes attributable to the total amount actually required to be included in the gross income of members of the Company Group for the Pre-Closing Tax Period as calculated under Section 951 of the Code (generally relating to Subpart F Income) to the extent such    ##### 

  

  

amount exceeds the total amount calculated on a closing-of-the-books basis,
net of any tax benefit in respect of any foreign tax credit allocable to such
excess to the extent and when such tax benefit is actually utilized by Seller
(determined applying the principles governing calculation and payment of Tax
Benefit and Reduced Tax Benefit set forth in Section 9.5(e)), to be included
in the gross income of members of the Company Group for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period under Section 951 of the Code. For the purposes of this Section
9.3(a), any reference to any "Liability" of any description shall be deemed
to include amounts that would have constituted a "Liability" but for the set-
off or other utilization of any loss, deduction or credit realized in, or
attributable to, a Post-Closing Tax Period.    

 (b) Following the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of the Company and each Subsidiary to, indemnify Seller and its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and hold them harmless from (i) all Liability for Taxes of the Company and the Subsidiaries for any Post-Closing Tax Period, (ii) all Liability for Taxes, calculated based on a 37.5% aggregate tax rate, on any Subpart F Income attributable to the Company Group for the Pre-Closing Tax Period as calculated under Section 951 of the Code to the extent such income exceeds the Subpart F Income attributable to the Company Group for the Pre-Closing Tax Period as calculated on a closing-of-the-books basis, net of any tax benefit in respect of any foreign tax credit allocable to such excess to the extent and when such tax benefit is actually utilized by Seller (determined applying the principles governing calculation and payment of Tax Benefit and Reduced Tax Benefit set forth in Section 9.5(e)), and (iii) all Liability for reasonable legal fees and expenses attributable to any item in clauses (i) and (ii). For the purposes of this Section 9.3(b) any reference to any "Liability" of any description shall be deemed to include amounts that would have constituted a "Liability" but for the set-off or other utilization of any loss, deduction or credit realized in, or attributable to, a Pre-Closing Tax Period.   

 (c) Any indemnity payment to be made hereunder shall be paid within ten (10) days after the indemnified party makes written demand upon the indemnifying party, but in no case earlier than five (5) Business Days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes (including any estimated Tax payments) are required to be paid to the relevant Taxing Authority.   

 (d) Reasonably promptly after a party becomes aware of the existence of a Tax issue that may give rise to an indemnification claim under this Section 9.3 (a "Tax Controversy") by it against the other party, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of the Tax issue, and thereafter shall promptly forward to the Indemnifying Party copies of notices and communications with a Taxing Authority relating to such Tax Controversy. Except as provided in this Section 9.3(d), the Indemnifying Party may elect to control, and may elect to have sole discretion in handling, settling or contesting any audit inquiry, information request, audit proceeding, suit, contest or any other action with respect to a Tax Controversy for which it would be required to indemnify the other party if it acknowledges in writing that it has sole liability for any Taxes that might arise in such proceeding. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any proceeding with respect to a Tax Controversy on a basis that would materially    ##### 

  

  

adversely affect the liability for Taxes of the Indemnified Party without
obtaining the Indemnified Partys written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The Indemnified Party shall not settle any Tax
Controversy without obtaining the Indemnifying Partys written consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the Indemnified Party in handling, settling or contesting a Tax Controversy
that the Indemnifying Party has elected to control under this Section 9.3(d)
shall be borne by the Indemnified Party. Seller and Purchaser shall jointly
control, and shall each have the right to participate in all activities and
strategic decisions with respect to, any Tax proceedings for which each party
would be required to indemnify the other party with respect to one or more
Tax issues. Seller may assume sole control of any such proceeding for any
Straddle Period if it acknowledges in writing that it has sole liability for
any Taxes that might arise in such proceeding.    

 (e) The indemnification provisions in this Agreement relating to Taxes shall survive the Closing until ninety (90) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof).   

 SECTION 9.4 _Limits on Indemnification_.   

 (a) No amount shall be payable by any Indemnifying Party pursuant to Sections 9.2(a) unless the aggregate amount of Losses indemnifiable under Sections 9.2(a) exceeds six million dollars ($6,000,000) of the Purchase Price (and then only to the extent of such excess).   

 (b) No amount shall be payable by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 9.2 for any breach of any representation or warranty or Section 9.3(a) for any Liability for Taxes resulting in aggregate Losses of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or less with respect to any matter or series of related matters and such Losses shall not be included in calculating the threshold established in Section 9.4(a).   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the maximum amount of aggregate indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from Seller arising out of or resulting from the causes enumerated in Section 9.2, other than in respect of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3(a) and (b), 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6, shall be an amount equal to two hundred forty million dollars ($240,000,000). The maximum amount of aggregate indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from Seller arising out of or resulting from the causes enumerated in Sections 9.2 and 9.3 (with respect to Section 9.3, to the extent relating to Taxes other than U.S. federal Taxes or Taxes imposed by a state or locality within the United States) in respect of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3(a) and (b), 3.4, 3.5 or 3.6 shall be an amount equal to the Purchase Price.   

 (d) The parties hereto waive as against each other any claims to consequential, special, exemplary or punitive damages, and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any award of consequential, special, exemplary or punitive damages shall not be included in calculating the amount of indemnifiable Losses hereunder except to the extent that such damages are included in indemnifiable Losses    ##### 

  

  

resulting from a third-party claim against an Indemnified Party; provided,
however, that, without limiting the waiver of consequential damages set forth
in this Section 9.4(d), the determination of Losses shall include
consideration of lost profits as an element of direct damages in appropriate
circumstances.    

 (e) Seller shall not have any indemnification obligation under this Article IX to the extent that the Company, a Subsidiary or a Joint Venture has accrued a liability or recorded a specifically allocated reserve or allowance in its financial statements in respect thereof, but only to the extent of such accrual or reserve, (i) as of September 24, 2004, or (ii) as a current liability as of the Closing Date that is subtracted from current assets in Closing Date Working Capital Computation.   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for purposes of determining an Indemnified Partys right to indemnification under this Agreement, all qualifications in Articles III and IV hereof relating to Knowledge, materiality and / or Material Adverse Effect shall be disregarded.   

 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Sellers maximum indemnification obligation under this Article IX with respect to any individual Loss incurred by any Person other than other than the Company or any 100%-owned Subsidiary shall for all purposes be limited to its Effective Economic Interest therein as of the Closing in the entity incurring such Loss.   

 SECTION 9.5 _Computation of Indemnifiable Losses_.   

 (a) Any amount payable pursuant to this Article IX (i) shall be decreased to the extent of any insurance proceeds received or receivable by the recipient of such amount in respect of an indemnifiable Loss as set forth in Section 9.7, and (ii) shall be reduced by any recoveries from third Persons pursuant to indemnification or otherwise in respect thereto.   

 (b) Reserved.   

 (c) The amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this Article IX shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction or, in the case of income tax indemnification under Section 9.3 hereof, "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code or its equivalent in jurisdictions outside the United States; or (iii) by any other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall agree. The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of Losses suffered by it.   

 (d) Any party receiving indemnity shall assign to the Indemnifying Party all of its claims for recovery against third Persons as to such Losses, whether by insurance coverage, contribution claims, subrogation or otherwise. In any case where an    ##### 

  

  

Indemnified Party recovers from third Persons any amount (other than any
amounts deducted pursuant to Section 9.5(e) hereof) in respect of a matter
with respect to which an Indemnifying Party has indemnified it pursuant to
this Article IX, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to
the Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the
full amount of the expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery), but
not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously so paid by the
Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of
such matter and (ii) any amount expended by the Indemnifying Party in
pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter.    

 (e) If either Purchaser or Seller is required to indemnify the other pursuant to the provisions of this Article IX for any Loss or Liability ("Indemnifiable Cost"), then (i) the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any Tax Benefit resulting from the payment of the Indemnifiable Cost by the Indemnified Party and (ii) the indemnity payment required to made by the Indemnifying Party shall be increased by the amount of any Tax Cost borne by the Indemnified Party with respect to such payment (or with respect to any increase in an indemnity payment as a result of this clause (ii)). The Tax Benefit reimbursement shall be made when actually realized by the Indemnified Party, whether such realization occurs in the year the indemnification payment is made or in a later year via a loss carryforward, foreign tax credit carryforward or otherwise. "Tax Benefit" shall mean the excess, if any, of (i) Taxes that would have been incurred by the Indemnified Party for the year at issue if the Indemnifiable Cost had not been incurred by the Indemnified Party, over (ii) the actual Taxes payable by the Indemnified Party. "Tax Cost" shall mean the amount of any Tax imposed upon a payment made pursuant to this Article IX and actually paid by the Indemnified Party in the taxable year in which the payment was received plus the value of any tax asset used to offset any such Tax, as determined by the Indemnified Party in good faith. In years subsequent to the year the Tax Benefit is realized, the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for the Reduced Tax Benefit, if any, resulting from the Tax consequences of the Indemnifiable Cost. "Reduced Tax Benefit" shall mean the difference, if any, between the Taxes actually incurred by the Indemnified Party in the subsequent year at issue and the Taxes that the Indemnified Party would have incurred had the Indemnifiable Cost not been incurred by the Indemnified Party. Where an Indemnified Party has losses, deductions, credits or other items available to it, the Tax Benefit from an Indemnifiable Cost shall be treated for purposes of this section as actually realized only after the utilization of all such other losses, deductions, credits or other items. The amount of any reimbursement hereunder shall be adjusted to reflect any final determination with respect to the Indemnified Partys liability for Taxes, and payments required by this Section 9.5(e) relating to Tax Benefits shall be satisfied by a separate cash payment to the party entitled to the benefit of such reimbursement, shall be separate from any other indemnification obligation under this Article IX, and the amount due under this Section 9.5(e) shall not delay or affect any other amounts due under this Article IX. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the obligations of the parties under this Section 9.5(e) with respect to reimbursements for Tax Benefits and Reduced Tax Benefits shall not be subject to a deductible, threshold or similar concept and shall be unlimited in amount.    ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 9.6 _Indemnification as Exclusive Remedy_. The indemnification provided in this Article IX and Article XII, subject to the limitations set forth herein, shall be the exclusive post-Closing remedy available to any party for any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant by the other party contained herein.   

 SECTION 9.7 _Mitigation of Damages_.   

 (a) An Indemnified Party shall, to the extent practicable and reasonably within its control and at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, make commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any damages of which it has adequate notice, provided that the Indemnified Party shall not be obligated to act in contravention of applicable Law or in contravention of reasonable and customary practices of a prudent person in similar circumstances. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, and shall be afforded the opportunity by the Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably possible, to make commercially reasonable efforts to minimize damages before such damages actually are incurred by the Indemnified Party.   

 (b) Each Indemnified Party shall maintain such insurance coverage with respect to its business as is customary for an entity of the size and nature of such Indemnified Party. Each Indemnified Party shall be obligated in connection with any claim for indemnification under this Article IX to use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any insurance proceeds and indemnification payments payable to such Indemnified Party by any third party available with regard to the applicable claims. The amount which the Indemnifying Party is or may be required to pay to any Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX shall be reduced (retroactively, if necessary) by any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments or other amounts actually recovered by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in reduction of the related damages. If the Indemnified Party shall have received the payment required by this Agreement from the Indemnifying Party in respect of damages and shall subsequently receive insurance proceeds, indemnification payments or other amounts in respect of such damages, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly repay to the Indemnifying Party a sum equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds, indemnification payments or other amounts actually received.   

ARTICLE X

 SECTION 10.3 _Termination Fee_. Purchaser agrees to pay to Seller a fee equal to 2% of the Purchase Price if this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 10.1(iv) as a result of a material breach of covenant by Purchaser.

 (b) Seller agrees to pay to Purchaser a fee equal to 2% of the Purchase Price if this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.1(v) as a result    ##### 

  

  

of a material breach of covenant by Seller. Any such payment by Seller to
Purchaser shall be in addition to and shall not limit any other legal or

ARTICLE XI   

GENERAL PROVISIONS   

 SECTION 11.1 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, all costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants (including any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission), incurred in connection with this Agreement, the agreements contemplated hereby to be executed by the parties and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred.   

 SECTION 11.2 _Disclaimer Regarding Projections; No Additional Representations; Disclaimer of Warranties_.   

 (a) In connection with Purchasers investigation of the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures, Purchaser has received from Seller, the Company, the Subsidiaries and/or the Joint Ventures certain projections and other forecasts and certain business plan information. Purchaser acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections and other forecasts and plans, that Purchaser is familiar with such uncertainties, that Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it, and that Purchaser shall have no claim against anyone with respect thereto. Accordingly, Purchaser acknowledges that Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to such projections, forecasts or plans.   

 (b) Purchaser acknowledges that it and its representatives have been permitted sufficient access to the books and records, facilities, equipment, Tax Returns, contracts, insurance policies (or summaries thereof) and other properties and assets of the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures that it and its representatives have desired or requested to see or review to make its decision to enter into this Agreement, and that it and its representatives have had a full opportunity to meet with the officers and employees of the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures to discuss the business of the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures. Purchaser acknowledges that (i) none of Seller, the Company, the Subsidiaries, the Joint Ventures or any other Person has made any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to the Company, any Subsidiary or any Joint Venture or the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures furnished or made available to Purchaser and its representatives, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, (ii) Purchaser has not relied on any representation or warranty from Seller, the Company, the Subsidiaries, the Joint Ventures or any other Person in determining to enter into this Agreement, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iii) none of Seller, any of its Affiliates (including the Company, the Subsidiaries and    ##### 

  

  

the Joint Ventures) or any other Person shall have or be subject to any
liability to Purchaser or any other Person resulting from the distribution to
Purchaser, or Purchasers use of, any such information, including the
Confidential Memorandum prepared by Citigroup Global Markets Inc. that sets
forth certain information relating to the Company, the Subsidiaries and the
Joint Ventures (or any supplement thereto or update thereof) and any
information, documents or material made available to Purchaser in any "data
rooms," management presentations or in any other form in expectation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.    

 (c) EXCEPT AS TO THOSE MATTERS EXPRESSLY COVERED BY THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE CERTIFICATE DELIVERED BY SELLER PURSUANT TO SECTION 8.2(a), SELLER IS SELLING THE SHARES (AND THE BUSINESS AND ASSETS OF THE COMPANY REPRESENTED THEREBY) ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND SELLER DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTIES WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NO IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER. The representations and warranties are included in this Agreement as a matter of risk allocation only and the inaccuracy or breach of any representation and warranty in no event shall be used as evidence of or be deemed to constitute bad faith, misconduct, misrepresentation or fraud by Seller even if it is shown that Seller knew or should have known that such representation and warranty was incorrect when made.   

 SECTION 11.3 _Materiality; Schedules_.   

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the term "material" and the concept of the "material" nature of an effect upon the Company shall be measured relative to the entire business of the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures, taken as a whole, as such business is currently being conducted. The fact that there have been included in the Schedules and may be included elsewhere in this Agreement items which are not "material" within the meaning of the immediately preceding sentence shall not be deemed to be an admission or agreement by Seller that such items are "material" or to further define the meaning of such term for purposes of this Agreement.   

 (b) Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in any Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Neither the specification of any item or matter in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters,    ##### 

  

  

are or are not in the ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the
fact of the setting forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter not described herein or included in any Schedule is or is not in the
ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. Seller may at the
Closing, by notice in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, supplement,
amend or create any Schedule in order to add information or correct previously
supplied information. No such amendment shall be evidence, in and of itself,
that the representations and warranties in the corresponding section are no
longer true and correct in all material respects. It is specifically agreed
that such Schedules may be amended to add immaterial, as well as material,
items thereto; provided, however, that no supplemental, amended or additional
Schedule shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
of Seller set forth in this Agreement or be deemed to cure any breach for
purposes of this Agreement.    

 SECTION 11.4 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given or made (and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made upon receipt) by delivery in person, by courier service, by telecopy or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) to the respective parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified in a notice given in accordance with this Section 11.4:

 SECTION 11.5 _Public Announcements_. No party to this Agreement shall make, or cause to be made, any press release or public announcement in respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise communicate with any news media without the prior written consent of the other parties, and the parties shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any such press release or public announcement; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other parties, make such press release or public announcement as may be required by Law or any listing agreement with a securities exchange if it has used its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other parties and to obtain such parties consent but has been unable to do so in a timely manner. Nothing in this Section 11.5 shall interfere with Sellers reporting obligations under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.   

 SECTION 11.6 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.   

 SECTION 11.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.   

 SECTION 11.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.   

 SECTION 11.9 _Assignment_. Other than by Purchaser in accordance with Section 12.1 hereof, this Agreement may not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise by any party without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of such other party). Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 11.9 shall be void.    ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 11.10 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the provisions of Article IX relating to Indemnified Parties, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties and their permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.   

 SECTION 11.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties.   

 SECTION 11.12 _Waiver_. Any party to this Agreement may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of another party contained herein or in any document delivered by another party pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of another party contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition, of this Agreement. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights.   

 SECTION 11.13 _Governing Law; Waiver of Right to Jury Trial; Waiver of Immunity_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within that state. All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined in any New York state or Federal court sitting in the City of New York, and the parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. To the extent that any party has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, such party hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its obligations with respect to this Agreement. Each party irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies of such process to such party at its address specified in Section 11.4. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Section 11.13 shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this Section 11.13 shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of New York and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this Section 11.13 and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties. Each party hereto irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action with respect to this Agreement, any right to a trial by jury. To the extent that Purchaser, Seller or any of their    ##### 

  

  

respective revenues, assets or properties shall be entitled with respect to
any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
at any time brought against Purchaser, Seller or any of their respective
revenues, assets or properties in any applicable jurisdiction, or with
respect to any suit, action or proceeding at any time brought solely for the
purpose of enforcing or executing any judgment or award in any applicable
jurisdiction, to any immunity, on the grounds of sovereignty or otherwise,
from suit, from the jurisdiction of any court, from attachment prior to
judgment, from attachment in aid of execution of judgment, from execution of a
judgment or from any other legal or judicial process or remedy, and to the
extent that in any such jurisdiction there shall be attributed such an
immunity, each of Purchaser and Seller hereby irrevocably agrees not to claim
and irrevocably waives such immunity to the fullest extent permitted by the
laws of such jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 of the United States). In addition, to the
extent that Purchaser, Seller or any of their respective revenues, assets or
properties shall be entitled, in any jurisdiction, to any immunity from
setoff, bankers lien or any similar right or remedy, and to the extent that
there shall be attributed, in any jurisdiction, such an immunity, each of
Purchaser and Seller hereby irrevocably agrees not to claim and irrevocably
waives such immunity to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of such
jurisdiction with respect to any claim, suit, action, proceeding, right or
remedy arising out of or in connection with the Agreement.    

 SECTION 11.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the parties in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.   

ARTICLE XII   

PURCHASER ASSIGNMENT and GUARANTEE   

 SECTION 12.1 _Purchaser Assignment and Guarantee_. Seller hereby agrees that Purchaser may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more directly or indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries of Purchaser (the "Assigned Purchaser"); provided that, in the event of such assignment, Purchaser shall remain bound to perform any unperformed obligation under this Agreement.

The Guarantor and the Indemnitor, jointly and severally, represent and warrant that Schedule C sets forth a true and accurate list of each agreement under which such CSX Covenant arises (although any failure to list any CSX Covenant or CSX Obligation required to be so listed will constitute only a breach of this representation and warranty and shall not relieve the Guarantor and the Indemnitor of any obligation or payment, performance or compliance hereunder).   

 (c) The agreement of the Indemnitor set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement (the "Indemnitor Covenant") is a covenant of payment, performance and compliance, and is in no way conditioned or contingent upon any performance or compliance by a Indemnified Party or its respective successors or assigns under any agreement or instrument which is the subject of a Residual Liability (each such agreement or instrument, a "CSX Obligation").   

 (d) If the Indemnitor fails promptly to fulfill its obligations under the Indemnitor Covenant with respect to any CSX Covenant, or elects not to cure or prevent the occurrence of a breach under the relevant CSX Obligation as contemplated by Section 20(m) hereof, the Indemnified Party may, but is not obligated to, fulfill any such CSX Covenant. Unless the Indemnified Partys failure to do so could subject the Indemnified Party to criminal liability, significant consequential damages or a material adverse effect to its business or condition, the Indemnified Party agrees that it will not so fulfill any such CSX Covenant if and to the extent that the Indemnitor shall have delivered to the Beneficiary a writing stating that the Indemnitor disputes in good faith that payment or performance of such CSX Covenant is due but clearly and unconditionally acknowledging liability therefor hereunder in the event that payment or performance is in fact due. Any amounts so paid and all costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of outside counsel and outside accountants and other reasonably necessary professional experts) incurred by the Indemnified Party in fulfilling any CSX Covenant or otherwise in enforcing or preserving any of its rights under the Indemnitor Covenant and all other amounts due from the Indemnitor hereunder to the Indemnified Party shall be payable by the Indemnitor or the Guarantor as incurred upon demand of the Indemnified Party therefor.  

SECTION 3. _Residual Assets_.    

 (a) The Guarantor and the Indemnitor jointly and severally represent and warrant that Schedule A sets forth a true and accurate list of each Residual Asset as of the date hereof.   

 (b) The Purchaser and the Beneficiary shall use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer, assign or otherwise distribute to Seller (for no or nominal consideration) all of the Beneficiarys right, title and interest in and to the Residual Assets (the "Transfers") as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that such efforts shall not include making any monetary payments in connection therewith, and any and all such monetary payments shall be the sole responsibility and obligation of Seller. The Purchaser and the    ##### 

  

 

Beneficiary shall cooperate with Sellers employees, agents
and representatives in any reasonable arrangement designed to provide Seller
with all of the benefits in and to all such Residual Assets until the
Transfers have been effected. At Sellers request, the Purchaser and the
Beneficiary, at Sellers expense, shall take or cause to be taken all
commercially reasonable efforts requested by Seller to enforce, for the
benefit of Seller, any and all right, title and interest in and to any such
Residual Asset not otherwise transferred and assigned pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement. The Purchaser and the Beneficiary each agree to
remit promptly to Seller all collections, payments and other forms of
consideration received by the Purchaser or the Beneficiary or any of their
respective affiliates in respect of all such Residual Assets, and shall hold
all such collections, payments and other consideration for the benefit of,
and promptly pay the same over to, Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing herein shall create or provide any rights or benefits in or to the
Residual Assets for or in any third party. In no event shall the Purchaser or
the Beneficiary, sell, transfer, assign, lease, license or otherwise dispose
of, or pledge, mortgage, grant a security interest in or otherwise encumber
any right or interest in any of the Residual Assets, except in accordance
with this Agreement.   

SECTION 4. _Indemnity Agreement_.    

 (a) The Indemnitor hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Purchaser and the Beneficiary and each of their present and future subsidiaries, joint ventures, shareholders, directors, officers, partners, affiliates, employees, successors and assigns, (a party or parties being indemnified being referred to herein as an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, charges, actions, judgments, suits, proceedings, governmental investigations, deficiencies, taxes, interests, penalties, costs and expenses (including interest and penalties, reasonable costs of investigation, and the reasonable fees, disbursements and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other reasonably necessary processional experts) (collectively, the "Losses") imposed upon or incurred by an Indemnified Party resulting from or arising directly or indirectly out of the Residual Liabilities, the Residual Assets and the CSX Obligations (the "Indemnity").   

 (b) In the event a claim or demand covered by the Indemnity is brought against an Indemnified Party (an "Indemnified Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnitor or the Guarantor written notice of such Indemnified Claim (a "Claim Notice") within 10 days after receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Indemnified Claim; provided, however, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, that failure to give such Claim Notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except if and only to the extent that the Indemnitor shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.   

 (c) The Indemnitor, promptly after receipt of a Claim Notice and after consultation with the Beneficiary, shall determine whether such Indemnified Claim shall be deemed to be a Post-Closing Date CSX Dispute. If such Indemnified Claim is determined to be a Post-Closing Date CSX Dispute, the Indemnitor or the Guarantor shall assume the defense thereof in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 10 of this Agreement.   

 (d) If the Indemnitor, after consultation with the Beneficiary, determines that an Indemnified Claim is not a CSX Dispute, the Indemnitor shall so notify the Indemnified Party that delivered the Claim Notice with an acknowledgement to such Indemnified Party of its rights    ##### 

  

 

under the Indemnity. The Indemnitor or the Guarantor shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of such Indemnified Claim and, if it
so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
Indemnitor and reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Party; provided,
that the Indemnitor acknowledges to the Indemnified Party its right to
indemnity pursuant hereto in respect of the entirety of such claim (as such
claim may have been modified through written agreement of the parties
hereunder). Should the Indemnitor so elect to assume the defense of an
Indemnified Claim, the Indemnitor shall not be liable to the Indemnified
Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof, but shall continue to pay for any Losses
suffered to the extent provided under the Indemnity. If the Indemnitor
assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitor. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Indemnitor shall not assume the defense of an Indemnified
Claim within 10 business days after it receives any Claim Notice, such
Indemnified Claim shall be deemed not to be a CSX Dispute and the Indemnified
Party, by written notice to the Indemnitor, may employ one counsel of its own
and control the defense of such Indemnified Claim and the Indemnitor shall be
liable for the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of such counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party shall
be promptly reimbursed for any such fees, charges and disbursements, as and
when incurred upon written request to the Indemnitor or the Guarantor along
with documentation in support thereof.    

 (e) Whether the Indemnitor or the Indemnified Party controls the defense of any Indemnified Claim, the parties shall cooperate in the defense thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and provision to the counsel to the controlling party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Indemnified Claim, and making employees and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation or testimony for any material provided hereunder or with respect to relevant facts as set forth in Sections 12 and 13 of this Agreement, in each case, at the expense of the Indemnitor or the Guarantor.   

 (f) If the Indemnitor or the Guarantor shall have assumed the defense of an Indemnified Claim, it shall have the right to settle, compromise or discharge such Indemnified Claim (other than any such Indemnified Claim in which criminal conduct is alleged) without the Indemnified Partys consent if such settlement, compromise or discharge (i) constitutes a complete and unconditional discharge and release of all Indemnified Parties and (ii) provides for no obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party other than the payment of monetary damages and such monetary damages are paid in full by the Indemnitor or the Guarantor, and in all other cases may not so settle without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld).   

 (g) The rights accorded to the Indemnified Parties under the Indemnity shall be in addition to any rights that any Indemnified Party may have at law or in equity under the laws of any governmental authority, but no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to cumulative recoveries in excess of its losses.  

SECTION 5. _Subrogation; Subordination_.     ##### 

  

     

 The Indemnitor shall be subrogated to the rights of any Indemnified Party (i) with respect to which a payment shall have been made by the Indemnitor pursuant to the terms of the Indemnity as and when such payment shall have been made by the Indemnitor, or (ii) for the benefit of which the Indemnitor shall have fulfilled or caused to be fulfilled any CSX Actions as and when the Indemnitor shall have fulfilled or caused to be fulfilled such CSX Actions; provided, that the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to receive payment arising from payment or performance by the Indemnitor pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and any such payment shall be subordinate to, and junior in right of payment of, the CSX Payments until the CSX Payments shall be paid in full.  

SECTION 6. _Taxes; Recoveries_.    

 (a) Any amount payable by the Indemnitor or the Guarantor pursuant to this Agreement shall (retroactively if necessary) (i) be decreased to the extent of any insurance proceeds received by any Indemnified Party in respect of any Loss, Residual Liability or CSX Obligation, and (ii) be reduced by any actual recoveries from third Persons pursuant to indemnification or otherwise in respect thereto to the extent attributable to the Losses of any Indemnified Party.   

 (b) After receipt by any Indemnified Party of payment in full for all Losses pursuant to the Indemnity, if such Indemnified Party recovers from third Persons any amount (other than any amounts previously deducted pursuant to Section 6(a) hereof), such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnitor or the Guarantor the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery to the extent such amount recovered does not exceed the amount paid by the Indemnitor pursuant to the Indemnity).   

 (c) If the Indemnitor is required to indemnify an Indemnified Party for any Loss ("Indemnifiable Cost"), then (i) the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnitor for any Tax Benefit resulting from the payment of the Indemnifiable Cost by the Indemnified Party and (ii) the indemnity payment required to made by the Indemnitor shall be increased by the amount of any Tax Cost borne by the Indemnified Party with respect to such payment (or with respect to any increase in an indemnity payment as a result of this clause (ii)). The Tax Benefit reimbursement shall be made when actually realized by the Indemnified Party, whether such realization occurs in the year the indemnification payment is made or in a later year via a loss carryforward, foreign tax credit carryforward or otherwise. "Tax Benefit" shall mean the excess, if any, of (i) Taxes that would have been incurred by the Indemnified Party for the year at issue if the Indemnifiable Cost had not been incurred by the Indemnified Party, over (ii) the actual Taxes payable by the Indemnified Party. "Tax Cost" shall mean the amount of any Tax imposed upon a payment made pursuant to this Agreement and actually paid by the Indemnified Party in the taxable year in which the payment was received, plus the value of any tax asset used to offset any such Tax, as determined by the Indemnified Party in good faith. In years subsequent to the year the Tax Benefit is realized, the Indemnitor shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for the Reduced Tax Benefit, if any, resulting from the Tax consequences of the Indemnifiable Cost. "Reduced Tax Benefit" shall mean the difference, if any, between the Taxes actually incurred by the Indemnified Party in the subsequent year at issue and the Taxes that the Indemnified Party would have incurred had the Indemnifiable Cost not been incurred by the Indemnified Party.    ##### 

  

 

Where an Indemnified Party has losses, deductions, credits or
other items available to it, the Tax Benefit from an Indemnifiable Cost
shall be treated for purposes of this section as actually realized only after
the utilization of all such other losses, deductions, credits or other items.
The amount of any reimbursement hereunder shall be adjusted to reflect any
final determination with respect to the Indemnified Partys liability for
Taxes, and payments required by this Section 6(c) relating to Tax Benefits
shall be satisfied by a separate cash payment to the party entitled to the
benefit of such reimbursement, shall be separate from any other
indemnification obligation under this Agreement, and the amount due under
this Section 6(c) shall not delay or affect any other amounts due under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
obligations of the parties with respect to reimbursements for Tax Benefits
and Reduced Tax Benefits shall not be subject to a deductible, threshold or
similar concept and shall be unlimited in amount.   

SECTION 7. _Certain Rights and Powers of the Beneficiary and the Indemnified
Parties_. The Indemnitor Covenant and the Indemnity are made solely for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable only by the Indemnified Parties. No
Person other than the Indemnified Parties is an intended beneficiary hereof
and no person other than the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce
the obligations of the Indemnitor hereunder. No failure to exercise and no
delay in exercising, on the part of any Indemnified Party, any right, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege preclude any
other exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other power or right.   

SECTION 8. _Assignment_. The Indemnitor hereby consents to the assignment by
any of the Indemnified Parties or their successors or assigns any of their
respective rights and interests in this Agreement but only in connection with
and to the extent of a delegation of the associated obligations of such
Indemnified Party under the relevant CSX Residual Liability or CSX Obligation
pursuant to the provisions thereof relating to assignment of rights or
delegation of duties upon a consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer
or lease of all or substantially all assets, or a substantially similar
provision. Each of the Purchaser and the Beneficiary hereby consents to the
assignment or delegation by the Indemnitor or any successor or assignee
thereof of the rights and obligations of the Indemnitor under this Agreement
to any affiliate thereof; provided, that prior to such assignment or
delegation, the Guarantor acknowledges in writing to the Purchaser and the
Beneficiary that the guarantee set forth in Section 16 of this Agreement
hereof shall apply to such affiliate as though such affiliate were the
Indemnitor hereunder.   

SECTION 9. _Term of Agreement_. The Indemnitor Covenant and the Indemnity
shall continue in full force and effect and shall not be discharged until
such time as all of the CSX Payments have been paid in full and all of the
agreements of the Indemnitor in respect of all the CSX Actions have been duly
performed or complied with, after which the Indemnitor Covenant and
the Indemnity will terminate and be of no force and effect against the
Indemnitor except in respect of any indemnification under the Indemnity in
respect of any Claim Notice delivered prior to 30 days after such termination
or as otherwise expressly provided herein.   

SECTION 10. _Control of the CSX Disputes_. The Guarantor and the Indemnitor
jointly and severally represent and warrant that Schedule B sets forth a true
and accurate list of the CSX Disputes as of the date hereof.     ##### 

  

     

 (b) On and after the Closing Date, the Guarantor shall assume and control the defense of all CSX Disputes at its sole expense and through counsel of its sole choice, and neither the Purchaser nor the Beneficiary shall have any right or obligation to participate in the defense of the CSX Disputes, except as and only to the extent otherwise expressly provided herein. In furtherance thereof, the Beneficiary hereby grants the Guarantor the irrevocable right and power to file, serve, and take other necessary or advisable actions with respect to, pleadings, filings, motions, briefs, subpoenas, praecipae, notices, correspondence and other applicable documents under, using or on behalf of the Beneficiary in the course of any CSX Dispute. In the name of or on behalf of the Beneficiary, the Guarantor may, in its sole discretion, settle or compromise any CSX Dispute; provided, however, that the Guarantor shall not consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to a CSX Dispute without the prior written consent of the Beneficiary (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) unless such settlement does not have a material adverse effect on the Purchaser or the Beneficiary.   

 (c) The Purchaser and the Beneficiary each shall cooperate with the Guarantor in such defense and make available to the Guarantor all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information relating thereto in the Purchasers and/or the Beneficiarys control or possession as is reasonably required by the Guarantor (as further described in Sections 12 and 13 hereof). The Purchaser and the Beneficiary shall each promptly forward to the Guarantor any correspondence, filings, pleadings or other documents or communications received by the Beneficiary or the Purchaser in the course of any CSX Dispute.   

 (d) The Purchaser and the Beneficiary acknowledge and agree that the Beneficiary has the exclusive and irrevocable right to select, hire, fire and replace counsel to represent the Beneficiary in any CSX Dispute and agrees to be represented by such counsel with respect to such CSX Dispute. The Purchaser and the Beneficiary understand that counsel will represent the Beneficiary and the Guarantor simultaneously in any such CSX Dispute and hereby waive any actual or potential conflicts that may or could arise solely as a result of this joint representation. Notwithstanding any actual or potential conflicts that may exist or arise, the Purchaser and the Beneficiary agree that, to the extent not prohibited under applicable rules of professional responsibility, each law firm/legal counsel identified on Schedule B as currently representing the Beneficiary in connection with a CSX Dispute may represent the Guarantor and the Beneficiary in the future as to those CSX Disputes and any other CSX Disputes arising from or related to similar facts and circumstances.   

 (e) The Guarantor shall promptly reimburse the Purchaser or the Beneficiary for all of its or their costs, charges and expenses as incurred in connection with assisting the Guarantor pursuant this Section 10.  

SECTION 11. _Control of the Privileges_.    

 (a) _Assignment of the Privileges_. The Beneficiary hereby assigns to the Guarantor the right to assert and waive any of the Privileges, but only in connection with a CSX Dispute, and only to the extent that the Beneficiary would have had the right to assert or waive such Privileges but for the consummation of the SLSI Purchase; provided, that the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that this assignment of the right to assert or waive any of the Privileges by the Purchaser and the Beneficiary in favor of the Guarantor in connection with the CSX    ##### 

  

 

Disputes is not, and shall not be construed as, an abandonment of any of the
respective rights of the Purchaser and the Beneficiary in the
Privileges.    

 (b) _No Waiver of Privileges_. Because the Guarantor, the Beneficiary and the Purchaser believe that the Privileged Materials exchanged pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will remain confidential or privileged, the Guarantor, the Beneficiary and the Purchaser agree that this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of the Privileges. The Guarantor, the Beneficiary and the Purchaser also agree that unauthorized disclosure of any CSX Data or CSX Retained Data does not constitute, nor shall it be deemed to constitute, any waiver of privilege concerning such CSX Data or CSX Retained Data and that none of the parties hereto is authorized to waive any privilege held by the other.  

SECTION 12. _Access to Data_.    

 (a) At the request of the Guarantor any time after the Closing Date, the Purchaser or the Beneficiary shall provide the Guarantor or its representative(s) with timely access at the offices of the Purchaser or the Beneficiary during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to all CSX Data in the possession of the Purchaser or the Beneficiary and shall permit the Guarantor or its representative(s) (at the Guarantors expense) to make copies of any CSX Data in the possession of the Purchaser or the Beneficiary in order to allow the Guarantor to conduct any arbitration or other litigation arising out of or in connection with any Indemnified Claim, to respond to subpoenas or requests for documents or for any other reason arising out of or in connection with any Indemnified Claim.   

 (b) Each of the Purchaser and the Beneficiary hereby consents and agrees that CSX may retain copies or originals of any CSX Data after the Closing Date that are in its possession prior to the Closing Date.   

 (c) Neither the Purchaser nor the Beneficiary (nor any of their respective successor companies) shall sell, transfer, convey, assign, destroy or dispose of any CSX Data or copies of any CSX Data in its possession for a period of ten (10) years from the Closing Date, without the express written consent of the Guarantor, and thereafter, neither the Purchaser nor the Beneficiary shall destroy or dispose of any of such CSX Data, or copies of any CSX Data, unless an offer is first made in writing at least 60 days prior to such proposed destruction or disposition to surrender them to the Guarantor. The Guarantor shall not sell, transfer, convey, assign, destroy or dispose of any CSX Retained Data in its possession, or copies of any CSX Retained Data, for a period of ten (10) years from the Closing Date, without the express written consent of the Purchaser or the Beneficiary, and thereafter, the Guarantor shall not destroy or dispose of any of such CSX Retained Data, or copies of any CSX Retained Data, unless it first offers in writing at least 60 days prior to such proposed destruction or disposition to surrender them to the Purchaser or the Beneficiary.  

SECTION 13. _Access to Relevant Employees_.    

 (a) At the request of the Guarantor any time after the Closing Date, the Purchaser and the Beneficiary shall provide the Guarantor or its representative(s) with timely access to any Relevant Employee who is at the time of such request an employee of the Purchaser, the    ##### 

  

 

Beneficiary or any of their affiliates (or their respective successor
companies controlled by the Purchaser or the Beneficiary) and whom the
Guarantor reasonably believes to have knowledge of any CSX Data or to be
familiar with information relevant to any Indemnified Claim in order to allow
the Guarantor to conduct any arbitration or other litigation arising out of
or in connection with any Indemnified Claim, conduct interviews, question,
depose or obtain the testimony of such employees on matters arising out of or
in connection with any Indemnified Claim or for any other reason arising out
of or in connection with any Indemnified Claim.    

 (b) Each party shall cooperate with other parties with respect to scheduling and other matters so as to minimize the interference with any Relevant Employees regular employment duties.   

 (c) The Guarantor shall promptly reimburse the Purchaser or the Beneficiary, as applicable, upon request therefor for any costs or expenses incurred by either of them in connection with assisting the Guarantor pursuant to this Agreement, including for purposes hereof, the labor costs of any Relevant Employees who are made available to the Guarantor or its representatives pursuant to Section 12 of this Agreement.  

SECTION 14. _Confidentiality_.    

 (a) The Guarantor has used reasonable endeavors prior to the Closing to identify and mark clearly, using designations such as "Privileged-Attorney Work Product" or "Attorney Client Communication" or other appropriate designation, all the CSX Data in the possession of CSXWT or any of its subsidiaries. At the Guarantors request, the Beneficiary will cause CSXWT and its subsidiaries to mark clearly in a similar manner any CSX Data specifically identified by the Guarantor as in the possession of CSXWT or any of its subsidiaries.   

 (b) Each of the parties hereto agrees that it shall, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any of their respective affiliates or representatives to, keep all Privileged Materials in its possession confidential and shall not disclose any such Privileged Materials intentionally to anyone other than an Intended Recipient (as defined below); provided, however, such obligation of the Beneficiary shall apply only to CSX Data marked pursuant to Section 14(a) that is in the possession of CSXWT or any of its subsidiaries. The term "Intended Recipient" includes only the following: (i) attorneys and other advisors and other persons who are representing or assisting any of the Guarantor, the Indemnitor, the Purchaser and the Beneficiary and (ii) employees of the parties hereto or any of their respective affiliates, in each case, with respect to the provision of legal services reasonably necessary to analyze legal issues arising now or in the future with respect to the Privileged Materials.   

 (c) Each of the parties hereto shall take appropriate steps to protect the confidentiality of documents in its possession containing any Privileged Materials, such as handling and storing such documents appropriately and placing a copy of this Agreement in a highly visible place with files containing any Privileged Materials. In the event of a disclosure by one party hereto, or by any of its affiliates or representatives, in violation of this Agreement, such party shall inform the others immediately and take all reasonable steps available to retrieve the information or documents disclosed and to prevent further disclosure.    ##### 

  

  

 (d) The parties hereto agree that (i) neither the Beneficiary nor the Purchaser shall disclose any CSX Privileged Materials to any person or entity other than an Intended Recipient or the Guarantor, unless disclosure is made pursuant to a lawful order of a court of competent jurisdiction or as part of a proceeding arising out of any dispute between the parties hereto pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or otherwise; provided, that the Beneficiary or the Purchaser shall take all necessary steps to ensure the confidentiality of such disclosed material in such proceeding and such disclosure shall not be deemed to compromise the confidential and/or privileged status of such material, and (ii) neither the Guarantor nor the Indemnitor shall disclose any SL Service Privileged Materials to any person or entity other than an Intended Recipient, the Purchaser or the Beneficiary, unless disclosure is made pursuant to a lawful order of a court of competent jurisdiction or as part of a proceeding arising out of any dispute between the parties hereto pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or otherwise; provided, that the Guarantor shall take all necessary steps to ensure the confidentiality of such disclosed material in such proceeding and such disclosure shall not be deemed to compromise the confidential and/or privileged status of such material.   

 (e) Each of the parties hereto shall cooperate to prevent disclosure of any of the Privileged Materials to any third party or in any judicial proceeding or in any matter before any other tribunal other than any proceeding arising out of any dispute between the parties hereto pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or otherwise; provided, that the parties shall take all necessary steps to ensure the confidentiality of such disclosed material in such proceeding and such disclosure shall not be deemed to compromise the confidential and/or privileged status of any of the Privileged Materials with respect to other Persons.   

 (f) If the Beneficiary, the Purchaser or any of their respective affiliates or representatives is requested to disclose any CSX Privileged Materials in its possession, the Beneficiary or the Purchaser shall, or shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its affiliate or representative to, promptly notify the Guarantor to permit the Guarantor to assert its privileges and seek a protective order or take other action that the Guarantor in its discretion deems appropriate, and the Beneficiary or the Purchaser shall, or shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such affiliate or representative to, cooperate in any such effort to obtain a protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded such CSX Privileged Materials. If, in the absence of a protective order and after giving of notice to the Guarantor, the Beneficiary, the Purchaser or any of their respective affiliates or representatives is compelled as a matter of law or pursuant to legal process to disclose any of the CSX Privileged Materials in any proceeding, the Beneficiary, the Purchaser or any such affiliate or representative may disclose to the party compelling disclosure only such part of the CSX Privileged Materials as is required by law to be disclosed (in which case, prior to such disclosure, the Beneficiary or the Purchaser shall, or shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its affiliate or representative to, advise and consult with the Guarantor and its counsel as to such disclosure and the nature and wording of such disclosure) and the Beneficiary or the Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause any such affiliate or representative to obtain, confidential treatment therefor.   

 (g) If the Guarantor, the Indemnitor or any of their respective affiliates or representatives is requested to disclose any SL Service Privileged Materials in its possession, the Guarantor or the Indemnitor, as the case may be, shall, or shall use commercially reasonable    ##### 

  

 

efforts to cause its affiliate or representative to, promptly notify the
Beneficiary and the Purchaser to permit the Beneficiary and the Purchaser to
assert their respective privileges and seek a protective order or take other
action that the Beneficiary and the Purchaser in their discretion deems
appropriate, and the Guarantor or the Indemnitor, as the case may be, shall,
or shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such affiliate or
representative to, cooperate in any such effort to obtain a protective order
or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded
such SL Service Privileged Materials. If, in the absence of a protective
order and after giving of notice to the Beneficiary and the Purchaser, the
Guarantor, the Indemnitor or any of their respective affiliates or
representatives is compelled as a matter of law or pursuant to legal process
to disclose any of the SL Service Privileged Materials in any proceeding, the
Guarantor, the Indemnitor or any such affiliate or representative may
disclose to the party compelling disclosure only such part of the SL Service
Privileged Materials as is required by law to be disclosed (in which case,
prior to such disclosure, the Guarantor or the Indemnitor, as the case may
be, shall, or shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
affiliate or representative to, advise and consult with the Beneficiary and
the Purchaser and their counsel as to such disclosure and the nature and
wording of such disclosure) and the Guarantor or the Indemnitor, as the case
may be, shall use reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause any such affiliate
or representative to obtain, confidential treatment therefor.    

 (h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the parties hereto has any obligation to keep confidential: (i) information that becomes generally available to the public, unless that availability is the result of unauthorized disclosure; or (ii) information that is received from a third party without violation of confidentiality by that disclosing third-party.   

SECTION 15. _Effective Date_. This Agreement shall be effective as of the
Closing Date at a time immediately prior to the purchase of the shares of
capital stock of the Beneficiary by the Purchaser pursuant to the terms
of the Purchase Agreement.   

SECTION 16. _The Guarantor Guarantee_. The Guarantor hereby unconditionally
and irrevocably guarantees, as a principal and not as a surety, to each
Indemnified Party the prompt and complete payment and performance of the
obligations of the Indemnitor, its successors or its and their
assigns, arising hereunder when due, whether upon demand or otherwise,
(including amounts that would become due but for the operation of the
automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §
362(a) or comparable foreign law), whether now in existence or hereafter
arising and shall indemnify each Indemnified Party for any costs, charges and
expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in enforcing this Section 16\.
This Guarantee is one of payment and not of collection. The Guarantors
liability hereunder is direct, primary and unconditional, and may be enforced
by any Indemnified Party without  first resorting to any other right, remedy
or security, including without limitation any right or remedy against
the Indemnitor. The Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to consent
to, or receive any notice of, any amendment or modification of, or waiver,
release, consent or extension with respect to, or assignment or any agreement
giving rise to an obligation of the Indemnitor hereunder that may be made or
given as provided hereunder. The Guarantor shall have no right to terminate
or revoke this guarantee or to be released or discharged from its obligations
hereunder for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, any such
amendment, or modification of, or waiver, release, consent or extension, any
merger, consolidation, sale of assets or change in the ownership of any
shares of capital stock of the Indemnitor or any permitted assignment by
the     ##### 

 

   

Indemnitor of its right hereunder or any insolvency, bankruptcy,
liquidation, reorganization or cessation of existence of the Indemnitor. The
Guarantor agrees that this guarantee shall be reinstated if and to the extent
that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of the Indemnitor is
rescinded or must be otherwise restored, whether as a result of any
proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise.   

SECTION 17. _Amendments and Waivers_. Neither this Agreement nor any term
hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated except by
an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto, and any
such waiver, discharge or termination shall in no way impair the obligations
of the Indemnitor hereunder or the rights of any other party hereto in any
other respect or at any other time.   

SECTION 18. _Survival_. All warranties, representations and covenants made by
the Indemnitor herein shall be considered to have been relied upon by all the
Indemnified Parties and shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, regardless of any investigation made by any of them or on its or
their behalf.   

SECTION 19. _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement that may be
determined by any competent authority to be prohibited or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof, and the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to replace such prohibited or unenforceable provision by a provision
that is not prohibited or unenforceable and has substantially the same effect
and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Guarantor, the
Indemnitor, the Purchaser and the Beneficiary hereby waives any provisions of
law that renders any provision thereof prohibited or unenforceable in any
respect.   

SECTION 20. _Miscellaneous_.   

 (a) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within that state and without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.   

 (b) _Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief_. In addition to any remedies available at law, each party hereto shall also be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, in the event of any actual or threatened breaches of Sections 12, 13 and 14 of this Agreement by the other party, without the necessity of proof of damages. The parties hereto further agree that disclosure of any of the CSX Privileged Materials in violation of this Agreement would cause the Guarantor imminent and irremediable harm and each of the Beneficiary and the Purchaser hereby consents to allow the Guarantor to seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction for an entry of preliminary injunction to prevent such disclosure. The parties hereto further agree that disclosure of any of the SL Service Privileged Materials in violation of this Agreement would cause one or more of the Beneficiary or the Purchaser imminent and irremediable harm and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to allow the Beneficiary or the Purchaser, if threatened with such harm, to seek injunctive relief in    ##### 

  

  

any court of competent jurisdiction for an entry of preliminary injunction to
prevent such disclosure.   

 (c) _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY AND THAT ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY SHALL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.   

 (d) _Successors and Assigns; Complete Agreement; Headings; Counterparts_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and permitted assigns of each of the parties hereto and each reference to any thereof herein shall include a reference to each such successor or permitted assign. Expect as otherwise set forth in the Purchase Agreement, this Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof. The headings in this Agreement are for purposes of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one instrument.   

 (e) _Notices_. All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals and other instruments hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been properly given if delivered in person, by courier service, by facsimile, by internationally recognized express mail or similar delivery service or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) to the respective parties at the following addresses or facsimile number (or at such other address or number for a party as shall be specified in a notice given in accordance with this Section):

 (f) _Waiver_. No waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and no notice to or demand on the Guarantor or the Indemnitor in any case shall entitle the Guarantor or the Indemnitor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute the waiver of any rights of the parties hereto to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. Except as otherwise provided herein, no failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver hereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.   

 (g) _Enforcement_. The Guarantor or the Indemnitor agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses as incurred by or on behalf of the Purchaser, the Beneficiary or any Indemnified Party or any successor or assignee thereof upon demand therefor in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement or preservation of the rights herein granted (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel). The Indemnitor agrees that any Indemnified Party or any successor or assignee thereof may bring suit against the Indemnitor without joining the Guarantor or any successor or assign thereof.    ##### 

  

  

 (h) _Conflict_. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement or any document or instrument executed and delivered in connection herewith, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail over such other conflicting or inconsistent provisions.   

 (i) _Restriction on Amendment of Residual Liabilities and CSX Obligations_. Except as may be required to comply with applicable law or regulation or a final non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority, each of the Purchaser and the Beneficiary covenants and agrees not to permit or suffer any amendment, modification or addition to the Residual Liabilities and the CSX Obligations that would, or would be reasonably likely to, increase the likelihood of a default thereunder or that would, or would be reasonably likely to, increase the liability of the Beneficiary thereunder. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the Beneficiary may amend, modify or supplement any CSX Residual Liability or CSX Obligation so as to reduce the liability of the Beneficiary thereunder.   

 (j) _Submission to Jurisdiction; Service of Process_. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the United States District Court located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York, New York, and appellate courts from any thereof, and irrevocably waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating directly or indirectly to this Agreement in such court and irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead any claim that such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. To the extent that any party has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, such party hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its obligations with respect to this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court shall be conclusive and binding on it and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each party irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process in any such suit, action or proceeding and any such service of process shall be deemed effective and sufficient, if delivered to such party pursuant to the notice provisions set forth in Section 20(e) hereof. Nothing in this Section 20(j) shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this Section 20(j) shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of New York and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this Section 20(j) and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties hereto and hereunder.   

 (k) _U.S. Currency_. All obligations of the Indemnitor shall be payable in United States Dollars and in immediately available funds and any payment in respect of losses or CSX obligations that are denominated in currencies other than United States Dollars shall be paid in a sufficient amount that can be converted at readily available rates of exchange into the appropriate amounts in the other currency or currencies on the date of payment  .   

 (l) _Notice of Claim_. The Beneficiary agrees to deliver notice to the Indemnitor of the assertion in writing of a claim for payment or performance by the Beneficiary of a CSX Covenant as promptly as practicable, but in any event within 10 days after receipt thereof by the Beneficiary, provided that failure by the Beneficiary to give such notice shall not affect the    ##### 

  

  

obligations of the Indemnitor hereunder, except if and only to the
extent that the Indemnitor shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of
such failure.   

 (m) _Rights of Cure_. The Beneficiary agrees to comply with any written request from the Indemnitor seeking the reasonable cooperation of the Beneficiary in the exercise or attempted exercise by the Indemnitor of any right of cure or other remedy that may be available under the CSX Obligations in respect of a CSX Covenant that has been breached or violated, so long as such cooperation shall not expose the Beneficiary to any liability or expense (other than reasonable general overhead expense) and provided that the Indemnitor is in compliance with its obligations hereunder.
