5 1.11 _Exchange Procedures_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. NPS and Enzon shall appoint a commercial bank,
trust company or other institution to act as the exchange agent for the

holders of shares of NPS Common Stock and Enzon Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with the terms of this _Article I_ , certificates representing the

shares of NPS Common Stock and Enzon Common Stock may be entitled to pursuant
to _Section 1.11(e)_ hereof.



(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Holdco
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the
Effective Time) of, or entitled to, a certificate or certificates (the "

outstanding shares of NPS Common Stock, including, for greater certainty, the
holders (other than NPS or any of its Subsidiaries) of certificates including
Exchangeable Shares purchased by an affiliate of NPS prior to the Effective
Time, and Enzon Common Stock, in each case, whose shares were converted into
the right to receive shares of Holdco Common Stock pursuant to _Section 1.9_
and _Section 1.10_ hereof, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 1.11(d)_ hereof and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
_Section 1.11(e)_ hereof: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the

Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as NPS
and Enzon may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing
whole shares of Holdco Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares
pursuant to _Section 1.11(d)_ hereof and any dividends or other distributions
pursuant to _Section 1.11(e)_ hereof. Upon surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange
Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the number of whole shares of Holdco Common Stock (after
taking into account all Certificates surrendered by such holder) to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section 1.9_ and _Section 1.10_ hereof
(which shall be in uncertificated book entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested or is otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements), payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.11(d)_ hereof and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 1.11(e)_ , and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all
corporate purposes, to evidence the ownership of the number of full shares of
Holdco Common Stock into which such shares of NPS Common Stock or Enzon Common
Stock shall have been so converted and the right to receive an amount in cash
in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with _Section
1.11(d)_ hereof and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 1.11(e)_  hereof.



(d) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Holdco Common Stock
will be issued by virtue of the Mergers, but in lieu thereof each holder of
NPS Common Stock or Enzon Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Holdco Common Stock (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock that otherwise would be received by
such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holders Certificate(s), receive
from the Exchange Agent, at such time as such holder shall receive a
Certificate or Certificates representing shares of Holdco Common Stock as
contemplated by _Section 1.11(c)_ hereof, an amount of cash (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) such fraction, and (ii) the closing price per share of Holdco
Common Stock on the NASDAQ on the trading day immediately succeeding the date
upon which the Effective Time occurs (as reported in the _Wall
Street Journal, National Edition_ ).



 

6 (e) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the date hereof with respect to
Holdco Common Stock, NPS Common Stock or Enzon Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time and no payment in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to _Section 1.11(d)_ hereof will be paid to the holders of any
unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the shares of Holdco Common Stock
represented thereby until the holders of record of such Certificates shall
surrender such Certificates. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements,
following surrender of any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall deliver
to the record holders thereof, without interest (i) promptly after such
surrender, the number of whole shares of Holdco Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor along with payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 1.11(d)_ hereof and the amount of any such dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Holdco Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Holdco Common Stock.



(f) _Transfers of Ownership_. _ _If shares of Holdco Common Stock are
to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered
in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Persons requesting
such exchange will have paid to Holdco or any agent designated by it any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Holdco
Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificates surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Holdco or any
agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.



(g) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Holdco and the
Surviving Corporations shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder or former holder of NPS Common Stock or Enzon Common Stock such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code
or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax laws or under any other
applicable Legal Requirements. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, the amount of such consideration shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
consideration would otherwise have been paid. 



(h) _No Liability_. _ _Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section 1.11_ , none of the Exchange Agent, Holdco, the Surviving
Corporations or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder or former
holder of shares of NPS Common Stock, Enzon Common Stock or Holdco Common
Stock, as the case may be, for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal
Requirement.



(i) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates six (6) months
after the Effective Time shall, at the request of Holdco, be delivered to
Holdco or otherwise on the instruction of Holdco, and any holders of the
Certificates who have not surrendered such Certificates in compliance with
this _Section 1.11_ shall after such delivery to Holdco look only to Holdco
for the shares of Holdco Common Stock pursuant to _Section 1.9_ and _1.10_
hereof, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to _Section 1.11(d)_
hereof and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 1.11(e)_
with respect to the shares of NPS Common Stock or Enzon Common Stock formerly
represented thereby. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed
by holders of shares of NPS Common Stock or Enzon Common Stock immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of Holdco, free and clear
of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.



1.12 _Unvested Common Stock_. If any shares of NPS Common Stock or
Enzon Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are
unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other
agreement with NPS or Enzon, respectively, then the shares of Holdco Common
Stock issued in exchange for such shares of NPS  



 

7  Common Stock or Enzon Common Stock, as applicable, shall also be unvested
and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition, and the certificates representing such shares may accordingly be
marked with appropriate legends. NPS and Enzon each shall take all action that
may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Holdco
will be entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set
forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement.



1.13 _No Further Ownership Rights in Capital Stock of NPS and Enzon_.
All shares of Holdco Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of
shares of NPS Common Stock and Enzon Common Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof (including any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.11(d)
hereof and Section 1.11(e) hereof) shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of NPS Common Stock
or Enzon Common Stock, as the case may be, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of Holdco or the Surviving
Corporations of shares of NPS Common Stock or Enzon Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to Holdco for any reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged in accordance with the terms of this _Article I_.



1.14 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of
Holdco Common Stock, cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be required
pursuant to Section 1.11(d) hereof and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 1.11(e) hereof; _provided, however_ , that Holdco may, in
its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require
the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against the Exchange Agent, Holdco or either of the Surviving
Corporations with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.



1.15 _Tax Consequences_. The parties hereto intend that each of the
Mergers will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a plan of
reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g).



1.16 _Further Action_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporations will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of NPS and Enzon, as the case may be, any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of NPS and Enzon, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporations any
and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporations
as a result of, or in connection with, the Mergers.

Enzon represents and warrants to NPS as follows, subject to the exceptions
specifically disclosed in writing in a disclosure letter (the " _Enzon
Disclosure Letter_ ") delivered by Enzon to NPS, dated as of the date hereof
and certified by each of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial
Officer of Enzon, which certifications shall provide that each such person has

and authority to own, lease and operate  



 

8  its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Enzon, and is duly
qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its
properties makes such qualification necessary other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to so qualify or to be good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Enzon.



(b) _Charter Documents_. Enzon has delivered or made available to NPS:
(i) a true and correct copy of the Certificate of Incorporation (including any
Certificate of Designations) and Bylaws of Enzon, each as amended to
date (collectively, the " _Enzon Charter Documents_ ") and (ii) the

(collectively, " _Subsidiary Charter Documents_ "), of each of
its Subsidiaries, and each such instrument is in full force and effect. Enzon
is not in material violation of any of the provisions of the Enzon Charter

Enzon or any of their respective properties are bound or affected. _Section

Disclosure Letter; and (v) such other consents, authorizations, filings,
approvals and registrations which if not obtained or made would not be

consent, approval, order, authorization, registration, declaration or filings.
The consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations
and filings set forth in (i) through (v) are referred to herein as the "
_Necessary Consents_ " (provided that for the purposes of the definition of "

the requirements of FMLA, the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996, the requirements of the Womens Health and
Cancer Rights Act of 1998, the requirements of the Newborns and Mothers
Health Protection Act of 1996, or any amendment to each such act, or any
similar provisions of state law applicable to its Enzon Employees.



(g) Neither Enzon nor any of its ERISA Affiliates is obligated to provide
any Enzon Employee with any compensation or benefits pursuant to an agreement
( _e.g._ , an acquisition agreement) with a former employer of such Enzon
Employee.



(h) Neither Enzon nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has violated Section 306
or 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the execution of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, to the
knowledge of Enzon, cause such a violation.



(i) The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not (either alone or upon the occurrence
of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any Enzon
Benefit Plan, Enzon Employee Agreement, trust or loan that will or may result
in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,
forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Enzon Employee. No payment or
benefit which will or may be made by Enzon or its ERISA Affiliates with
respect to any Enzon Employee or any other "disqualified individual" (as
defined in Code Section 280G and the regulations thereunder) is, individually
or collectively, reasonably likely to be characterized as a "parachute
payment," within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. There is no
contract, agreement, plan or arrangement to which Enzon or any of its ERISA
Affiliates is a party or by which it is bound to compensate any Enzon
Employee for excise taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code.

amounts required by applicable Legal Requirements or by Contract to be
withheld and reported with respect to wages, salaries and other payments to

foregoing with respect to Enzon Employees, and (iv) is not liable for any
material payment to any Governmental Authority or trust or other fund governed
by or maintained by or on behalf of any Governmental Authority, with respect
to unemployment compensation benefits, social security, employment
insurance benefits, health premiums or other benefits or obligations for
Enzon Employees (other than routine payments to be made in the normal course
of business and consistent with past practice). There are no pending,
threatened or reasonably anticipated claims or actions against Enzon or any
of its ERISA Affiliates under any workers compensation policy, workplace
safety and insurance legislation or long-term disability policy. Neither Enzon
nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has direct or indirect liability with respect
to any misclassification of any person as an independent contractor rather
than as an employee, or with respect to any employee leased from another
employer, except as would not result in material harm to Enzon. Each current
Enzon Employee who performs services in the United States is an "at-will"
employee whose employment can be terminated by Enzon or one of its ERISA
Affiliates at any time, with or without cause.



(k) No work stoppage, lock-out, labor strike or other labor disturbance
against Enzon or any of its ERISA Affiliates is pending, threatened or
reasonably anticipated. Enzon has no knowledge of any activities or  



 

20  proceedings of any labor union to organize any Enzon Employees. There are no
actions, suits, claims, labor disputes or grievances pending, or, to the
knowledge of Enzon, threatened or reasonably anticipated relating to any
labor, employment, health and safety, workplace safety and insurance, human
rights, pay equity, employment equity or discrimination matters involving any
Enzon Employee which, if adversely determined, would, individually or in the
aggregate, result in any material liability to Enzon, NPS, Holdco or either of
the Surviving Corporations. Neither Enzon nor any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in any unfair labor practices within the meaning of the National
Labor Relations Act or under comparable Legal Requirements, except as would
not result in material harm to Enzon. Neither Enzon nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates is presently, or has been in the past, a party to, or bound by,
any collective bargaining agreement, works council agreement or union contract
with respect to Enzon Employees and no collective bargaining agreement is
being negotiated with respect to Enzon Employees. Neither Enzon nor any of
its Subsidiaries have incurred any material liability or material obligation
under the WARN Act or any similar Legal Requirement that remains unsatisfied.



(l) Neither Enzon nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has, or has ever had, the
obligation to maintain, establish, sponsor, participate in, or contribute to
any International Benefit Plan.



2.15 _Environmental Matters_.

and in a manner that could not reasonably be expected to subject Enzon or any
of its Subsidiaries to liability, to the knowledge of Enzon and its
Subsidiaries after reasonable inquiry, no Hazardous Materials are present on
any Enzon Business Facility currently owned, operated, occupied, controlled or

and conditions of any Environmental Permit which is or has been in force with
respect to their Hazardous Materials Activities. No circumstances exist which
could cause any Environmental Permit to be revoked, modified, or rendered non-
renewable upon payment of the permit fee.



(d) No action, proceeding, revocation proceeding, amendment procedure,
writ, injunction or claim is pending, or to the best of Enzons knowledge,
threatened, concerning or relating to any Environmental Permit, any Hazardous
Material, or any Hazardous Material Activity of Enzon or any of its
Subsidiaries.



(e) Neither Enzon nor any of its Subsidiaries has knowledge of any fact or
circumstance, which could result in any environmental liability which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Enzon.

jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing

any NPS Benefit Plan. There are no actions, suits or claims pending, or, to
the knowledge of NPS, threatened or reasonably anticipated (other than routine
claims for benefits) in respect of any NPS Benefit Plan or the assets of any
NPS Benefit Plan. Each NPS Benefit Plan (other than stock option plans)
can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time
in accordance with its terms, without liability to NPS, Enzon, Holdco or any

"funded welfare plan" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code, or (v)
any pension plan that is subject to Canadian pension legislation other than
the Canada Pension Plans No NPS Benefit Plan provides health benefits that
are not fully insured through an insurance contract.



(e) No NPS Benefit Plan provides, or reflects or represents any liability
to provide post-termination or retiree welfare benefits to any person for any
reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable Legal
Requirements, and neither NPS nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has ever
represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any
NPS Employee (either individually or to NPS Employees as a group) or any
other person that such NPS Employee(s) or other person would be provided with
post-termination or retiree welfare benefits, except to the extent required by
any Legal Requirements.



(f) Neither NPS nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has violated in any
material respect any of the health care continuation requirements of COBRA,

or 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the execution of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, to the
knowledge of NPS, cause such a violation.



(i) The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not (either alone or upon the occurrence
of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any NPS
Benefit Plan, NPS Employee Agreement, trust or loan that will or may result
in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,
forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any NPS Employee. No payment or
benefit which will or may be made by NPS or its ERISA Affiliates with respect
to any NPS Employee or any other "disqualified individual" (as defined in Code

reasonably likely to be characterized as a "parachute payment," within the

made in the normal course of business and consistent with past practice).
There are no pending, threatened or reasonably anticipated claims or actions
against NPS or any of its ERISA Affiliates under any workers compensation
policy, workplace safety and insurance legislation or long-term disability
policy. Neither NPS nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has direct or indirect
liability with respect to any misclassification of any person as an
independent contractor rather than as an employee, or with respect to any
employee leased from another employer, except as would not result in material
harm to Enzon. Each current NPS Employee who performs services in the United
States is an "at-will" employee whose employment can be terminated by NPS or
one of its ERISA Affiliates at any time, with or without cause.



(k) No work stoppage, lock-out, labor strike or other labor disturbance
against NPS or any of its ERISA Affiliates is pending, threatened or
reasonably anticipated. NPS has no knowledge of any activities or proceedings
of any labor union to organize any NPS Employees. There are no actions,
suits, claims, labor disputes or grievances pending, or, to the knowledge of
NPS, threatened or reasonably anticipated relating to any employment, labor,
health and safety, workplace safety and insurance, human rights, pay
equity, employment equity or discrimination matters involving any NPS
Employee which, if adversely determined, would, individually or in the
aggregate, result in any material liability to NPS or any of its Subsidiaries,

any of its Subsidiaries have incurred any material liability or material
obligation under the WARN Act or any similar Legal Requirements that
remains unsatisfied.



(l) In respect of NPSs International Benefit Plans:



(i) there are no unfunded liabilities that, as of the Effective Time, will
not be offset by insurance or fully accrued;



(ii) except as required by applicable Legal Requirements, no condition
exists that would prevent NPS or Holdco from terminating or amending any such
plan at any time for any reason without liability to NPS, Enzon, Holdco or any
of their respective ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary administration
expenses or routine claims for benefits);



(iii) each plan which has or purports to have Tax-favored treatment
satisfies in all material respects the conditions for Tax-favored treatment
under applicable Legal Requirements and each plan which purports to qualify as
a particular type of plan for Tax purposes meets in all material respects the
requirements for such qualification;



 

37 (iv) there has not been in any material respect any withdrawal of,
application for, or payment of any surplus or other funds out of any such plan
except in accordance with the terms of such plan and applicable Legal
Requirements; and

years respecting any such plan which is registered under applicable Legal
Requirements which would result in the revocation of that registration.

threatened, concerning or relating to any Environmental Permit, any Hazardous

its financial advisor), is, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior
Offer, it may then take the following actions (but only if and to the extent

the case may be) may withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation
in favor of the transaction contemplated hereby, and (ii) with respect to a

information made available to the Person or group making the Superior Offer
in connection with such Superior Offer;



(4) its board of directors has concluded in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer, the
failure of the board of directors to take such action is reasonably likely to

assumed by Holdco under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject
to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable NPS Option
(including any applicable stock option agreement or other document evidencing
such NPS Option) immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any
repurchase rights or vesting provisions), except that (i) each NPS Option will
be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for
that number of whole shares of Holdco Common Stock equal to the product of the
number of shares of NPS Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such
NPS Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the NPS
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Holdco
Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Holdco
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed NPS Option will be equal
to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of NPS
Common Stock at which such NPS Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the NPS Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent. Each assumed NPS Option shall be vested immediately following the
Effective Time as to the same percentage of the total number of shares subject
thereto as it was vested as to immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except to the extent such NPS Option by its terms in effect prior to the date
hereof provides for acceleration of vesting. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time, Holdco shall issue to each Person who holds an
assumed NPS Option a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such NPS
Option by Holdco. The conversion of NPS Options provided for in this _Section
5.9(a)(i)_ , with respect to any NPS Options which are intended to be
"incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be
effected in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.



(ii) At the Effective Time, Holdco shall assume the NPS ESPP and each
outstanding purchase right held by NPS Employees who are then participating
in the NPS ESPP (the " _NPS Purchase Plan Options_ "). Each NPS Purchase Plan
Option so assumed by Holdco shall continue to have, and be subject to the same
terms and conditions set forth in the NPS ESPP, except that the shares of NPS
Common Stock reserved for issuance under the NPS ESPP shall be converted into
shares of Holdco Common Stock based on the NPS Exchange Ratio and the fair
market value per share of NPS Common Stock at the beginning of each offering
period in effect as of the Effective Time shall be equal to the fair market
value per share of the NPS Common Stock at the beginning of each such offering
period divided by the NPS Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent. NPS, Enzon and Holdco shall take all action that may be necessary (under
the NPS ESPP and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this _Section
5.9(a)(ii)_ and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of
NPS Purchase Plan Options and Employees of NPS participating in the NPS ESPP
after the Effective Time have no rights with respect to the NPS ESPP that are
inconsistent with this _Section 5.9(a)(ii)_. To the extent that Holdco
maintains an Employee Stock Purchase Plan following the Effective Time
(including the NPS ESPP), Enzon employees will be able to participate in such
plan to the same extent as similarly situated NPS Employees.



(b) _Enzon Options_. Except as provided below, each outstanding Enzon
Option shall accelerate and become fully vested in accordance with the terms
of the applicable Enzon Option Plan, and to the extent not exercised prior to
the Effective Time shall terminate and cease to represent a right to
acquire shares of Enzon Common Stock. Enzon shall provide a notice to the
optionees no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the Effective Time
informing them of such acceleration and that any such Enzon Options not
exercised prior to the Effective Time shall terminate as of the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Enzon Options held by the individuals
listed on _Section 5.9(b)_ of the Enzon Disclosure Letter and outstanding as
of the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of
Enzon Common Stock and shall be assumed by Holdco. Each Enzon Option so
assumed by Holdco under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject
to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Enzon Option
(including any applicable stock option agreement or other document evidencing
such Enzon Option) immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any
repurchase rights or vesting provisions), except that (a) each Enzon Option
will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms)
for that number of whole shares of Holdco Common Stock equal to the  



 

51  product of the number of shares of Enzon Common Stock that were issuable
upon exercise of such Enzon Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Enzon Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Holdco Common Stock, and (b) the per share exercise price
for the shares of Holdco Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed
Enzon Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the
exercise price per share of Enzon Common Stock at which such Enzon Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Enzon Exchange
Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each assumed Enzon Option shall
be vested immediately following the Effective Time as to the same percentage
of the total number of shares subject thereto as it was vested as to
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent such Enzon
Option by its terms in effect prior to the date hereof provides for
acceleration of vesting. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time, Holdco shall issue to each Person who holds an assumed Enzon
Option a document evidencing the foregoing conversion of such Enzon Options
to options to acquire Holdco shares. The conversion of Enzon Options provided
for in this _Section 5.9(b)_ , with respect to any Enzon Options which are
intended to be "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the
Code) shall be effected in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the
Code.



(c) _Holdco Arrangements_.



(i) As of the Effective Time, Holdco shall adopt and implement a stock
option plan or plans pursuant to which Holdco shall grant options to acquire
shares of Holdco Common Stock (the " _Holdco Options_ "). The aggregate amount
of Holdco Options to be available for grant following the Effective Time
pursuant to such Holdco option plan or plans will be determined by the Holdco
Board following the Effective Time, _provided_ that the aggregate number of
Holdco Options and the methodology for allocation of such options shall be
determined in accordance with _Section 5.9(c)_ of the Enzon Disclosure
Letter.



(ii) Holdco shall, effective as of the Effective Time, (A) assume the NPS
Option Plans and (B) implement the stock option plan(s) in accordance with
_Section 5.9(c)(i)_ (collectively, the " _Holdco Plans_ "). Holdco shall also
reserve a sufficient number of shares of Holdco Common Stock for issuance
pursuant to the exercise of all NPS Options in accordance with _Section
5.9(a)(i)_ hereof and the exercise of Holdco Options granted in accordance
with _Section 5.9(c)(i)_ hereof.



(iii) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Holdco shall cause
the shares of Holdco Common Stock issuable upon exercise of all NPS Options
assumed by Holdco pursuant to _Section 5.9(a)(i)_ hereof and shares issuable
upon the exercise of Holdco Options pursuant to _Section 5.9(c)(i)_ and the
shares of Holdco Common Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to future grants
or awards under the assumed NPS Option Plans and Holdco Option Plans to be
registered under the Securities Act on Form S-8 (the " _Form S-8_ ")
promulgated by the SEC (to the extent available therefor), and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the Form S-8
for so long as any such assumed NPS Options or NPS Option Plans shall remain
outstanding or in effect, as the case may be.



5.10 _Employee Matters_. Following the Effective Time, Holdco shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to give each Continuing Employee full
credit for prior service with NPS or its Subsidiaries and Enzon or its
Subsidiaries for purposes of (i) eligibility and vesting under any Holdco
Plans, and (ii) determination of benefits levels under any vacation or
severance Holdco Plans, in each case except where such crediting would (A)
result in a duplication of benefits or (B) otherwise cause Holdco or any
Holdco Plans or trust relating thereto to accrue or pay for benefits that
relate to any time period prior to the Continuing Employees participation in
the Holdco Plans.



5.11 _Indemnification_.



(a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time, Holdco and
the Surviving Corporations shall jointly and severally fulfill and honor in
all respects the obligations of each of NPS and Enzon pursuant to any
indemnification agreements between NPS, Enzon and their respective current and
former directors and  



 

52  officers (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), subject to applicable Legal
Requirements. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Holdco and each
of the Surviving Corporations will contain provisions with respect to
exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws of NPS or Enzon, as applicable, as in effect on the date hereof,
which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees or agents of NPS or
Enzon, as applicable, unless such modification is required by applicable Legal
Requirements.



(b) _Insurance_. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time, Holdco shall cause to be maintained directors and officers liability
insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by directors and
officers liability insurance policies of NPS and Enzon in effect as of the
date hereof (the " _Insured Parties_ ") on terms comparable to those
applicable to the current directors and officers of NPS and Enzon for a
period of six (6) years.



(c) _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. The terms of this _Section 5.11_ are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by
the Indemnified Parties and the Insured Parties and their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its
successors and assigns. In the event that Holdco or either of the Surviving
Corporations (or any of the respective successors or assigns) (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successor or assign of Holdco or either of the Surviving Corporations, as the
case may be, honors the obligations set forth with respect to Holdco and the
Surviving Corporations, as the case may be, in this _Section 5.11_.



5.12 _Governance Matters_. __

" _includes_ " and " _including_ ," when used herein, shall be deemed in each
case to be followed by the words " _without limitation_."



(e) For all purposes of and under this Agreement, unless otherwise
indicated, when reference is made in this Agreement to NPS, Enzon or Holdco,
or any of their respective business, as the case may be, such reference shall
be deemed to include NPS, Enzon or Holdco and their respective Subsidiaries
(including, in the case of Holdco, the Surviving Corporations), taken as a
whole, or the respective businesses of NPS, Enzon or Holdco and their
respective Subsidiaries (including, in the case of Holdco, the Surviving

9.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.



9.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and
instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by
or referred to herein, including the Enzon Disclosure Letter and the  



 

71  NPS Disclosure Letter, constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof, it being understood that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing and shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.



9.6 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the documents and
instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by
or referred to herein, including the Enzon Disclosure Letter and the NPS

or remedies hereunder, except as specifically provided, following the
Effective Time, in _Section 5.11_ hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, it
is expressly understood and agreed that the provisions of _Sections 5.10_ ,

Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such

reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further

unenforceable provision.

(a) _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative

preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. 



(b) _Specific Performance_. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in
any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.



9.10 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of parties irrevocably agrees
that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or for
recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by the
other party hereto or its successors or assigns may be brought and determined
in the Chancery or other Courts of the State of Delaware, and each of parties
hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for
itself and in respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. 



9.11 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Legal Requirement or
rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.



 

72 9.12 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties. Any purported assignment in violation of this
_Section 9.11_ shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.



9.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF HOLDCO, NPS AND ENZON HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
